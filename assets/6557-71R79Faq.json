The carcinogenic effects of isoprene were observed after a 26-week exposure (6 hr/day, 5 days/week) of male mice to 700 ppm or higher concentrations of isoprene followed by a 26-week recovery period. Unlike BD, isoprene did not induce lymphomas or hemangiosarcomas of the heart in mice under these conditions nor did it induce chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow cells. No toxicological effects were evident in rats exposed for 13 weeks to either isoprene or BD at concentrations up to 7000 ppm or 8000 ppm, respectively. Interstitial cell hyperplasia of the testis was observed in male F344 rats exposed to 7000 ppm isoprene for 26 weeks, and following a 26-week recovery period, there was a marginal increase in benign testicular interstitial cell tumors."

Ten groups were exposed for 8 hr/day, 5 days/week as follows (ppm-weeks): 0-80, 10-80, 70-40, 70-80, 140-40, 280-20, 280-80, 700-80, 2200-40, 2200-80. Two groups were exposed for 4 hr/day: 2200-20, 2200-80. Groups were held until 96 or 105 weeks on study. The concentration x time (duration of exposure) values provided a series of theoretically equivalent exposure hazards. There was an exposure-related increased incidence of liver, lung, Harderian gland and forestomach tumors, and hemangiosarcomas and histiocytic sarcomas. The LOEL appeared to be 70 ppm. These results are similar to the profile of tumors seen in 1,3-butadiene (BD)-exposed mice without the early onset of T-cell lymphoma as seen with BD. Isoprene appears to be about one order of magnitude less potent than BD in mice. Statistical analyses indicated that the product of isoprene concentration, and length/duration of exposure was not a sufficient basis for predicting tumor risk at any site. Extrapolation of tumor probability between the high and low doses based on cumulative exposure was not appropriate and could not be justified by statistical models. A threshold effect level and strong nonlinearities with respect to concentration appeared to exist for tumor development in this study."

Isoprene, like butadiene, requires metabolic activation to reactive epoxides to exhibit its carcinogenic properties. The mode of action has been postulated to be that of a genotoxic carcinogen, with the formation of promutagenic DNA adducts being essential for mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. In rodents, isoprene-induced tumors show unique point mutations (A-->T transversions) in the K-ras protooncogene at codon 61. Therefore, we investigated adducts formed after the reaction of 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAdo ) with the two monoepoxides of isoprene, 2-ethenyl-2-methyloxirane (IP-1,2-O) and propen-2-yloxirane (IP-3,4-O), under physiological conditions.

            "Value": "The Koc of isoprene is estimated as 125(SRC), using a log Kow of 2.42(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that isoprene is expected to have high mobility in soil."
