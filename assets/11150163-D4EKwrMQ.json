    "Description": "Metalaxyl-M is a methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alaninate that is the more active R-enantiomer of metalaxyl. A systemic fungicide, it is active against phytopathogens of the order Peronosporales and is used to conrtrol Pythium in a number of vegetable crops. It has a role as an agrochemical. It is a methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alaninate, a D-alanine derivative, an acylamino acid fungicide and an anilide fungicide. It is functionally related to a D-alanine. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-metalaxyl.",

            "content": "Production of chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora) in greenhouses often requires intensive pesticide use, raising concerns about food safety and human health. This study investigated the uptake, translocation, and residue dissipation of typical fungicides (metalaxyl-M and fludioxonil) and insecticides (cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam) in greenhouse chrysanthemum when applied to soils. Chrysanthemum plants absorbed these pesticides from soils to various degrees, with bioconcentration factors (BCF) positively correlated with the lipophilicity (log Kow) of pesticides. The highly lipophilic fludioxonil (log Kow = 4.12) had the greatest BCF (2.96 \u00b1 0.41 g/g), while the hydrophilic thiamethoxam (log Kow = 0.13) had the lowest (0.09 \u00b1 0.03 g/g). Translocation factors (TF) from roots to shoots followed the order of TF_leaf > TF_stem > TF_flower. Metalaxyl-M and cyantraniliprole, with medium lipophilicity (log Kow of 1.71 and 2.02, respectively), and hydrophilic thiamethoxam showed relatively strong translocation potentials with TF values in the range of 0.29\u20130.81, 0.36\u20132.74, and 0.30\u20131.03, respectively.",

A mixed pesticide solution (200 mL) was prepared at the manufacturer-recommended dose (3.2, 2.1, 4.3, and 4.3 kg/ha for metalaxyl-M, fludioxonil, cyantraniliprole, and thiamethoxam, respectively).",
