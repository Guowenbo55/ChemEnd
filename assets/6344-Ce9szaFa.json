            "Value": "The mechanism by which methylene chloride induces mammary adenomas in the rat is important for human hazard assessment. Female Sprague- Dawley rats receiving methylene chloride have a high blood level of prolactin. In common with the response to other agents which act via hyperprolactinaemia, the methylene chloride-induced response is of benign neoplasms only. There is no evidence for the binding of methylene chloride to the DNA of other tissues and hence it seems unlikely that it will bind to mammary tissue when the primary site of metabolism is the liver. It seems most likely, therefore, that the increased incidence of mammary adenomas is the result of an indirect mechanism operating via hyperprolactinaemia."

            "Value": "Dichloromethane (DCM) is a hepatic and pulmonary carcinogen in mice exposed to high doses by inhalation. It has been shown previously that the incidence of liver and lung tumors does not increase in rats or hamsters exposed to the dihaloalkane under conditions similar to those that produced tumors in mice. The biological consequences of DCM exposure to humans is therefore uncertain. The carcinogenic effects of DCM in the mouse are caused by the interaction with DNA of a glutathione (GSH) conjugate that is produced by the class theta glutathione S-transferase T1-1 (GST T1-1). The species specificity is thought to be due to the greater amount of transferase activity in mouse target organs and specific nuclear localization of GST T1-1 in target cells. This paper directly compares the relative capacity and locality of DCM activation in mouse and human tissues. The results show that mouse GST T1-1 is more efficient in catalyzing the conjugation of DCM with GSH than the orthologous human enzyme. In addition, the mouse expresses higher levels of the transferase than humans in hepatic tissue. Histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of GST T1-1 in the nucleus of mouse liver cells. However, in human liver GST T1-1 was detected in bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocyte nuclei but was also present in the cytoplasm. Taking this information into account, it is unlikely that humans have a sufficiently high capacity to activate DCM for this compound to be considered to represent a carcinogenic risk."

Laboratory studies have shown an increased incidence of lung and liver cancer in mice but not in rats or hamsters. Despite the correlation between metabolism of DCM by the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pathway and the occurrence of tumors in different species, the mechanism of tumor induction by DCM metabolites produced through the GST pathway remains unclear. In this study a V79 cell line stably transfected with the murine GST theta 1 gene (mGSTT1) was compared to the parent cell line (MZ) to determine how the construct affects DCM metabolism and the sensitivity of the cell line to DNA damage and cytotoxicity. V79 cells were treated with DCM (2.5-10mM) or formaldehyde (150-600muM) for 2hr. Also, formaldehyde produced by V79 cytosol metabolism of DCM was measured spectrophotometrically. DNA damage and DNA-protein crosslinks were measured by the standard and proteinase K-modified alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCG) assays. Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue stain exclusion, the Live/Dead((R)) cell viability/cytotoxicity kit for animal cells, and the neutral red assay. After DCM treatment a significant concentration-dependent increase in tail moment in the V79 MZ cells was observed compared to a significant concentration-dependent decrease in tail moment in the V79 mGSTT1 cells. Post-incubation with proteinase K significantly increased DNA migrations in DCM-treated V79 mGSTT1 cells. DCM formed significantly higher levels of formaldehyde in the cytosol of the V79 mGSTT1 cells than in the cytosol of the V79 MZ cells. Results using the cytotoxicity assays were comparable using the trypan blue and Live/Dead((R)) assays, neither showing a difference in response between the two cell lines when exposed to either formaldehyde or DCM. These results indicate that V79 mGSTT1 can metabolize DCM to a genotoxic and cytotoxic metabolite, which is likely formaldehyde..."

Current occupational exposure limits are designed to protect workers on the standard 8-hr/day workshift and are not intended for use for longer workshifts. Experiments were conducted to compare the effects of a 12-hr exposure schedule to those of an 8-hr schedule on the carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) formation resulting from dichloromethane (DCM) inhalation. Rats and mice were exposed to 200, 500, or 1000 ppm DCM for 8 hr/day for 5 days or 12 hr/day for 4 days. The effect of the unusual exposure schedule on COHb levels was not significant. The metabolic pathway for the formation of COHb appeared to be saturated even at the lowest concentration of DCM. To examine the possible increase in the retention of inhaled DCM in the longer exposure schedule, single exposures for 8 and 12 hr were compared. The peak blood DCM level was dependent upon the DCM exposure concentration, but the half-life was independent of the duration of exposure and the concentration of DCM. The half-life of COHb in blood was prolonged by increasing the DCM concentration, but was not affected by the exposure period. Pyrazole treatment decreased COHb level and increased blood DCM level in rats exposed to DCM. These results suggest that the exposure limit for a chemical with a short biological half-life and readily reversible toxic effect may not need to be adjusted for a longer workshift which is in agreement with some of the mathematical models based upon the pharmacokinetics of a toxicant."

DCM of orbital sinus blood declined to negligible levels with 2 hr postexposure in both sedentary and exercised rats, with higher levels occurring at the 1000-ppm exposure. The carboxylHb (COHb) levels in rats exposed to 500 ppm DCM were similar in exercised and sedentary rats; at 1000 ppm DCM all levels were higher, but there were small decreases in the COHb of the exercised group compared to the sedentary group.

Rats and hamsters were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 2 yr. No exposure related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Female rats exposed to 3500 ppm had an increased mortality rate while female hamsters exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had decreased mortality rates. Carboxyhemoglobin values were evaluated in rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm with the percentage increase in hamsters greater than in rats. Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. While the number of female rats with a benign tumor was not increased, the total number of benign mammary tumors was increased in female rats in an exposure-related manner. This effect was also evident in male rats in the 1500- and 3500-ppm exposure groups. Finally, male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sarcomas ... located in or around the salivary glands. Therefore, in this 2 yr study, some effects were observed in male and female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride. In contrast, hamsters exposed to the same concentrations had less extensive spontaneous geriatric changes, decreased mortality (females), and lacked evidence of definite target organ toxicity."

The dependence of mammary tumors upon pituitary hormones in both male and female rats has been established unequivocally. In the rat, prolactin acts as both an initiator and promoter of mammary carcinogenesis. There is good evidence that increased prolactin levels increase the incidence of mammary tumors (e.g., the grafting of multiple pituitary glands into Sprague-Dawley rats increases the incidence of mammary tumours and there is a positive correlation between elevated blood prolactin levels and mammary tumors in aged R-Amsterdam female rats)."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ Genotoxicity in cells may occur in different ways, direct interaction, production of electrophilic metabolites, and secondary genotoxicity via oxidative stress. Chloroform, dichloromethane, and toluene are primarily metabolized in liver by CYP2E1, producing reactive electrophilic metabolites, and may also produce oxidative stress via the uncoupled CYP2E1 catalytic cycle. Additionally, GSTT1 also participates in dichloromethane activation. Despite the oxidative metabolism of these compounds and the production of oxidative adducts, their genotoxicity in the bone marrow micronucleus test is unclear. The objective of this work was to analyze whether the oxidative metabolism induced by the coexposure to these compounds would account for increased micronucleus frequency. The study used an approach including the analysis of phase I, phase II, and antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers, and micronuclei in bone marrow (MNPCE) and hepatocytes (MNHEP). Rats were administered different doses of an artificial mixture of CLF/DCM/TOL, under two regimes. After one administration MNPCE frequency increased in correlation with induced GSTT1 activity and no oxidative stress occurred. Conversely, after three-day treatments oxidative stress was observed, without genotoxicity. The effects observed indicate that MNPCE by the coexposure to these VOCs could be increased via inducing the activity of metabolism enzymes."

For this purpose, Sprague-Dawley rats of both genders were exposed by inhalation to a single high dose (5000 ppm) of methylene chloride for 6 hr/d, 5 d/wk for 28 d. This was considered the relevant route of administration, as not only is inhalation a primary route for human exposure to methylene chloride, but, also, the chemical is absorbed rapidly via the lungs. Under these conditions of exposure, methylene chloride failed to influence absolute or relative thymus weights in either gender and produced a significant reduction in relative, but not absolute, spleen weight in female rats only. Immunocompetence was measured as a function of the ability of treated animals to mount immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Exposure to methylene chloride did not affect antibody production. Evidence indicates that under these conditions of exposure, methylene chloride did not compromise immune function."

Approximately 1,100 protein spots that were detected by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed reproducible abundance. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to characterize the changes in the liver proteome in response to DCM exposure. Consequently, 7 of these spots showed significant changes in expression level after DCM treatment. These proteins were 3 paralogues of glutathione S-transferase, beta 1 globin, 2 hemoglobin beta-2 and alpha-2 globulin. Of these, the expression of alpha-2 globulin was also confirmed by Western blot. The differential expression of these proteins might be caused by DCM exposure."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Dichloromethane (DCM) is a hepatic and pulmonary carcinogen in mice exposed to high doses by inhalation. It has been shown previously that the incidence of liver and lung tumors does not increase in rats or hamsters exposed to the dihaloalkane under conditions similar to those that produced tumors in mice. The biological consequences of DCM exposure to humans is therefore uncertain. The carcinogenic effects of DCM in the mouse are caused by the interaction with DNA of a glutathione (GSH) conjugate that is produced by the class theta glutathione S-transferase T1-1 (GST T1-1). The species specificity is thought to be due to the greater amount of transferase activity in mouse target organs and specific nuclear localization of GST T1-1 in target cells. This paper directly compares the relative capacity and locality of DCM activation in mouse and human tissues. The results show that mouse GST T1-1 is more efficient in catalyzing the conjugation of DCM with GSH than the orthologous human enzyme. In addition, the mouse expresses higher levels of the transferase than humans in hepatic tissue. Histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of GST T1-1 in the nucleus of mouse liver cells. However, in human liver GST T1-1 was detected in bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocyte nuclei but was also present in the cytoplasm. Taking this information into account, it is unlikely that humans have a sufficiently high capacity to activate DCM for this compound to be considered to represent a carcinogenic risk."
