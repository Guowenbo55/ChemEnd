            "Value": "AEROBIC: In soil, microbial degradation of propazine occurs, with hydrolysis of the chlorine atom to give hydroxypropazine, dealkylation of both substituted amino groups, presumably followed by ring opening and decomposition(1). The half-life in soil is approximately 80-100 days(1). Propazine was 36-64% degraded in a series of aerobic soil beds over a 54 week incubation period and 5.7-75% degraded in a series of anaerobic/aerobic cycled soil beds over a 54 week incubation period(2). In lab tests, no 14-CO2 release was observed in 16 weeks from a silt loam soil treated with propazine labeled with 14-C in the triazine ring(3). Two to fourteen months time has been reported as the time required for decomposition of propazine applied at \"normal\" application rates in soil(4); however, it was not reported whether this refers to total degradation of parent herbicide as well as active metabolites(SRC). The half-lives for degradation (purportedly mainly soil-catalyzed hydrolysis) of propazine in Hatzenbuhl soil at pH 4.8 and Neuhofen soil at pH 6.5 are 62 and 127 days, respectively(5). It has been reported that s-triazines which are similar in structure to propazine can be utilized by certain soil microorganisms as a source of energy(6)."

            "Value": "... Propazine has been grouped with several structurallyrelated, chlorinated triazines (e.g., atrazine, simazine, and 3 chlorotriazine degradates common to atrazine, simazine and propazine) on the basis of a common mechanism of toxicity for disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. As a result of their common mechanism of toxicity, exposure to propazine, like exposure to atrazine, results in reproductive and developmental effects and consequences that are considered relevant to humans. These effects form the basis of the regulatory endpoint selection for both compounds. This mechanism involves a central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, specifically, neurotransmitter and neuropeptide alterations at the level of the hypothalamus, which cause cascading changes to hormone levels, e.g., suppression of the luteinizing hormone surge prior to ovulation resulting in prolonged estrus in adult female rats (demonstrated with atrazine and propazine), and developmental delays, i.e., delayed vaginal opening and preputial separation in developing rats (studied in atrazine and propazine). These neuroendocrine effects are considered the primary toxicological effects of regulatory concern. The NOAEL for endocrine changes is protective of systemic toxicity."

            "Value": "After subchronic and chronic exposure to propazine, a variety of species were shown to exhibit neuroendocrine effects resulting in both reproductive and developmental consequences that are considered relevant to humans. These neuroendocrine effects are biomarkers of a neuroendocrine mechanism of toxicity that is shared by several other structurally-related chlorinated triazines including atrazine, simazine, and three chlorinated degradates - G-28279 (des-isopropyl atrazine or DIA), and G-30033 (des-ethyl atrazine or DEA), and G-28273 (diaminochlorotriazine or DACT) -  the latter two which can result from the degradation of propazine. These six compounds disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, part of the central nervous system, causing cascading changes to hormone levels and developmental delays. For propazine, a neuroendocrine endpoint was identified for chronic dietary exposure based on adverse effects of estrous cycle alterations and luteinizing hormone (LH) surge suppression observed in a LH surge study on female rats exposed to atrazine. The corresponding NOAEL was 1.8 mg/kg/day. Because the database for propazine's potential neuroendocrine effects is less robust than the atrazine database, particularly for the young, the /EPA/ concluded that atrazine data could be used as bridging data for propazine due to the fact that propazine and atrazine share the neuroendocrine mechanism of toxicity described above, and that these neuroendocrine effects are considered the primary toxicological effects of regulatory concern for chronic exposure."

Bioassay studies showed sorghum to be tolerant and wheat susceptible to terbutryn. Absorption and translocation of uniform 14C-labeled terbutryn from 1 to 24 hr after initial treatment showed the roots of sorghum and the foliage of wheat to be the major sites of radioactivity accumulation. Foliage was the major site for propazine accumulation with both plant species. Thin-layer chromatography of extracts from terbutryn-treated plants showed that sorghum contained a higher percentage of metabolic breakdown products in the foliage than did the root systems, and wheat contained a high percentage of intact terbutryn in the foliage and roots. High temperature (32 C) enhanced translocation of terbutryn and propazine in both sorghum and wheat. The susceptibility of wheat and sorghum to terbutryn appears to be correlated with a combination of the factors of accumulation within the foliage of the plant and the ability to degrade the terbutryn molecule.",
