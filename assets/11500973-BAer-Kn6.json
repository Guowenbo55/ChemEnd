            "content": "Methiozolin, when applied via foliage, displays an absorption rate of up to 55% within the foliage itself, indicating its systemic properties. The translocation of methiozolin after foliar application reveals a predominant movement towards the upper regions of the plant (about 10% of the applied amount). Conversely, minimal translocation is observed to the lower regions of the target leaf (1.4% below the target area) and to other parts of the plant (1.3% beyond the target leaf). This upward movement suggests limited basipetal translocation and implies a lack of methiozolin movement through the phloem. Additionally, when applied to the roots, methiozolin demonstrates significant absorption but limited translocation to the foliage (less than 8 mg per gram of plant tissue) and to the crown (less than 30 mg per gram of plant tissue). This pattern aligns with its logKow value of 3.9, indicating efficient root absorption but restricted xylem movement due to low water solubility. The systemic nature of methiozolin involves moderate acropetal translocation, mainly through the xylem. This indicates that effective field application would likely necessitate exposure to both roots and foliage due to limited translocation efficiency from a singular application site, as evident from the study's results.",
