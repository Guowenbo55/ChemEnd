    "Description": "Methiocarb is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the phenolic group of 3,5-dimethyl-4-(methylsulfanyl)phenol with the carboxy group of methylcarbamic acid. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a molluscicide, an acaricide, an agrochemical, an avicide, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an insecticide. It is a carbamate ester, an aryl sulfide and a methyl sulfide. It is functionally related to a methylcarbamic acid and a 3,5-dimethyl-4-(methylsulfanyl)phenol.",

While the organophosphate insecticides cause irreversible inhibition of the cholinesterase enzymes, the carbamyl-enzyme complex is reversible & dissociates far more readily than the organophosphate complex.

During a 7-month period, 280 dogs and 12 cats were poisoned by metaldehyde (57%) or methiocarb (43%) containing baits with case fatality rates of 8.1% and 9.1% in dogs and 16.7% and 50% in cats, respectively. The ages of poisoned dogs ranged from 2 months to 17 years and cats from 3 months to 5 years. There was no decrease in frequency of poisoning or case fatality rate demonstrated with increasing body size in dogs. Poisoning was most frequent in the month of October. Baits were eaten off the ground or obtained from storage areas, often despite a variety of preventive measures. It is suggested that these products should be reformulated to make them less attractive to domestic pets."
