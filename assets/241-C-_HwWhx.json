    "Description": "Benzene is a six-carbon aromatic annulene in which each carbon atom donates one of its two 2p electrons into a delocalised pi system. A toxic, flammable liquid byproduct of coal distillation, it is used as an industrial solvent. Benzene is a carcinogen that also damages bone marrow and the central nervous system. It has a role as a non-polar solvent, a carcinogenic agent and an environmental contaminant. It is an aromatic annulene, a volatile organic compound and a member of benzenes.",

            "Value": "The protective effects of pyridine and xylene against benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, or cyclophosphamide clastogenicity were studied in mice. Swiss-ICR mice were treated orally with 220 to 880 mg/kg benzene, 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene, or intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide with or without 0 to 500 mg/kg pyridine or xylene. The mice were killed 24 to 72 hours later and the femurs were removed. The bone marrow was isolated and assayed for micronuclei. Xylene inhibited the induction of micronuclei of benzene only when given at an equimolar dose or greater. No delay in the peak micronuclei response was seen. Pyridine at 60 mg/kg completely blocked the induction of micronuclei by 880 mg/kg benzene of 24 hours. Pyridine at 25 mg/kg completely blocked the clastogenic effect of 440 mg/kg benzene at 36 to 76 hours and partially blocked micronuclei induction at 24 hours. The clastogenicity of benzo(a)pyrene was inhibited by pyridine only at doses of 100 mg/kg or more. Pyridine showed no protective effect against micronuclei induction by cyclophosphamide at any concn; micronuclei formation was enhanced by 60 to 260 mg/kg pyridine. Since the results suggested that the biological activation of benzene was due to different cytochrome p450 isozymes than the ones activating benzo(a)pyrene or cyclophosphamide, DBA/2 mice (aryl hydrocarbon hydrolase noninducible) and C57B1/6 mice with or without pretreatment with methylcholanthrene were dosed once or three times with benzene and the effects on bone marrow micronuclei were examined as before. Micronuclei formation was greater in DBA/2 mice. The effect was potentiated by methylcholanthrene. The cytochrome p450 isozyme involved in activating benzene is one of the enzymes induced by methylcholanthrene, independent of the high affinity aryl hydrocarbon hydrolase receptor."

Since it causes important toxic effects in workers exposed to low levels, long-term exposure to this compound has been extensively studied. Leukemia, blood disorders, bone marrow depression, and some types of cancer are directly related to benzene-initiated toxicity. Bioactivation of benzene can lead to the formation of hazardous metabolites such as phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol. Catechol forms semiquinones and reactive quinones that are presumed to play an important role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS formation can directly induce single and double strand breaks in the DNA, oxidized nucleotides, and hyper-recombination, and consequently produces deleterious genetic changes. In this review, we have addressed the cytotoxic effects of benzene and its main metabolite, catechol, focusing on the oxidative pathway and further DNA damage."

Interestingly, benzene-initiated hematotoxicity is absent in mice lacking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) suggesting an imperative role for this receptor in benzene toxicities. This study investigated two potential roles for the AhR in benzene toxicity using hepa 1c1c7 wild type and AhR deficient cells. Considering that many toxic effects of AhR ligands are dependent on AhR activation, our first objective was to determine if benzene, hydroquinone (HQ) or benzoquinone (BQ) could activate the AhR. Secondly, because the AhR regulates a number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress pathways, we sought to determine if the AhR had a role in HQ and BQ induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase assays measuring dioxin response element (DRE) activation showed no significant change in DRE activity after exposure to benzene, HQ or BQ for 24h. Immunofluorescence staining showed cytosolic localization of the AhR after 2h incubations with benzene, HQ or BQ. Western blot analysis of cells exposed to benzene, HQ or BQ for 1, 12 and 24h did not demonstrate induction of CYP1A1 protein expression. Dichlorodihydrofluorescein staining of cells exposed to benzene, HQ or BQ revealed that the presence of the AhR did not affect BQ and HQ induced ROS production. These results indicate that the involvement of the AhR in benzene toxicity does not seem to be through classical activation of this receptor or through interference of oxidative stress pathways."

            "Value": "NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) may perform multiple functions within the cell. It is known to detoxify benzene-derived quinones and generate antioxidant forms of ubiquinone and Vitamin E. Recently suggested roles for NQO1 which may have relevance for mechanisms underlying benzene toxicity include modulation of cellular redox balance, direct scavenging of superoxide, stabilization of p53 and stabilization of microtubules. The NQO1*2 polymorphism is a single nucleotide polymorphism, a C to T change at position 609 of the NQO1 cDNA coding for a proline to serine change at position 187 of the amino acid structure of the protein. The mutant NQO1*2 protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasomal system resulting in a lack of NQO1 protein in individuals carrying the NQO1*2/*2 genotype. The NQO1*2 polymorphism predisposes to benzene toxicity and to various forms of leukemias. NQO1-knockout animals demonstrate myeloid hyperplasia and increased benzene-induced hematotoxicity. NQO1 is not present in freshly isolated human bone marrow hematopoietic cells but can be induced by benzene metabolites. Increases in NQO1 were not observed in NQO1*2/*2 hematopoietic cells, presumably because of the instability of the NQO1*2 protein, suggesting that cells with this genotype would not benefit from any protective effects of NQO1. NQO1 is present in human bone marrow stroma and particularly in endothelial cells. Studies of the functions and distribution of NQO1 in human bone marrow may provide clues to mechanisms underlying benzene toxicity."

            "Value": "Reactive metabolites formed from benzene include benzene oxide, trans,trans muconaldehyde, quinones, thiol adducts, phenolic metabolites and oxygen radicals. Susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene has been suggested to occur partly because of polymorphisms in enzymes involved in benzene metabolism which include cytochrome P450 2E1, epoxide hydrolases, myeloperoxidase, glutathione-S-transferases and quinone reductases. However, susceptibility factors not directly linked to benzene metabolism have also been associated with its toxicity and include p53, proteins involved in DNA repair, genomic stability and expression of cytokines and/or cell adhesion molecules. In this work, /the authors/ examine potential relationships between metabolic and non-metabolic susceptibility factors using the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) as an example. NQO1 may also impact pathways in addition to metabolism of quinones due to protein-protein interactions or other mechanisms related to NQO1 activity. NQO1 has been implicated in stabilizing p53 and in maintaining microtubule integrity. Inhibition or knockdown of NQO1 in bone marrow endothelial cells has been found to lead to deficiencies of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecule expression after TNFalpha stimulation. These examples illustrate how the metabolic susceptibility factor NQO1 may influence non-metabolic susceptibility pathways for benzene toxicity."

The leukocyte suspension and serum were prepared from peripheral blood and utilized for the determination of alkaline phosphatase activity with disodium phenyl phosphate as a substrate (leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and serum assay). While the exposure to benzene at 20 or 50 ppm did not cause significant changes in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity, the exposure at 100 to 300 ppm resulted in a dose-dependent increase of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity up to more than 100% over the control. No further increase was observed at 1000 or 3000 ppm. Similar exposure at 300 ppm to either toluene, m-xylene, n-hexane, trichloroethylene, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, or methyl alcohol did not induce any changes in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity. Thus, the increase in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity was considered to be specific to benzene exposure. When the animals were exposed to toluene (300 ppm) in combination with benzene (300 ppm), not only was the benzene induced leukopenia alleviated as previously reported, but the benzene induced increase in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity was no longer observed. The parallel inhibitory effects of toluene on benzene induced increase in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay and leukopenia suggest that a relation may exist between increase in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay activity and leukopenia. No changes in serum alkaline phosphatase assay activities were observed in the rats under the exposure conditions examined."

Female NQO1-/- mice were more sensitive (6-fold) to benzene-induced genotoxicity than the female NQO1+/+ mice. Female NQO1-/- mice had a 9-fold increase (100 versus 0 ppm) in micronucleated reticulocytes compared with a 3-fold increase in the female NQO1+/+ mice.

Here /the authors/ compared the toxic effects of benzene on mice (C57BL/6 and 129/Sv) homozygous for the wild-type Prkdc allele and mice (129/SvJ) homozygous for a Prkdc functional polymorphism that leads to diminished DNA-PK activity and enhanced apoptosis in response to radiation-induced damage. Male and female mice were exposed to 0, 10, 50, or 100 ppm benzene for 6 hr/d, 5 d/week for 2 weeks. Male mice were more susceptible to benzene toxicity compared with females.

Female mice had smaller but significant increases in micronucleated cells. The p53-dependent response was induced in all strains and genders of mice following benzene exposure, as indicated by an increase in p21 mRNA levels in bone marrow that frequently corresponded with cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Prkdc does not appear to be a significant genetic susceptibility factor for acute benzene toxicity.

Benzoquinone inhibited the broadest range of functions including release of hydrogen peroxide, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon gamma priming for tumor cell cytolysis, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide triggering of cytolysis. Benzoquinone was also the most potent metabolite causing inhibition at lower concentrations than the other metabolites. Hydroquinone inhibited hydrogen peroxide release and priming for cytolysis and 1,2,4-benzenetriol inhibited phagocytosis and priming for cytolysis. Catechol only inhibited the release of hydrogen peroxide. None of the compounds tested inhibited the induction of class II histocompatibililty antigens on the cell surface. All of the effects measured occurred using concentrations of compounds which did not disrupt the cell integrity or inhibit general functions such as protein synthesis. Taken together these data suggest that benzene metabolites alter macrophage function through several mechanisms including inhibition of output enzymes and disruption of signal transduction systems."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ The effects of five straight alkane petroleum hydrocarbons (nC6 to nC10), as well as benzene and toluene upon lysosomal enzymes of the lung were investigated. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages were obtained from adult male Sprague Dawley rats and from 3 month old New-Zealand white rabbits by bronchial lavage. These cells were cultured and subsequently exposed to hydrocarbons in Leighton tubes. All hydrocarbons examined were cytotoxic to cultured pulmonary alveolar macrophages in a dose dependent manner, with benzene and toluene being least toxic. The concentration of hydrocarbon producing death in 50% of treated rat cells was 1.0 millimolar (mM) for nC8, 2.0 mM for nC7, 5 mM for nC9, and about 10 mM for nC6, nC10, benzene and toluene. Concentrations of hydrocarbons that killed 50% of rabbit macrophages were about half those observed in the rat. Cathepsin-D and, to a lesser extent, cathepsin-B release were stimulated upon addition of hydrocarbons to the cell media. A similar but more pronounced release of cathepsins was observed in isolated lysosomes as well. A significant decrease in cell respiration rate and a time and dose dependent increase in lipid peroxidation were also observed following exposure of macrophages to the tested hydrocarbons, particularly nC7 and nC8 alkanes. These results support the concept of an association between chain length and cytotoxicity of hydrocarbons in pulmonary alveolar macrophages."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ When mitochondria are incubated in vitro with 2200 mg/kg of benzene there is an inhibition of RNA synthesis. Benzene also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in vitro in mitoplasts derived from cat and rabbit bone marrow mitochondria. Exogenous NADPH is required for inhibition of mitochondrial RNA synthesis in all these systems which suggests that benzene must be bioactivated within the organelle. Toluene does not inhibit RNA synthesis and the simultaneous addition of equimolar toluene and benzene results in protection against benzene inhibition. Both liver and bone marrow mitochondria incubated (3H) with benzene appear to activate benzene to a metabolite which can covalently bind to guanine residues of DNA. Benzene also inhibits mitochondrial translation."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-related adverse effect that is not exhibited in AhR-knockout (KO) mice. In the hematopoietic system, the steady-state expression of AhRs is limited in the hematopoietic progenitor cells; thus, a hierarchical hematopoietic impairment starts from hematopoietic progenitor cells after benzene exposure. When one looks at wild-type recipient mice that have been lethally irradiated and repopulated with AhR-KO bone marrow cells, owing to reconstruction by the marrow from AhR-KO mice, no impairment is observed in the assay of granulo-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) in the bone marrow after benzene exposure of the reconstituted mice. In contrast, in mature white blood cells concern, benzene-induced hematopoietic cytotoxicity is observed in the same reconstituted mice; however, this benzene-induced hematopoietic cytotoxicity in mature white blood cells is not induced in the case of AhR-KO mice repopulated with wild-type bone marrow cells after a lethal dose of irradiation. The mechanism of benzene-induced hematopoietic toxicity in the mature blood cells in AhR-KO mice is assumed to be based on metabolites such as phenol and hydroquinone derived from hepatic AhR. Thus, the former toxicity in mature white blood cells is assumed to be based on the metabolites of the wild-type hepatic AhR, whereas the latter lack of toxicity in mature blood cells in AhR-KO mice is due to the lack of benzene-induced metabolism in the liver. Global gene expression analysis of bone marrow cells after benzene exposure reveals that MEF2c, the functions of which are known to maintain lymphocyte differentiation and promote proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, is commonly downmodulated not only in C57BL/6 but also in C3H/He mice. In response to these impairments of the hematopoietic progenitor cells and the niches, stochastic and reciprocal upregulations of integrin beta 2 and the Runx family are observed, which are known to stabilize hematopoietic niches during the steady-state. Direct observation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly the Lin(-)c-kit(+)Sca-1(+) (LKS) fraction, after benzene exposure revealed an increased amount of intracytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected by ROS-reacting dye as compared with other blood cell fractions."

In humans, a high percentage of individuals with myeloid and other types of leukemia are homo- and heterozygous for a null mutant allele of NQO1. The NQO2 locus is also highly polymorphic in humans. Recently, /the authors/ generated NQO1-/- and NQO2-/- mice deficient in NQO1 and NQO2 protein and activity, respectively. These mice showed no detectable developmental abnormalities and were indistinguishable from wild type mice. Interestingly, all the mice lacking expression of NQO1 and NQO2 protein demonstrated myelogenous hyperplasia of the bone marrow and increased granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Decreased apoptosis contributed to myelogenous hyperplasia. The studies on short-term exposure of NQO1-/- mice to benzene demonstrated substantially greater benzene-induced toxicity, as compared to wild type mice."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated following benzene exposure, are considered to trigger the development of hematopoietic neoplasms, although little supporting evidence has been found. In this study, /the authors/ examined whether the experimental elimination of ROS generated following benzene exposure prevents the development of benzene-induced hematopoietic disorders to clarify the mechanism underlying the development of benzene-induced hematopoietic disorders. C57BL/6 mice, overexpressing human thioredoxin (h-Trx-Tg), were used to examine the possible nullification of ROS induction following benzene exposure. The experimental group was exposed to 300 ppm benzene 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 26 weeks, and lifetime observation followed by molecular and histopathological examinations were carried out.The present study using h-Trx-Tg mice showed a complete suppression of the development of thymic lymphoma induced by benzene inhalation (0% in h-Trx-Tg vs 30% in wild-type (Wt) mice). This was associated with a 48% decrease in the incidence of clastogenic micronucleated reticulocyte induction in the h-Trx-Tg mice compared with the Wt control after 2 weeks of inhalation. As underlying mechanisms, the attenuation of oxidative stress was accompanied by a complete abrogation of hemato-lymphoid toxicity, as shown by the upregulation of the activity of superoxide-dismutase, and a consequently stable ROS level, as determined by cell sorting using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, along with a significant attenuation of the overexpression of a cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. The attenuation of benzene-induced oxidative stress and that of the consequent lymphomagenesis were observed for the first time, and these indicate a role of oxidative stress in benzene-induced clastogenesis and lymphomagenesis. (These attenuations were not seen in nonthymic lymphomas, and no leukemias developed in C57BL/6 used in this study.) During the constitutive overexpression of h-Trx, the expression of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor in h-Trx-Tg mice was downregulated, which may also contribute to the attenuation."
