    "Description": "Chlorotoluron is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by two methyl groups while the other is substituted by a 3-chloro-4-methylphenyl group. A herbicide that is non-toxic to honeybees but moderately toxic to mammals, birds, earthworms and most aquatic organisms. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, an agrochemical and a herbicide. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes and a member of phenylureas.",

            "Value": "Degradation of chlortoluron proceeds through the cleavage of the C-N bond as demonstrated using both soil and microbial culture studies(1). Chlortoluron had a half-life in soil of 4-6 weeks(2). The only metabolite identified in this study was monomethyl chlortoluron(2). A half-life of between 6-18 weeks was reported for chlortoluron(3). In biometer experiments, half-lives of 93 days and 40 days were measured for chlortoluron in a silty sand and silty loam soil, respectively(4). However, the disappearance of this compound in an outdoor lysimeter experiment was slower in silty loam (49 days, fallow land; 38 days, barley field) than in silty sand(52 days, fallow land; 14 days, barley field)(4). The main metabolite of chlortoluron degradation was N-dimethylated chlortoluron(4). Chlortoluron, applied as either a suspendible concentrate or wettable powder, had a calculated half-life of 96 days for both conditions in one soil (pH 5.1; organic carbon 4.1%; silt 16%; water holding capacity 27%); a second soil (pH 7.0; organic carbon 1.6%; silt 11% water holding capacity 16.6%) had calculated half-lives of 82 and 84 days for a suspendible concentrate and wettable powder, respectively(5)."

            "Value": "Chlortoluron at 5 and 100 umol/kg soil was incubated at 25 \u00b0C in both a sandy loam and a mucky peat(1). Degradation was slow and there was no indication of a lag phase. The percentage of total applied 14C activity evolved as 14CO2 from the soil varied from 0.21 to 0.14% in peat and sand, respectively, at the 5 umol/kg soil herbicide concentration and from 0.25 to 0.38% in peat and sand, respectively, at the 100 umol/kg soil herbicide concentration(1). The higher rate for the sandy soil at 100 umol/kg soil concentration was believed due to the protective effect of sorption (in the peat soil) on the degradation process(1). A half-life of chlortoluron in soil was estimated at 25 \u00b0C as 2306 and 4730 days for peat and sand soils, respectively, at a herbicide concentration of 5 umol/kg soil(1). A half-life of 1949 and 1335 days for peat and sand soils, respectively, was estimated for a herbicide concentration of 100 umol/kg soil(1). These half-lives were derived from the rate of 14CO2 production under laboratory conditions(1)."
