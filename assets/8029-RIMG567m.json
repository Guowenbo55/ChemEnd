            "Value": "Furan administered by gavage for 2 yr has been reported to induce hepatocellular carcinomas in male and female B6C3F1 mice and in male but not female F344 rats. Chronic exposure studies ...  using bioassay conditions showed extensive hepatocellular toxicity and sustained increases in regenerative cell proliferation after 1, 3, and 6 wk of treatment in male and female rats and male mice. Altered expression of growth-control genes associated with this hyperproliferative state may enhance the susceptibility of these genes to mutation or may provide a selective growth advantage to preneoplastic cells. Quantitative northern blot analysis of mRNA was used to examine the expression of the oncogenes myc, fos, and Ha-ras in the livers of animals treated with furan. In male rats, a single administration of 30 mg/kg furan produced necrosis and a subsequent wave of cell proliferation 48 hr after treatment and induced transient peaks in the expression of myc, fos, and Ha-ras 6-24 hr after treatment. In male rat liver from our cell proliferation studies, only a slight increase in myc expression was seen at the end of week 1 of treatment. However, beginning at week 3 and increasing at week 6, up to a 15-fold increase over control values was observed in the expression of myc in the treated animals. The only other notable increase in expression observed in any animals from the cell proliferation study was a threefold increase in myc at week 6 in treated female rats. The absence of an increase in Ha-ras expression in the male mouse liver suggests that the unique pattern of Ha-ras mutations previously reported in furan-induced mouse liver tumors is not due to increased mutational susceptibility related to overexpression of this gene. The lack of sustained expression of myc, fos, and Ha-ras in rapidly proliferating liver suggests that continuous expression of these genes is not necessary to maintain increased rates of cell replication. The large increase in myc expression in male but not female rats suggests an adaptive change that may be related to the sex-specific incidence of furan-induced hepatocellular carcinomas in rats."

Sodium-salicylate, a known nephrotoxic, at 375 mg/kg and 3-methylthiopene, with no discernible nephrotoxic effects, at 500 mg/kg were given to similar mice. Results for each treated group were compared with an untreated group. Urine was collected for 24 hours after dosing and urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase was determined through absorbance of the p-nitrophenolate ion. Enzyme activity was expressed in units, representing 1 nanomole of substrate hydrolyzed per hour. Urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase was not affected by 3-methylthiopene and was increased by sodium-salicylate from 204 N-acetylglucosaminidase units to 428 N-acetylglucosaminidase units. All the furans caused a decrease in urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase. For furan, N-acetylglucosaminidase was 357 units for controls and 234 units for treated animals. Animals given 3-ethylfuran had urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase of 240 units. Those given 3-pentylfuran had 233 N-acetylglucosaminidase units in urine. Urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase was clearly dose related in animals given 2-ethylfuran. At 25 mg/kg N-acetylglucosaminidase was 187 units. At 50 mg/kg it dropped to 157 units. At 100 mg/kg it was only 60 units. The authors conclude that nephrotoxicity is associated with decreases in urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase although the mechanism is unclear."

Furan produced dose-dependent increases in state 4 respiration and ATPase activity. Both of these changes were prevented by 1-phenylimidazole cotreatment. In a separate series of experiments, mitochondria were prepared from isolated rat hepatocytes following incubation with furan (2-100 uM) for 1-4 hr. Furan produced incubation time- and concentration-dependent increases in state 4 respiration and ATPase activity. Furan-mediated mitochondrial changes were prevented by adding 1-phenylimidazole to the hepatocyte suspensions. These results indicate that the ene-dialdehyde metabolite of furan uncouples hepatic oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. In vitro studies using an isolated hepatocyte suspension/culture system demonstrated that the concentration response for furan-mediated mitochondrial changes in suspension corresponded with the concentration responses for cell death after 24 hr. Including 1-phenylimidazole or oligomycin plus fructose in hepatocyte suspensions prevented furan-induced cell death after 24 hr in culture. The results of this study indicate that furan-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is an early, critical event in cytolethality both in vivo and in vitro."

A one-month recovery group previously treated for three months was also included. There was a marked association between CYP2E1 expression and DNA oxidation (8-oxo-dG) in areas of centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis seen after a single dose. After one-month recovery from three-month treatment, 8-oxo-dG was still observed in areas of furan-induced cholangiofibrosis. Furan-induced changes in the expression of various genes associated with oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell cycle control were identified during treatment and recovery. /It was proposed/ that furan-induced cholangiocarcinomas emerge from areas of cholangiofibrosis as a result of a combination of chronic, persistent indirect damage to DNA through oxygen radicals coupled with persistent proliferative signals, including loss of connexin 32, that act to convert this DNA damage to fixed mutations."

The administration of furan caused centrilobular injury, and restoration was accomplished by proliferation of hepatocytes. Some areas of the liver were, however, more severely affected, and here, injury extended into portal and capsular areas, which resulted in a rapid proliferation of ductular cells that extended into the parenchyma accompanied by a subtype of liver fibroblasts. These ductules either differentiated into hepatocytes, with loss of the associated fibroblasts, or progressed to form tortuous ductular structures that replaced much of the parenchyma, leading to cholangiofibrosis. Although it is unclear what determines the difference in the hepatic response, a loss of micro-environmental cues that instigate hepatocyte differentiation and termination of the hepatocyte stem cell repair response may be perturbed by continual furan administration that results in an irreversible expansile lesion that may mimic the features of cholangiocarcinoma."

Specifically, metaplastic small intestinal-like glands closely resembling in their cellular composition the crypts of Lieberkuhn of normal rat small intestine were selectively derived from putative hyperplastic bile ductule-like progenitor structures in the right and caudate liver lobes of young adult Fischer-344 male rats given furan by gavage at a daily dose of 30-45 mg/kg bw, 5 times weekly, over a 2-6 week treatment period. Longer term chronic administration of furan at 30 mg/kg/day for 9-19 wk resulted in the preferential development of primary hepatic adenocarcinomas, which arose at 70-100% incidences from right/caudate liver lobes and which were characterized by small intestine mucosal cell differentiation. Interestingly, the neoplastic glands of these \"intestinal-type\" hapatic tumors demonstrated strongly positive immunochemical reactions for both hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and its c-met encoded receptor and were immunohistochemically positive for transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and for mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor, implicated in the activation of latent TGF-beta 1. In contrast, a different pattern of aberrant bile ductular cell differentiation was noted to occur in the atrophied right liver lobe of moribund Fischer-344 male rats that were chronically exposed over a 10-14-day period to a severely hepatotoxic dose of furan (60 mg/kg/day). Under this latter experimental condition, rare yet distinct cholangiolar-like structures composed of biliary epithelial cells and typically a single ductular hepatocytic cell in various stages of maturation specifically formed in association with an extensive hyperplastic bile ductular reaction. Very similar cholangiolar-like structures also appeared in areas of preexisting hyperplastic bile ductule tissue at 3-5 days following the administration of a single hepatonecrogenic dose of CCl4 to rats that 4-6 wk earlier had been subjected to a bile duct ligation. In addition, a novel rat model was developed in which furan combined in a unique synergistic manner with bile duct ligation to induce the replacement of almost all of liver with well-differentiated hyperplastic bile ductules without evidence of differentiation along either metaplastic small intestine mucosal cell or ductular hepatocyte lineages. Bile ductular epithelial cell isolated from bile duct-ligated/furan-treated rats were further observed to be organized in the form of bile duct-like structures in vitro under specific conditions of primary cell culture and in vivo following their cell transplantation into the inguinal fat pads of sygeneic recipient rats."

Offspring transplacentally exposed to an initiating dose of a carcinogen typically do not produce any skin tumors in the absence of postnatal treatment; many skin tumors appear only when they are treated with tumor promoting agents postnatally. Tumor promoting agents alone produce no skin tumors or only a few. Thus, two stages of carcinogenesis, initiation and promotion, can be conveniently separated. Our results indicate that fetal c-Ha-ras can be transplacentally activated through a specific point mutation by a carcinogen. However, since postnatal promotion was essential for the production of tumors, they also suggest that a cell harboring such a mutation may remain dormant until it encounters a tumor promoting stimulus.

The induction of primary DNA damage in splenocytes was evaluated by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and by the immunofluorescence detection of foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX). The presence of cross-links was probed in a modified comet assay, in which cells were irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays before electrophoresis. Chromosome damage was quantitated through the detection of micronuclei in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes using the cytokinesis-block method. Micronucleus induction was also assessed with a modified protocol, using the repair inhibitor 1-beta-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine to convert single-strand breaks in micronuclei. The results obtained show a significant (P < 0.01) increase of gamma-H2AX foci in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes of mice treated with 8 and 15 mg furan/kg bw and a statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases of micronuclei in binucleated splenocytes cultured in vitro. Conversely, no effect of in vivo exposure to furan was observed when freshly isolated quiescent splenocytes were analysed by immunofluorescence and in comet assays, both with standard and radiation-modified protocols. These results indicate that the in vivo exposure to furan gives rise to pre-mutagenic DNA damage in resting splenocytes, which remains undetectable until it is converted in frank lesions during the S-phase upon mitogen stimulation. The resulting DNA strand breaks are visualized by the increase in gamma-H2AX foci and may originate micronuclei at the subsequent mitosis."

Twenty-four hours after last administration, animals were sacrificed, liver was excised and the following parameters were evaluated: histological alterations, apoptosis, cell proliferation, polyploidy, overall DNA methylation, gene expression and DNA damage by the immunofluorescence detection of foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and by alkaline comet assays, using both standard and modified protocols for the detection of DNA cross links. Liver DNA damage by comet assays was also evaluated in mice receiving furan as a single acute oral dose (15, 100 or 250 mg/kg bw). Microscopic analysis of liver sections indicated that repeated oral administration of furan was moderately toxic, producing mild histological alterations with necrotic figures, apoptosis and limited regenerative cell proliferation. The flow cytometric analysis of DNA content in single-cell suspensions of liver cells showed a statistically significant increase in polyploid (8N) cells at the highest dose. No treatment-related changes in overall DNA methylation, gamma-H2AX foci, DNA strand breaks and cross links were observed at the end of the 4-week exposure period. However, several genes involved in DNA damage response, beyond stress and liver toxicity, were over-expressed in mice treated with the highest furan dose (15 mg/kg bw/day). Acute administration of furan induced evident liver toxicity at the highest dose (250 mg/kg bw), which was associated with a significant increase of DNA damage in the alkaline comet assay and with a distinct decrease in gamma-ray-induced DNA migration. Overall, the results obtained suggest that the contribution of genotoxicity to the mechanism of furan carcinogenicity in mouse liver should not be dismissed."

Analysis of three fully independent replicates with a linear mixed-effects model showed a highly significant increase with concentration for both endpoints. Compared to methyl methanesulfonate used as a positive control, BDA was of similar potency with respect to genotoxicity, but it was much more cytotoxic. Furan added to cell cultures at doses that resulted in time-averaged effective concentrations of up to 3100 uM was neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic. A potential cross-linking activity of BDA was investigated by checking whether gamma radiation-induced DNA migration in the comet assay could be reduced by pre-treatment with BDA. In contrast to the effect of the positive control glutaraldehyde, BDA treatment did not reduce the comet tail length. On the contrary, an increase was observed at greater than or equal to 100 uM BDA, which was attributable to early apoptotic cells. Although BDA was found to be a relatively potent genotoxic agent in terms of the concentration necessary to double the background measures, cytotoxicity strongly limited the concentration range that produced interpretable results. This may explain some of the inconclusive results and indicates that non-genotoxic effects must be taken into account in the discussion of the modes of toxic and carcinogenic action of furan."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ Furan is a hepatic toxicant and carcinogen in rodents. Its microsomal metabolite, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial, is mutagenic in the Ames assay. Consistent with this observation, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial reacts with 2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, and 2'-deoxyadenosine to form diastereomeric adducts. HPLC analysis indicated that the rate of reaction with deoxyribonucleosides was dependent on pH. At pH 6.5, the relative reactivity was 2'-deoxycytidine > 2'-deoxyguanosine > 2'-deoxyadenosine whereas it was 2'-deoxyguanosine > 2'-deoxycytidine > 2'-deoxyadenosine at pH 8.0. Thymidine did not react with cis-2-butene-1,4-dial. The primary 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine reaction products were unstable and decomposed to secondary products. NMR and mass spectral analysis indicated that the initial 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine reaction products were hemiacetal forms of 3-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-erthyropentafuranosyl)-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-hydroxy-7-(ethane-2''-al)-9H-imidazo[1,2-alpha]purine-9-one (structure 2) and 3-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-erythropentafuranosyl)-3,6,7,8-tetrahydro-7-(ethane-2''-al)-8-hydroxy-3H-imidazo[2,1-i]purine (structure 4), respectively. These adducts resulted from the addition of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial to the exo- and endocyclic nitrogens of 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine. The data provide support for the hypothesis that cis-2-butene-1,4-dial is an important genotoxic intermediate in furan-induced carcinogenesis."

Since furan itself did not significantly react with GSH, these data indicate the formation of a reactive metabolite of furan in hepatocyte suspensions. Treatment of the hepatocyte suspensions with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor 1-phenylimidazole delayed GSH depletion but did not alter furan induced (4-12 mM) cytolethality. The furan concentrations required to produce measurable hepatocyte lethality in vitro within 6 hr (4-12 mM) were several orders of magnitude greater than the predicted maximal liver concentrations of furan in vivo following hepatotoxic doses. In order to study the mechanisms involved in the cytolethality of furan toward hepatocytes in vitro at concentrations relevant to hepatotoxicity in vivo, a hepatocyte suspension culture system was developed that utilized furan concentrations and incubation times similar to hepatic dosimetry in vivo. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes ... were incubated with furan (2-100 uM) for 1-4 hr and placed into culture, and viability was determined after 24 hr by lactate dehydrogenase release. Furan produced cytolethality (5-70%) and modest GSH depletion in an incubation time and concentration dependent manner. Both GSH depletion and cytolethality induced by furan were prevented by 1-phenylimidazole and enhanced by acetone pretreatment in rats. /The results indicate/ that oxidation of furan by cytochrome P450 is required for GSH depletion and cytolethality, indicating that a reactive metabolite is involved in cell death. ..."
