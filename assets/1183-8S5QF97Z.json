Since an external metabolic activation system was able to convert anti-mutagens into co-mutagens, we studied whether the different metabolism of yeast and mice would lead to different effects. In whole-animal experiments using the mouse spot test, anti-mutagenic effects of vanillin ... have been observed. In our present experiments with yeast, tannic acid and phenobarbital showed anti-mutagenic effects also, whereas vanillin acted as a co-mutagen.

The effects of vanillin on H2O2-induced chromosome aberrations were also examined. Vanillin had a dose-dependent enhancing effect on EMS-induced cytotoxicity and 6TG-resistant mutations, when cells were simultaneously treated with vanillin. The post-treatment with vanillin during the mutation expression time of cells after treatment with EMS also showed an enhancement of the frequency of mutations induced by EMS. However, vanillin suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by H2O2 when cells were post-treated with vanillin after H2O2 treatment. Vanillin showed no change in the absence of activity of H2O2 to induce mutations. Post-treatment with vanillin also suppressed the chromosome aberrations induced by H2O2. The differential effects of vanillin were probably due to the quality of mutagen-induced DNA lesions and vanillin might influence at least two different kinds of cellular repair functions. The mechanisms by which vanillin enhances or suppresses chemical-induced cytotoxicity, mutations and chromosome aberrations are discussed."

The most resistant mould to the conditions studied was A. niger, followed by A. parasiticus, A. flavus and A. ochraceus. For each mould the increase in vanillin concentration and the type of fruit used in agar preparation significantly (P < 0.05) affected the radial growth rate. The vanillin inhibitory concentrations were in general lower than 2000 ppm. The inoculated moulds grew faster and in higher vanillin concentrations on mango and banana fruit-based agars.

It has also been suggested to have antifungal activity against major human pathogenic fungi, although it is not very effective. In this study, the antifungal activities of vanillin and 33 vanillin derivatives against the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, the main pathogen of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients, were investigated. We found a structural correlation between the vanillin derivatives and antifungal activity, showing that the hydroxyl or alkoxy group is more advantageous than the halogenated or nitrated group in benzaldehyde. Among the vanillin derivatives with a hydroxyl or alkoxy group, o-vanillin and o-ethyl vanillin showed the highest antifungal activity against C. neoformans. o-Vanillin was further studied to understand the mechanism of antifungal action. We compared the transcriptome of C. neoformans cells untreated or treated with o-vanillin by using RNA sequencing and found that the compound caused mitochondrial dysfunction and triggered oxidative stress. These antifungal mechanisms of o-vanillin were experimentally confirmed by the significantly reduced growth of the mutants lacking the genes involved in mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress response."
