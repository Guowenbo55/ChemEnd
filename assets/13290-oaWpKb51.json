Similar behavior has been shown for the methoxy & methylthio-s-triazines. It has been reported that the s-triazines affect the tricarboxylic acid cycle with activation of phospho-phenyl pyruvate-carboxylase causing the disappearance of sucrose & glyceric acid with the formation of aspartic & malic acids. /s-Triazines/"

Based upon this estimated Koc, methoprotryne will be expected to exhibit medium mobility in soil(5). Evidence has been reported which indicates that the basicity of s-triazine herbicides, such as methoprotryne, is not the main factor governing adsorption to soil humic acids(1). It has been shown that the ability of s-triazines herbicides to act as electron donors to electron acceptor quinone-like units of humic acids also plays an important role in the adsorption(2)."
