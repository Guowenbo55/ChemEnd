Depuration was rapid, with >96% of the accumulated residues eliminated from the fish tissues by day 3 of the depuration period. A BCF of 3.2 was measured in fathead minnow(2). A log BCF of 0.35242 in bluegill sunfish exposed for 28 days has also been reported(3), corresponding to a BCF of 2.20(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. ["

            "Value": "Bromacil is very mobile in sand, sandy loam, clay loam and silt loam soils; aged bromacil residues are very mobile in silt loam soils(1). Extensive data exists as evidence that bromacil leaches to ground water as a result of normal agricultural use(1). An average Koc value of 23 was determined from experimental values determined in 8 soils and 4 sediments(2). Koc values of 25 to 50 for for Israeli soils(3), 55 to 126(4), 46 to 93 for 7 sandy Florida soils(5), and 76 to 129 for a mucky peat and a loamy sand Oregon soils incubated at temperatures of 4 and 25 \u00b0C(6) have been reported. Koc values in sand (FL), sandy loam (CA), clay loam (MD), and silt loam (DE) were 12, 33, 2.3, and 14, respectively(7). According to a classification scheme(8), these Koc values suggest that bromacil is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil. In soil column leaching studies, bromacil readily leached from loess and sandy soils, but was retained in organic-rich soils(6). As the pH increased from 3 to 12, less adsorption of bromacil to Ca-montmorillonite was measured(4). In 7 sandy soils, a rainfall of 20-23 cm displaced over 96% of applied bromacil(5). Koc values were slightly higher at lower temperatures(6). Maximum bromacil concentrations of 1.25 ppm were detected in groundwater (depths of 4.5-6 meters) three months after the herbicide was applied to a surface of Lakeland, FL sandy soil bearing scrub vegetation of small oaks and poor grasses(9). The pKa of bromacil is 9.30(10), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(11). Desorption of bromacil from Cuban soils were reported as 51.98 and 67.00% from a red ferralitic soil and a brown plastic soil, respectively; the specific adsorption constants are 2.89 and 23.9 ug/g, respectively(12). Adsorption coefficients 1.79 and 4.59 for Motupiko topsoil (1-10 cm) and subsoil (40-50 cm), respectively, and 1.57 for Waikiwi topsoil (1-10 cm) have been reported for two Wakefield, Nelson, New Zealand soils. Soil characteristics are as follows: Motupiko silt loam (pH 5.7, 24% sand, 57% silt, 19% clay, 2.4% organic content) Waikiwi silt loam (pH 5.5, 7% sand, 69% silt, 24% clay, 3.9% organic content)(13)."

                "Plant Grown Condition": "Plants were grown in a growth chamber at 20\u00b0C with a light intensity of 60-70 W m-2 for 16 hours light and 8 hours dark, and a humidity of about 50%.",
                "Chemical Preparation": "Herbicides asulam and bromacil were used.A stock solution of [14C]bromacil (sp act 0.858 mCi/mmol) and a radiochemical purity of more than 99% was prepared in 98% ethyl alcohol. Twenty microliters of this solution containing 0.1 \u03bcCi was added to each ampoule with a final concentration of 3.1 x 10-6 M in 30 ml.",
                "Details for the Plant": "Seedlings of 10 to 12 days of maize and bean were transferred to dark-colored glass ampoules containing Hoagland solution and 14C-labeled asulam or bromacil. The concentrations of the herbicides were 2.9 x 10-6 M for asulam and 3.1 x 10-6 M for bromacil.",
                "Other Information": "The experiments were made in triplicate."
