The NRK-52E line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and the NK-4 line was established by us from male F344/NCr rats. The NRK-52E line was co-cultured on a confluent monolayer of lethally irradiated NRK-52E cells to determine colony-forming ability (cloning efficiency) and clonal expansion (average surface area of the colonies SA) and the NK-4 line was cultured on collagen gel. Streptozotocin, a renal carcinogen, and trisodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate, a renal carcinogen and tumor promoter, showed mild growth-enhancing effects on both cell lines, as determined by significant increases in SA, but not in cloning efficiency (CE). Sodium barbital, a renal tumor promoter, had similar effects, while phenobarbital sodium, a non-renal tumor promoter, lacked such activity. The effects of these compounds on gap junctional function were investigated by the Lucifer Yellow dye transfer microinjection assay using monolayers of NRK-52E and NK-4 cells. We found that streptozotocin, trisodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate and sodium barbital inhibited IC in NRK-52E cells, in accordance with their reported tumorigenic and/or tumor-promoting activity in vivo, while phenobarbital sodium did not. Thus, we could present these findings in NRK-52E cells as an in vitro model to examine the potential tissue-specific effects of renal carcinogens and tumor promoters in vitro. We found, however, that other growth control mechanisms beside IC may play a role, because although the NK-4 line did not possess normal IC, the tumor promoters studied had identical growth-promoting effects on colony formation and expansion in both this cell line and the NRK-52E line."
