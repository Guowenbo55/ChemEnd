Over a 20-day period, no biodegradation of 200 ppm 1-naphthylamine as a sole carbon source was observed in a batch system containing an adapted activated sludge(3). 1-Naphthylamine at 500 ppm was found to inhibit oxygen uptake in a Warburg respirometer containing a municipal activated sludge(4). At 1000 ppm, 1-naphthylamine was toxic to an activated sludge(5). 1-Naphthylamine degradation in six different soils after 308 days of incubation at 23 \u00b0C varied from 16.6-30.7% as measured by radio-labelled carbon dioxide evolution(6). Comparison of carbon dioxide evolution in sterilized (via gamma radiation) versus unsterilized soil suggested that the degradation was predominantly microbial in nature(6). Approximately 16, 28 and 33% of added 1-naphthylamine degraded in Russell soil at temperatures of 12, 23 and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, indicating the effect of temperature on microbial degradation(6)."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 1-naphthylamine is expected to have low mobility in soil. Results of a batch equilibrium study with various soils indicated that 1-naphthylamine binds to soil in two phases with an initial rapid and reversible equilibrium established between the amine and the inorganic and organic components of soil followed subsequently by a strong association with the humic fraction of soil via covalent binding(3,4). In laboratory study, 1-naphthyalmine was found to have a relatively moderate tendency to adsorb to lignite coal in subsurface areas where it may be present as a contaminant from coal-gasification plants(5)."
