    "Description": "Cyprodinil is a member of the class of aminopyrimidine that is N-phenylpyrimidin-2-amine carrying additional cyclopropyl and methyl substituents at positions 4 and 6 respectively. A broad spectrum fungicide used to control a range of pathogens including Tapesia yallundae, Botrytis spp., Alternaria spp. and Rhynchospium secalis. Whilst it is a recognised irritant no serious human health concerns have been identified. It is moderately toxic to birds as well as most aquatic organisms and earthworms, but it is not considered toxic to honeybees. It has a role as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aminopyrimidine, a secondary amino compound, a member of cyclopropanes and an anilinopyrimidine fungicide.",

To enhance the chemical control of BRRD and prevent the emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study examined the control efficacy and systemic activity of fungicides with various modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with different modes of action were tested for their inhibitory effects on 39 P. noxius isolates from multiple regions. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (target-site G1) exhibited colony growth inhibition of P. noxius by 99.9% to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7% to 99.8% at 1 ppm. Another effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings, with cyproconazole and tebuconazole being the most efficiently absorbed by roots and transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments indicated that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD compared to mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Since all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered over trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.",
