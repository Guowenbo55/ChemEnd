    "Description": "Amitrole is a member of the class of triazoles that is 1H-1,2,4-triazole substituted by an amino group at position 3. Used to control annual grasses and aquatic weeds (but not on food crops because it causes cancer in laboratory animals). Its use within the EU was banned from September 2017 on the grounds of potential groundwater contamination and risks to aquatic life; there have also been concerns about its endocrine-disrupting properties. It has a role as a herbicide, an EC 1.11.1.6 (catalase) inhibitor and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is an aromatic amine and a member of triazoles.",

            "Value": "Interference with histidine metabolism, inhibition of pigment biosynthesis, or both have been the principal candidates for the primary site of action of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole). Arabidopsis thaliana is sensitive to 1,2,4-triazole-3-alanine, a feedback inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, and this effect is reversed by histidine. The combination of triazolealanine and histidine, however, does not reverse the herbicical effect of amitrole. This indicates that amitrole toxicity is not caused by histidine starvation, nor is it caused by the accumulation of a toxic intermediate of the histidine pathway. Amitrole inhibits root elongation at lower concentrations than it causes pigment bleaching in the leaves. In contrast, fluridone, a known inhibitor of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway does not block root elongation. Fluridone also inhibits carotenoid accumulation in etiolated seedlings in the dark, but amitrole does not. Last, gabaculine and acifluorfen, but not amitrole, prevent chlorophyll accumulation in greeting etiolated seedlings of Arabidopsis. ..."

            "Value": "Amitrole has been found to be an inhibitor of thyroid iodide peroxidase ... both in vitro and in vivo. Histochemical studies confirmed the reduction of thyroid peroxidase activity during amitrole treatment ... Thyroid iodide peroxidase is thought to catalyse both thyroglobulin iodination and tyrosine (3-monoiodotyrosine and 3,5-diiodotyrosine) coupling, which leads to the formation of the thyroid hormones 3,3,3',5'-tetraiodo-thyronine (T4) and 3,5,3' triiodothyronine (T3). The influence of amitrole on these peroxidase-catalysed reactions was also demonstrated by the relative depletion of T4 in the thyroid of rats treated with amitrole, compared with the levels of tyrosines. These results suggest that amitrole affects both reactions catalysed by thyroid peroxidase. However, the nature of the mechanism involved in this reduction of peroxidase activity remains unclear."

In both species, absorption was greatest in the apical region of the root. Absorption by the apical region of wheat roots was more than three times greater than the basal portions, and more than twice as great as the apical region of oat roots. Less than 5% of the absorbed diclofop-methyl was translocated in both wheat and oat roots. Diclofop-methyl and diclofop(2-[4(2',4'-dichlorophenoxy)phenoxy]propanoic acid) were the predominant translocated forms. The absorption and translocation of amitrole (3-amino-l,2,4-triazole) were also examined. Amitrole was absorbed along the entire length of wheat roots and translocated primarily in the basipetal direction.
