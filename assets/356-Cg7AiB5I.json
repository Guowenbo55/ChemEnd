            "Value": "The degradation of n-alkanes by microorganisms is similar to the degradation of fatty acids. The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes, although it does occur in longer chain alkanes also. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having very different rates of activity. The different chain lengths of n-alkanes are degraded to different extents ... At chain lengths greater than C6 the degradability generally increases until about C11-C12. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxygenase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes ... /but/ cells grown on C4-C8 alkanes did not oxidize the shorter chain alkanes to a significant extent. ... /n-Alkanes/"
