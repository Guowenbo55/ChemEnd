    "Description": "Cyflufenamid is a member of the class of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes that is 2,3-difluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzenecarboxamidine in which the hydrogen attached to the imino nitrogen is replaced by a cyclopropylmethoxy group while one of the hydrogens attached to the other nitrogen is replaced by a phenylacetyl group. It is used as a fungicide for the control of powdery mildew in cereal crops as well as in apple and pear orchards. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a carboxamidine, an oxime O-ether, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, a difluorobenzene and an amide fungicide.",

For translocative activity, cyflufenamid scarcely showed any activity against cucumber powdery mildew when evaluated using a root dipping method even at 50 ppm, whereas triadimefon showed excellent translocative activity at 3.1 ppm.",

Disease severity in the field was evaluated on Oct. 3, 10, 17, and 25 using a disease rating scale from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 4 (severe disease). The evaluation of fungicidal activity involved determining the area of visible lesions, expressed as the percentage of diseased leaf area ranging from 0-100%. The control value (CV) was calculated using the following equation: CV = (1 - T/C) x 100 Where T represents the percentage of diseased leaf area in treated seedlings and C represents the percentage in non-treated seedlings.",
