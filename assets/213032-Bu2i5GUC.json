The results showed that both fungicides mainly accumulated in the tomato roots with limited translocation to the upper parts of the plant. Root absorption and inhibitor studies indicated the dominance of apoplastic and symplastic pathways in the uptake of oxathiapiprolin and famoxadone by the tomato roots, respectively. The uptake process for both fungicides followed passive and aquaporin-dependent transport mechanisms. In terms of storage, insoluble cell components such as cell organelles and walls were the dominant compartments for both fungicides. In the protoplast, oxathiapiprolin had a higher proportion in the soluble fraction compared to famoxadone. Overall, the study provides a detailed understanding of the transfer of oxathiapiprolin and famoxadone from the environment to tomato plants, which can be useful for predicting their uptake and distribution.",
