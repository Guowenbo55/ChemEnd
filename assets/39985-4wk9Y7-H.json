Beauv.], a susceptible grass; proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), a moderately susceptible grass; longspine sandbur [Cenchrus longispinus (Hack.) Fern.], a tolerant grass; and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. \u2018Hark\u2019] and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. \u2018Green Star\u2019), both tolerant broadleaf plants. On a jug/plant basis, the order of diclofop-methyl spray retention was cucumber > soybean > proso millet > longspine sandbur = barnyardgrass. On a \u03bcg/mg dry weight basis, proso millet retained 3 to 10 times more diclofop-methyl than all other species. One day after treatment (DAT), absorption of 14C-diclofopmethyl was 14 to 18% less in longspine sandbur than in the other species, 3 DAT absorption in cucumber was 8 to 14% greater than in the other species, and 5 DAT absorption in soybean was 3 to 12% less than in other species. Translocation of 14C-diclofop-methyl did not differ among species, with 98% of the applied radioactivity located in the treated leaf. An average of 11% of radioactivity applied to the surface of intact, living plants and excised, dried leaves of cucumber, soybean, and barnyardgrass, as well as glass cover slips, was lost by evaporation. None of the parameters measured showed differences large enough to be implicated as primary selectivity mechanisms.",

More radioactivity was recovered in the treatment zone after 14C-diclofop-methyl applications, alone or in combination, than after similar 14C-diclofop treatments in oat and soybean. Basipetal movement of radioactivity was 4 and 1% and acropetal movement was 1 and 4% in oat and soybean, respectively, regardless of the diphenyl ether treatment or time. Addition of 2,4-D or bentazon did not reduce translocation of radioactivity from 14C-diclofop-methyl treatments in either plant species. Basipetal movement of radioactivity from 14C-diclofop-methyl was greater than from 14C-diclofop in both oat and soybean. The addition of diclofop-methyl or diclofop did not affect the pattern or amount of 14C-2,4-D radioactivity translocated. In oats, radioactivity appeared to accumulate within the intercalary meristematic region with 14C-2,4-D and 14C-diphenyl-ether applications. Diclofop-methyl at 1 kg/ha applied either to an entire oat plant at the three-leaf stage or the apical meristemic region resulted in plant mortality.
