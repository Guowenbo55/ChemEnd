    "Description": "L-aspartic acid is the L-enantiomer of aspartic acid. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a neurotransmitter. It is an aspartate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, an aspartic acid and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a L-aspartate(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-aspartic acid.",

After 5 days, 48.5%(1) 38.7(2) and 80.5%(3) of the theoretical BOD was reached using a sewage inoculum. L-Aspartic acid was degraded by 81% BODT after 30 days using a sewage inoculum(4). In a second Warburg test using an activated sludge inoculum, 8.9, 16.2, and 28.8% BODT was reached after 0.25, 0.5, and 1 day, respectively(5). DL-Aspartic acid was rapidly degraded by 98 to >99% in a laboratory-scale activated sludge unit at initial concentrations of 599, 1198, 2396, and 4792 mg/L and average detention times of 20.5, 29, 42, and 85 hours, respectively(6). Samples of marine water from the Scheldt estuary, the Belgian coastal zone of the North Sea, and the English Channel were incubated with 14C-labeled DL-aspartic acid and relative rates of total utilization (incorporation plus respiration) of 2.7, 1.5, and 0.10%/hr, respectively, were measured over a 4-hour period(7). Based on these data, L-aspartic acid is expected to biodegrade rapidly."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that L-aspartic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. However, L-aspartic acid has pKa values of 1.92, 3.87, and 9.87(5), indicating that this compound will exist as a zwitterion in the environment. In H(Al) montmorillonite, aspartic acid showed an L-2 type adsorption isotherm with an initial preferential sorption when compared with the solvent or other solutes followed by a decrease in sorption as more solute was sorbed(4)."
