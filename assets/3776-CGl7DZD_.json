            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: Typical isopropanol removal efficiencies for an anaerobic lagoon treatment facility, with a retention time of 15 days, were 50% after loading with dilute waste, and 69 and 74% after loading with concentrated wastes(1). In closed bottle studies, isopropanol was completely degraded anaerobically by an acetate-enriched culture, derived from a seed of domestic sludge(1). The culture started to use cross-fed isopropanol, after 4 days, at a rate of 200 mg/L/day(1). In a mixed reactor with a 20-day retention time, seeded by the same culture, 56% removal was achieved in the 20 days following 70 days of acclimation to a final concentration of 10,000 mg/L(1). The avg percent removal of isopropanol in semi-pilot scale anaerobic lagoons was 50% in 7.5-10 days for dilute wastes with 60 ppm isopropanol and 69-74% in 20-40 days for concentrated wastes with 175 ppm isopropanol(2). Isopropanol was readily mineralized to methane and carbon dioxide under methanogenic conditions(3). The degradation rate of isopropanol under these conditions in fuel impacted river sediments and industrial/sewage impacted creek sediments was 2.4 ppm C/day (82% of expected methane recovery) and 3.0 ppm C/day (91% of expected methane recovery), respectively(3). The degradation rate of isopropanol in a sediment slurry from a shallow anoxic aquifer under methanogenic conditions was 7.6 ppm C/day (112% of theoretical methane recovery)(4). In anaerobic bioreactor studies using a granular sludge inocula, isopropanol (at 125 ppm initial concentration) degraded with 115.5% of theoretical methane production over a 21-day incubation period(5); acetone was identified as a metabolite(5). In laboratory anaerobic sludge reactor tests using liquid hen manure as inoculum, isopropanol was degraded 100% in a 13-day incubation period with lag period(6)."

There was no difference in mortality rate or mean survival time between IPA exposed and control animals. Clinical signs were observed for some male and female mice during exposures to 2500 and 5000 ppm and included hypoactivity, lack of a startle reflex, narcosis, ataxia (5000 ppm only), and prostration (5000 ppm only). Ataxia was the only exposure-related clinical sign that was noted for the 5000 ppm male and female animals following exposure. Increased body weight and/or body weight gain were observed for both sexes in the 2500 and 5000 ppm groups. The 2500 and 5000 ppm male mice from the recovery group continued to increase body weight and body weight gain to study termination even in the absence of IPA exposure. Absolute and relative liver weights were increased in both male and female mice; relative testes weights were decreased in all IPA-exposed male mice; and absolute and relative brain weights were decreased in the 5000 ppm females. The only organ weight change noted for the recovery animals was a concentration-related absolute and relative increase in liver weight for the male mice. Hematologic parameters were unaffected by IPA exposure. The only gross lesion noted at study termination was seminal vesicle enlargement in the 5000 ppm males. However, microscopic evaluation showed increased incidence of dilation of the seminal vesicles in both the 2500 and 5000 ppm male mice. These effects were not present in the recovery group males. Since the seminal vesicles did not have any associated inflammatory or degenerative changes, the enlargement may have been a result of hormonal imbalance. It is not known whether the /CNS depression/ effects of isopropanol could have affected the secretion of the seminal vesicles. Minimal to mild effects to the kidney including renal tubular proteinosis and tubular dilation were observed following 78 weeks of exposure. The incidence of renal tubular proteinosis was generally significantly increased for all male and female treatment groups relative to controls; however the majority of affected animals showed minimal degrees of tubular proteinosis (i.e., only a few tubules affected), there was no concentration-related gradient in either the frequency of severity of this change, and there was no corresponding evidence of alterations to the glomeruli. Mild to moderate degrees of tubular dilation were observed in a small number of females in the 2500 and 5000 ppm groups (significantly increased only for the 5000 ppm group). This finding, however, was not duplicated in male mice (a significant increase was only seen for the 500 ppm group) nor was it accompanied by evidence of tubular cell degeneration or urinary outflow obstruction ... /Oncogeneticity NOEL >5000 ppm, Toxicity NOEL 500 ppm/"

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ In a rat developmental study, female Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed by oral gavage with either 0, 400, 800, or 1200 mg/kg isopropanol during gestation days 6 to 15. Mortality was observed in the mid- (4%) and high-dose (8%) animals and reduced maternal gestational weight gain on gestational days 0 to 20 associated with significantly reduced gravid uterine weights were noted in the high-dose animals. Fetal body weights were reduced at 800 and 1200 mg/kg. No adverse maternal or developmental effects at 400 mg/kg. No teratogenic effects were noted at any dose tested."
