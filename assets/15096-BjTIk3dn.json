Mean tributyltin concns in American oysters from Sarah Creek, Virginia were 834 ug/kg wet wt(3). Maximum values were 1570 ug/kg and oysters collected in a pristine area contained mean levels of 9 ug/kg. The levels of tributyltin in mussel tissue (n=9) in the Sado Estuary, Portugal were 16-114 ng/g dry wt(2)."

The concn of tributyltin in sediment from two harbors along the Rhine River in Germany were 13 and 182 ng Sn/g dry wt; the high level is from a small harbor that is crowded with pleasure crafts that are believed to be responsible for large releases of tributyltin(2). The concns of tributyltin in harbor sediment in Lake Lucerne, Switzerland was high, up to 2800 ug/g(3). High concns were restricted to the upper 7 cm and decreased significantly below. The dating of cores suggest that tributyltin may persist for more than a decade in sediment. Small amounts of the mono- and di-butyltin were also found in the upper layers of sediment(3)."

            "Value": "MARINE SEDIMENT: While concns of tributyltin in surface water in San Diego Bay declined after restrictions on the use of antifouling paint containing tributyltin in California were enacted. Tributyltin levels in sediment were variable and did not reflect the decreases in levels in the water column. Mean tributyltin levels at 14 sites ranged from 7 to 430 ng/g dry wt between Jan 1989 and July 1990 with the higher values being at yacht basins and naval yards(1). Intertidal sediments at a restricted site downstream from the shipyards in the Sado estuary, Portugal reached levels of 520 ng/g dry wt for tributyltin, over an order of a magnitude higher than samples taken in March(2). This has been ascribed to the cleaning of ships in spring and points up the large seasonal variability in anthropogenic organotin levels. Intertidal and marine levels of tributyltin at other sites in the Sado Estuary were 12-21 and 21 ng/g, respectively. Sediment tributyltin concns from Chesapeake Bay include: 141-1390 ug/kg dry wt at six stations in or near marinas on a northern tributary; 23-290 ug/kg dry wt in Sarah and Kings Creek in Virginia and 920-1300 ug/kg dry wt in the Sarah Creek area(3)."
