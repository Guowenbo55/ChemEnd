Metabolism of pyrazon by soil bacteria results in the utilization of the benzene moiety; the heterocyclic moiety of pyrazon remains unmetabolized(1,3,4). The metabolic product is 5-amino-4-chloropyridazin-3(2H)-one(1,3,4). This heterocycle has been detected in pyrazon-treated soil(4). Soil residues were directly related to organic matter content of soil and inversely related to rainfall during the growing season. Non-biological degradation was ruled out since no degradation occurs in autoclaved soil(4). Further evidence is the exponential character of the degradation curves and the isolation of degrading bacteria(5). The degrading bacteria were found to be sensitive to high temperatures (>37 \u00b0C), strictly aerobic and unable to grow in soil when the pH was adjusted to 4(4). The increase of bacterial population between 4.5 and 29.5 \u00b0C indicates high microbial utilization of the herbicide(3)."

In the same soil with 10% of the pyrazon-incubated soil added, little breakdown occurred in the first month but was almost complete after 45 days. When a second dose of pyrazon was added, degradation was rapid, being nearly complete after 15 days."

It inhibits plant growth and survival primarily by four mechanisms: 1) inhibition of the Hill Reaction and photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation; 2) inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis; 3) photodestruction of chlorophyll; and 4) interference with incorporation of polar lipids in the membranes of chloroplasts. Resistant plant species, such as beets, have the ability to transform the parent compound to less toxic metabolites in the leaves. Sensitive species (millet and tomatoes, for example) are incapable of this transformation."
