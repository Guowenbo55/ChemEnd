    "Description": "Chlorothalonil is a dinitrile that is benzene-1,3-dicarbonitrile substituted by four chloro groups. A non-systemic fungicide first introduced in the 1960s, it is used to control a range of diseases in a wide variety of crops. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a dinitrile, a tetrachlorobenzene and an aromatic fungicide. It is functionally related to an isophthalonitrile.",

At an initial concentration of 40 ppm, 67.5% (20 \u00b0C) and 45.0% (25 \u00b0C) chlorothalonil remained after 7 days in an alluvial silty loam (pH 6.4) held at a 60% moisture capacity(1).

Chlorothalonil biodegraded mainly through dechlorination and partly by substitution reaction yielding the biodegradation products: isophthalonitrile, mono-, di- and tri-chlorinated isophthalonitriles, 2,5,6-trichloro-4-hydroxyisophthalonitrile and 2,5,6-trichloro-4-methoxyisophthalonitrile(1). Aerobic biodegradation half-lives of chlorothalonil in four different soils were reported as 10, 10, 15 and 40 days(2). After 60 days the metabolite 2,5,6-trichloro-4-hydroxyisophtalonitrile was present at up to 32% of the initially applied amount; the metabolite 3-cyano-2,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzamide was present at up to about 7% at both days 7 and 16 of the study. Aerobic aquatic half-lives of chlorothalonil typically range from 2 to 200 hours(2).

            "Value": "Available data on metabolism of chlorothalonil in rats and dogs indicates that the parent chemical is conjugated in liver to glutathione or cysteine-S-conjugates. These conjugates are then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Cysteine-S-conjugates, glutathione conjugates, or mercapturic acids reaching the kidney come into contact with proximal tubular cells, where eventual \"activation\" of pre-mercapturic acids occurs through the action of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, an enzyme found in the cytosol and mitochondria of the cells of the renal proximal tubules. Nephrotoxicity of cysteine-S-conjugates through activation to thiol metabolites is related to renal cortical mitochondrial dysfunction. Respiratory control has been shown to be disrupted by the di- and tri-thiol analogs of chlorothalonil. Osmotic changes occur within the renal cortical tubular cells as a result of toxic insult by the thiol metabolites of chlorothalonil, resulting in vacuolar degeneration followed by cellular regeneration."
