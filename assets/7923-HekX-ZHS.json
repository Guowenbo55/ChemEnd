According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In addition, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C respectively(3). Bioconcentration of maleic anhydride in aquatic organisms is unlikely due its rapid hydrolysis(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Maleic anhydride, present at 100 mg/L, reached 54.8% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(1). Using OECD Guideline 301B (Ready Biodegradability: CO2 Evolution Test), maleic anhydride was found to be readily biodegradable with CO2 evolution rates of 61.6% after 4 days and 93.2% after 11 days(2); it was noted that maleic anhydride hydrolyzes under the test conditions and, as a result, maleic acid is believed to be the test material investigated in the study(2). Another OECD Guideline 301B test determined >90% CO2 evolution within 25 days(2). Using OECD Guideline 301E (Ready Biodegradability: Modified OECD Screening Test) and a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum, maleic anhydride was found to be readily biodegradable with a 73-81% removal after 28 days(2). The TOC and COD-Mn of maleic anhydride, present at 170 mg/L in industrial wastewater, was reduced by 98% and 99%, respectively, after 1 day of acclimation with an activated sludge inocculum from a waste water treatment plant(3). In one report 99% removal was achieved in 4 hr by activated sludge(4). Others report 40-60% theoretical BOD in 5 days with sewage inoculum(5,6). The data suggest that maleic anhydride is expected to biodegrade rapidly(SRC); however, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C, respectively(7). Therefore, the available biodegradation rates are expected to correspond primarily to maleic acid(SRC)."

Lymph node cells (LNC) draining the site of topical exposure to DNCB invariably expressed high levels of the type 1 cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), but only low levels of the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). In each experiment, TMA-activated LNC displayed the converse, type 2, phenotype of cytokine production. The other acid anhydrides in each case provoked a type 2 cytokine secretion profile, with comparable IL-10 expression but somewhat less vigorous IL-4 production compared with that observed following exposure to the reference respiratory allergen TMA. In every experiment relatively low levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 were elaborated by acid anhydride-activated LNC, with the exception of PA-stimulated LNC that displayed increased amounts of IL-12 in comparison with other acid anhydrides. Thus, prolonged topical exposure of mice to five different acid anhydrides in each case resulted in the development of a predominantly Th2-type cytokine secretion phenotype, consistent with the ability of these materials to provoke asthma and respiratory allergy through a type 2 (possibly IgE-mediated) mechanism."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of maleic anhydride can be estimated to be 1(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that maleic anhydride is expected to have very high mobility in soil. However, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C respectively(3). Therefore, potential leaching in soil is expected to be dominated by degradation to maleic acid(SRC)."
