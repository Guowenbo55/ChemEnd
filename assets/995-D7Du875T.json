It has a role as an environmental contaminant and a mouse metabolite. It is an ortho-fused polycyclic arene, an ortho-fused tricyclic hydrocarbon and a member of phenanthrenes.",

A 3-day exposure of golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) to 0.05 mg/L phenanthrene yielded a BCF of 1,760(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCFs suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, phenanthrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 4.97 days has been reported for phenanthrene(6). Log BCFs in algae (Selena strum capricornutum) were measured at 4.22-4.47(7)."

Incubation with sediments for 6 and 60 days yielded degradation rate constants of 6.6X10-5 to 1.1X10-5 1/hr, respectively, and biodegradation half-lives of 437.5 and 2625 days, respectively(2). Microcosms consisting of natural sediments and sterilized pond water in 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks were prepared. The dependence of mineralization rates upon incubation temperature was determined for untreated microcosms and those treated with synthetic oil at 0.01% in the slurry. The sediments in the microcosms were acclimated prior to addition of phenanthrene, which was added at 1 ug/g sediment. The optimal temperatures were 15 and 23 \u00b0C for the untreated and synthetic oil treated sediments, respectively; mineralization rates of the synthetic oil treated sediments were higher than the untreated sediments at all temperatures(2). The rate of mineralization was inversely dependent upon the weight/volume sediment slurry composition(2). When natural and sterilized sediments were inoculated with Beijerinckia sp., biodegradation rates of phenanthrene were higher than in uninoculated natural sediments(2). The half-life of phenanthrene applied to soil at 2.1 ug/g soil and incubated at 15-25 \u00b0C was 26 days(3).

            "Value": "Growing evidence indicates that there is an emerging link between environmental pollution and cardiac hypertrophy, while the mechanism is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether phenanthrene (Phe) could cause cardiac hypertrophy, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We found that: 1) Phe exposure increased the heart weight and cardiomyocyte size of rats; 2) Phe exposure led to enlarged cell size, and increased protein synthesis in H9C2 cells; 3) Phe exposure induced important markers of cardiac hypertrophy, such as atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, and c-Myc in H9C2 cells and rat hearts; 4) Phe exposure perturbed miR-133a, CdC42 and RhoA, which were key regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, in H9C2 cells and rat hearts; 5) Phe exposure induced DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in H9C2 cells and rat hearts; 6) Phe exposure led to methylation of CpG sites within the miR-133a locus and reduced miR-133a expression in H9C2 cells; 7) DNMT inhibition and miR-133a overexpression could both alleviate the enlargement of cell size and perturbation of CdC42 and RhoA caused by Phe exposure. These results indicated that Phe could induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in the rat and H9C2 cells. The mechanism might involve reducing miR-133a expression by DNA methylation."
