However, withdrawal of HCM treatment restored most of these altered parameters. Degenerative changes in the kidney included proximal convoluted tubules devoid of brush boarder with cytoplasmic blebbing, dissolution and sloughing of nuclei. Cortical glomeruli were also affected with epithelial disintegration, pyknosis of podocyte nuclei and mesengial cell hyperplasia. The morphological alterations recovered fully in the low dose compared to the high dose treatment group."

In the present study a single iv dose (8 mg/kg) of chromium trioxide was injected into pregnant hamsters at 8 A.M. on either day 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 of gestation in order to determine the effect of altering the time of treatment on embryotoxicity. Fetuses from females treated with chromium or demineralized-distilled water were collected on day 15 of gestation and were examined for the types and frequency of external and internal malformations. The number of resorption sites was recorded. Cleft palate, the major malformation detected, was produced only when chromium was administered on days 7, 8, or 9 of gestation. Since the frequency of resorptions and the incidence of cleft palate varied with the time of treatment it is concluded that the time at which chromium trioxide is injected into the pregnant hamster does influence embryotoxicity. The results suggest that an interference with embryonic growth may be an important factor in chromium-induced cleft palate in hamsters."

The perchromate compounds were more efficient in producing chromosomal aberrations than was a chromate compound, K2CrO4. A 3-valent Cr compound, Cr2(SO4)3, was less toxic and failed to induce a demonstrable increase in chromosomal aberrations. KMnO4 induced aberrations, but at a low rate. As to Ni compounds, NiCl2 and (CH3COO)2Ni induced few aberrations. Administration of K2Ni(CN)4 induced only gaps. NiS induced a low but definite increase in chromosomal aberrations. The rate of these aberrations increased with an increase in treatment time from 24 to 48 hr, indicating a time-dependent increase in the hereditable toxicity of metal compounds. CdCl2 and HgCl2 were somewhat toxic, but failed to induce chromosomal aberrations in the present study."
