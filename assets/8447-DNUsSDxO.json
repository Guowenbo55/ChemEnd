    "Description": "Dibenzothiazol-2-yl disulfide is an organic disulfide resulting from the formal oxidative coupling of the thiol groups of two molecules of 1,3-benzothiazole-2-thiol. It is used as an accelerator in the rubber industry. It has a role as an allergen. It is an organic disulfide and a member of benzothiazoles. It is functionally related to a 1,3-benzothiazole-2-thiol.",

These experimental BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC)."

            "Value": "The teratogenic potential of dibenzthiazyl disulfide (MBTS) was studied in Wistar rats. Pregnant rats were given MBTS at a dosage of 0, 0.04, 0.2 or 1% in the diet from day 0 to day 20 of pregnancy. Daily intakes of MBTS were 26 mg/kg for the 0.04% group 127 mg/kg for the 0.2% group and 596 mg/kg for the 1% group. Maternal body weight gain during day 0 to day 14 of pregnancy in the 1% group was significantly lowered but no significant changes induced by MBTS were observed in any other maternal parameters such as food consumption and clinical sign of toxicity. There were no significant compound related effects on the incidence of pre and post-implantation losses and the number, sex ratio and body weight of live fetuses. Morphological examinations of the fetuses revealed no evidence of teratogenesis. In the postnatal development of the offspring from the dams given MBTS a high survival rate and good growth of the offspring were seen. It could be concluded that MBTS possesses no adverse effects on the pre and postnatal development of offspring in rats at the doses employed in the present study."

The Koc for 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide can be estimated to be about 10,960 based on an estimated water solubility of 0.187 mg/L at 25 \u00b0C and a regression derived equation(2). According to a suggested classification scheme(3), these estimated Koc values suggest that 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide is immobile in soil."
