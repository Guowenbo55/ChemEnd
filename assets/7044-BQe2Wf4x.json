This nephropathy occurs in male rats, is characterized by the accumulation of protein droplets in the S2 segment of the proximal tubule, and results in single-cell necrosis, the formation of granular casts at the junction of the proximal tubule and the thin loop of Henle, and cellular regeneration. Chronic exposure to these compounds results in progression of these lesions and ultimately in chronic nephropathy."

In stark contrast, the NCI-Black-Reiter strain, which does not produce measurable quantities of alpha 2u-globulin, neither forms hyaline droplets nor accumulates any filtered protein in its kidney cortex either spontaneously or after exposure to decalin. Also, female rats injected ip with male rat alpha 2u-globulin exhibit increased hyaline droplet formation and alpha 2u-globulin accumulation when treated with decalin. ..."

Decalin (in corn oil vehicle) was administered at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg body weight to male rats, and 0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.75 or 2.0 g/kg to female rats. Biopsies of the kidneys of selected control and high dose male rats were taken for examination by electron microscopy. Sections of kidneys from all control and treated rats were examined by light microscopy. The kidneys of all male control rats contained minimal levels of hyaline droplets within the cytoplasm of proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells. Decalin induced alterations in the kidneys of male rats included an exacerbation of the hyaline droplet/globule levels found in controls and the formation of granular casts in the outer zone of the renal medulla. The exacerbated formation of hyaline droplets was characterized light microscopically by a marked dose related increase in the number and size of individual droplets/globules and ultrastructurally by a marked increase in the size range of, and the presence crystalline inclusions in, the proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cell phagolysosomal populations. No other ultrastructural alterations occurred that differentiated treated male rats from control males. The formation of granular casts was dose and time related, occurring in 60% of male rats given 0.5 g decalin/kg for 12 days and in 100% of those given 1.0 g decalin/kg for 12 days. Light microscopy revealed no differences between the kidneys of control and decalin treated female rats, and no hyaline droplets or granular casts were observed in the kidneys of any female rat killed after 5 or 12 days."

Left kidneys were evaluated for histopathology and cell proliferation utilizing a proliferating cell nuclear antigen technique and counting proximal renal tubular epithelial cells to determine cell labeling indices. Necropsies and histopathologic evaluations were performed at week 13. Decalin exposure caused increases in kidney weight, urinalysis parameters (protein, AST, LDH), kidney alpha2u-globulin concentration, and proximal convoluted renal tubular cell proliferation in males.

The histopathological changes seen in the urinary bladder of the male rat and the hepatocytes observed in the rat and mouse are unclear and presumably reversible. An alpha2u-globulin nephropathy was seen in the male rat after exposure to 0.287 mg decahydronaphthalene (50 ppm). In a 28-day study, hyaline droplet formation occurred in the proximal tubular cells of the male rat after an oral dose of 10 mg decahydronaphthalene/kg bw. After 14-day post-observation, increased granular deposits were still found in the kidney. Two 90-day inhalation studies are available on Fischer-344 rats of both sexes and female C57/BL6 mice with 0.0287 and 0.287 mg decahydronaphthalene (5 and 50 ppm) and lifetime observation. Both studies reported the formation of hyaline droplets in the kidney at 5 ppm for male rats, which developed into a dose-dependent chronic nephrosis by the time of death. Neoplasias of the kidney were not observed in rats or mice. Although the same rat and mouse strains were investigated in both 90-day studies, the localization of tumors differed in each case. Due to insufficient data in one study, the uterine adenocarcinomas of female rats and the hepatocellular neoplasias of the mouse cannot be evaluated. Increased incidences of pituitary gland adenomas in male Fischer-344 rats and of pituitary gland carcinomas in C57/BL6 mice with advancing age are known in the literature. Since, in the other study, the incidence of pituitary gland tumors in the accompanying control group is unusually low compared to historical controls, the carcinogenic potential of decahydronaphthalene cannot be deduced. The thyroid gland hyperplasias of the mouse were assessed to be a secondary effect of the pituitary gland carcinomas."
