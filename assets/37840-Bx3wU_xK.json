The maximum /2,3,4,5,6-Pentabromoethylbenzene/ (PEB) concentration in Chicago air was 550 pg/ cu m, which was 10 times higher than the concentration of total PBDEs in this sample. In general, the concentrations of PEB in air samples were low but detectable and were less than those of PBDEs. PEB was not found in the sediment core from Lake Michigan. These occurrences of relatively high concentrations of TBE and PEB in environmental samples may reflect the increasing usage of these compounds as flame retardants."
