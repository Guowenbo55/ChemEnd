The VOR connects the labyrinth with the eye muscles via the brainstem, thereby eliciting ocular movements in response to acceleration or deceleration of the head. The test substance (in an emulsion of lipids) was administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 60 min. Test concentrations varied between 0.1% and 10%. MIBK had a depressive effect on VOR. The threshold limit for this effect was 0.2 mM/L (20 ppm) at an infusion rate of 30 uM/kg/min.

The following evaluations were conducted in rats from each exposure level at interim (week 7) and final sacrifices: hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and comprehensive gross pathology. All tissue samples collected during gross necropsy in high-dose and control rats were evaluated for histopathologies, and kidney samples were also histologically evaluated in mid-dose rats.  Reversible lethargy was observed in rats of both sexes receiving 1000 mg/kg-day (but not at lower dose levels) for a few hours following dosing and reportedly decreased in incidence and severity during the study. Males in the high-dose group showed a slight (9%) but significantly decreased mean body weight gain as compared to controls during the last 2 weeks of exposure, whereas female body weight gain was significantly increased during 5 of the last 6 weeks of exposure. Both male and female food consumption was significantly increased during the second half of the exposure period. The only potentially exposure-related hematological effects observed were slight but statistically significant increases in hemoglobin (+6%) and hematocrit (+8%) at terminal sacrifice in females administered 1000 mg/kg-day and a 15% decrease in lymphocyte count in high-dose males at terminal sacrifice.  The lowest hepatic effect level that was observed in the oral exposure studies was 250 mg/kg-day for increased (+39%) serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in female rats at the terminal sacrifice. The following changes suggestive of adverse liver effects were observed at 1000 mg/kg-day at either interim and/or final sacrifice: increased SGPT (+73%, interim; +34%, terminal) in females as compared to controls, increased serum alkaline phosphatase (+84%, interim) in females, increased serum cholesterol in males (+30%, interim) and females (+59%, interim; +65%, final), increased terminal absolute (+34%, males; +39%, females) and relative (+42%, males; +38%, females) liver weights, decreased albumin/globulin ratio in males (-16%, interim), and minimally increased serum total protein in females (+9%, interim; +10%, terminal).  The only renal effect occurring at 250 mg/kg-day was increased terminal absolute or relative kidney weights in males and females, ranging from 6 to 12% over controls. The following changes suggestive of adverse kidney effects were observed at 1000 mg/kg-day: increased terminal absolute and relative kidney weights (from 25 to 34% in males and from 20 to 22% in females) as compared to controls, increased blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN) in males (+37%, interim), increased serum potassium in males (+34%, terminal), decreased serum glucose in males (-27%, terminal), and a reported increase in urinary protein and ketones in males and females at terminal sacrifice (summary data were not provided). Histological examination of kidney tissues revealed an increased incidence of male rats with mild nephropathy (multifocally distributed swollen or hyperchromatic and flattened renal cortical tubular epithelial cells) at 1000 mg/kg-day (16/20) as compared to controls (4/20) but no increase in such lesions in females.  Significantly increased relative adrenal weights in male (+29%) and female (+11%) rats and slightly increased relative testis weights (+9%) in males were also observed at 1000 mg/kgday. No exposure-related histopathologic lesions were evident in the liver or adrenal glands nor in any other tissue that was examined, aside from the kidney. The NOAEL was estimated to be 250 mg/kg bw/d, based on increases in relative kidney weights for male and female rats administered MIBK at doses of 250 mg/kg bw/d but without histological lesions. Effects at higher doses included kidney changes, hepatomegaly and alterations in clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters. No treatment-related effects of any kind were observed at 50 mg/kg-day."

An increased incidence of hyaline droplets and epithelial regeneration in proximal tubules was noted in male rats exposed to 2000 ppm. No other histological changes were noted. In a subchronic study, animals were exposed to 0, 50, 250, or 1000 ppm methyl isobutyl ketone 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 14 wk. Body weights of rats and mice were similar to the controls throughout the 14 wk. In male rats the absolute and relative liver weights after exposure to 1000 ppm were significantly (p< 0.001) larger than the controls. In female rats absolute, but not relative, kidney weight was increased by exposure to 250 ppm. A statistically significant (p< 0.01) increase in absolute liver weight in male mice exposed to 250 or 1000 ppm, and an increase in relative liver weight in males exposed to 1000 ppm /were noted/. After exposure to 1000 ppm methyl isobutyl ketone, male rat platelet numbers increased significantly (p< 0.01) whereas eosinophils decreased significantly (p< 0.05) in female rats. Serum cholesterol increased significantly (p< 0.01) in male rats exposed to 250 or 1000 ppm. An increase in urine glucose was observed in male and female rats exposed to 1000 ppm methyl isobutyl ketone. Histopathologic observation showed an increase in hyaline droplets in the kidneys of male rats exposed to 250 and 1000 ppm methyl isobutyl ketone."

Approximately 24 hr after the final dose the kidneys were excised and the left kidney prepared and evaluated for histological changes including protein (hyaline) droplet accumulation, immunohistochemical staining for alpha2u-globulin (alpha2u), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to quantitate renal cell proliferation. The right kidney was prepared for quantitation of total protein and alpha2u using an ELISA. MIBK elicited an increase in protein droplets, accumulation of alpha2u, and renal cell proliferation in male, but not female rats, responses characteristic of alpha2u-mediated nephropathy. MIBK produced identical histopathological changes in the male rat kidney when compared to d-limonene, an acknowledged inducer of alpha2u-nephropathy except that the grade of severity tended to be slightly lower with MIBK. MIBK did not induce any effects in female rats. Therefore, renal histopathology, along with the other measures of alpha2u accumulation, provides additional weight of evidence to support the inclusion of MIBK in the category of chemicals exerting renal effects through a alpha2u-nephropathy-mediated mode-of-action."

Groups of 30 male and 30 female F0 rats were exposed whole-body to MIBK vapors at mean measured concentrations of 0, 491, 999, and 1996 ppm (0, 2012, 4093, and 8178 mg/cu m) for 6 hr/day for 70 consecutive days prior to mating and throughout mating. F0 females were further exposed until gestation day 20 and again during lactation days 5 to 21; pups were not directly exposed during lactation. Litters were culled to four per sex on lactation day 4. At weaning on lactation day 21, groups of 30 male and 30 female F1 rats at each exposure level were randomly selected, including at least one male and one female from each viable litter. Beginning at 7 days after weaning, selected F1 rats were exposed (using the same exposure schedule that was used for the F0 rats) to mean measured concentrations of 0, 506, 1002, and 2006 ppm (0, 2073, 4105, and 8219 mg/cu m). F0 and F1 parental rats were evaluated for reproductive endpoints (estrous cycle regularity and duration, sperm count, production rate, motility, and morphology, mating and fertility indices, number of days between pairing and coitus, gestation length, parturition, litter size, pup sex ratio, and ovarian follicle counts and corpora lutea in control and high-exposure females), survival, clinical signs, startle response, food consumption, body weight, organ weights, comprehensive gross pathology, and histopathology of major organ systems and all gross lesions (10/sex in control and high-exposure groups and all rats that died prior to terminal sacrifice). F1 and F2 pups were evaluated for developmental endpoints, including post-natal survival (both before and after resumption of maternal exposures during lactation), clinical signs, body weight, and external anatomical integrity (skeletal examinations were conducted in pups with abnormal external changes). F1 pups were also evaluated for balanopreputial separation in males and vaginal perforation in females. Complete gross pathology evaluations were performed in F1 pups that were not selected for mating and in all F2 pups. The report did not mention any examination of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine chemistry in parental groups or offspring of either generation. Parental survival in both generations was unaffected by exposure. Only transient deviations of body weight from control levels were observed in F0 rats. High-exposure F1 parental female body weights were depressed through mating but not throughout gestation and lactation. F1 parental males showed transient depressed body weight at 2073 and 4105 mg/cu m and consistently depressed body weight at 8219 mg/cu m, in spite of elevated food consumption (g food consumed/kg bw/day) in the 8219 mg/cu m exposure group. No exposure-related effect on body weight gain was seen in parental rats of either generation. Among F0 rats, increased relative liver weights (males and females at 8178 mg/cu m) and increased relative kidney weights (males at >/=2012 mg/cu m ; females at >/=4093 mg/cu m) were observed. Significantly increased relative adrenal and ovary weights were also observed in F0 females at 8178 mg/cu m. In the F1 parental groups, significant increases in relative liver weight (males at >/= 4105 mg/cu m; females at 8219 mg/cu m) and relative kidney weight (males at >/=2073 mg/cu m; females at 8219 mg/cu m) were observed, and significantly increased relative seminal vesicle, right testis, left cauda epididymis, and adrenal glands were seen in F1 parental males at 8219 mg/cu m. The incidence of rats with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (considered by the authors to be an adaptive response) was significantly increased in F0 males at >/= 4093 mg/cu m and in F1 parental males at >/= 4105 mg/cu m. The prevalence of nephropathy characterized by inflamed and thickened basophilic tubule membranes was significantly increased in F0 males exposed to 8178 mg/m3 and in F1 parental males at >/=4105 mg/cu m. F1 parental males also showed increased prevalence of acidophilic spherical inclusions/droplets in the renal cortical tubular epithelium at >/= 4105 mg/cu m, but the authors reported that there was no evidence of fully developed alpha2u-globulin-related renal tubular lesions. No other exposure-related gross or microscopic tissue changes were observed in F0 or F1 parental groups. Signs suggestive of CNS depression were observed in mid- and high-exposure parental groups in both generations. Reduced startle response during exposure was observed in F0 males and females at >/=4093 mg/cu m, in F1 parental males at >/= 4105 mg/cu m, and in F1 parental females at 8219 mg/cu m. Transient unsteady gait and prostration were observed among F1 parental males and females approximately 1 hour following exposure to 8219 mg/cu m on several days prior to mating, but the effect attenuated with repeated exposures; similar neurological symptoms were not reported in F0 rats. The only effect reported in offspring was significantly depressed body weights on day 14 postpartum in F1 and F2 male and female pups in mid- and high-exposure groups; however, pup body weights were not different from those of controls on days 7 and 21 post-partum. No other exposure-related changes were observed in any reproductive or developmental endpoint in either generation, including an absence of anatomical changes in F0 and parental F1 reproductive organs."

Animals were sacrificed on gestation day 21. Dams were evaluated for exposure-related changes in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, organ weights (kidney, liver, and gravid uterus), and reproductive parameters; fetuses were evaluated for exposure-related changes in body weight and viability, and for external, skeletal, and thoracic and peritoneal visceral alterations. Maternal mean body weight, weight gain, and food consumption were significantly decreased in rats exposed to 12,292 mg/cu m (but not to 4106 mg/cu m or lower) during the exposure period, but they had recovered to control levels by the day of sacrifice. Maternal clinical signs observed in rats included coordination loss, hindlimb weakness, paresis, irregular gait, hypoactivity, ataxia, unkempt fur, negative tail or toe pinch, piloerection, lacrimation, or red perioral encrustation. These clinical signs were observed only during the exposure period and only at 12,292 mg/cu m. No exposure-related deaths occurred in the rat exposure groups. Statistical analyses by the authors were per dam or per litter. No exposure-related effects were observed in rats with respect to numbers of corpora lutea, total implants, percent implantation loss, live fetuses per litter, nonviable implants per litter, percent live fetuses, and sex ratio. Fetal body weights (litter weight, male weight per litter, and female weight per litter) were significantly reduced in rats exposed to 1229 (the mean by 3%) and 12,292 mg/cu m (the mean by 6%) but not to 4106 mg/cu m. The authors indicated that the reduction in rat fetal body weight was confounded by a skewed distribution of litter size, whereby higher doses had very small litters and smaller litters had varied mean weights across dose, while lower-dosed dams appeared to have larger litters and larger litters showed a dose-dependence in mean weight. There was no statistically significant increase in the number of rat fetuses per litter. The authors decided the reductions in rat fetal body weight was not treatment-related. No exposure-related change in the incidence of malformations of any type were observed in rat fetuses. The number of litters with observations indicating retarded skeletal ossification was significantly increased to various degrees in rats at 12,292 mg/cu m relative to controls for a variety of skeletal endpoints, with scattered increases in litters with retarded ossification at lower exposure levels that were not considered by the authors to be exposure-related. 4106 mg/cu m was considered to be the NOEL for both maternal animals and offspring."

Clinical signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression in the pups were observed and one F(1) pup died after initial exposure to 2000 ppm on postnatal day 22; subsequently exposure was delayed until postnatal day 28. Decreased body weight gain and slight decreased food consumption were observed during the first 2 weeks of exposure in both generations at 2000 ppm. There were no adverse effects on male and female reproductive function or landmarks of sexual maturation. Increased F(0) and F(1) liver weights with associated centrilobular hypertrophy occurred in rats at 2000 ppm, indicative of an adaptive response. Increased male kidney weights at all exposure concentrations, associated with hyaline droplets, were indicative of male rat-specific nephropathy. Other than acute sedative effects, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for parental systemic effects (excluding male rat kidney) was 1000 ppm, based on transient decreased body weight and food consumption; for reproductive effects, 2000 ppm, the highest concentration tested; and for neonatal toxicity, 1000 ppm (based on acute CNS depressive effects)."

Food-restricted and ad libitum-fed Sprague-Dawley male rats were exposed to 0, 250, 750, or 1500 ppm MiBK for 6 hr/day, 5 d/wk for 13 weeks. SCOB testing of food-restricted animals, using a multiple fixed ratio (FR)/fixed interval (FI) schedule (FR20:FI120), was conducted prior to each exposure to maintain the operant behavior; the data from Weeks -1, 4, 8, and 13 were evaluated for evidence of neurotoxicity. SCOB testing was also evaluated for two weeks following the cessation of exposures. Ad libitum-fed animals were included to assess systemic effects using routine indicators such as changes in body weight, food consumption, and organ weight. No significant differences were seen in fixed-ratio run rate, FR pause duration, fixed-interval response rate, and index of curvature values at any concentration. Animals exposed to 750 and 1500 ppm MiBK exhibited clinical signs associated with transient reduced activity levels, but only during exposure. No signs of reduced activity were observed immediately after exposure for either group. No other treatment-related abnormalities were observed during exposure. Food-restricted animals did not demonstrate any increased or decreased sensitivity to the CNS depressive effects of MiBK relative to the ad libitum-fed animals. No treatment-related body weight differences were observed within either the food-restricted groups or the ad libitum-fed groups, although body weights of the former were clearly depressed compared with those of the latter. Relative and absolute liver, and relative kidney weights were significantly greater for the 750 and 1500 ppm ad libitum-fed animals. No differences in kidney weight were observed for food-restricted animals, but absolute and/or relative liver weights were significantly higher for all the treated food-restricted groups. The results of this study indicate that repetitive exposures to high concentrations of MiBK vapors do not result in adverse effects on operant behavior in the rat."
