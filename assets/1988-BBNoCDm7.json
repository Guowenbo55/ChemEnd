    "Description": "Acetochlor is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is N-phenylacetamide carrying an ethyl and a methyl group at positions 2 and 6 respectively on the benzene ring while one of the methyl hydrogens as well as the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom have been replaced by a chloro and an ethoxymethyl group respectively. It has a role as a herbicide, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organochlorine compound and an aromatic amide. It is functionally related to a N-phenylacetamide.",

Results showed acetochlor was taken up via the apoplastic pathway in wheat roots but exhibited little translocation to the stems and leaves, while atrazine entered roots symplastically and transported upwards, distributing less in root organelles which allowed easier movement. Uptake of both herbicides by wheat roots as well as atrazine distribution correlated well with predictions from the partition-limited model, indicating residual atrazine poses a safety threat by uptake and acropetal translocation in wheat.",

Hydroponic experiments were conducted using a concentration of 10 mg L\u22121 for both herbicides. The findings indicate that acetochlor is taken up by wheat roots through the apoplastic pathway and primarily accumulates in the roots with limited upward translocation. In contrast, atrazine is taken up by roots through the symplastic pathway and subsequently transported to the stems and leaves. The preferential distribution of acetochlor in root organelles with higher lipid contents restricts its upward translocation, while atrazine exhibits easier upward translocation due to its low bioconcentration in root organelles and cell walls. The partition-limited model effectively predicts the uptake of acetochlor and atrazine by wheat roots and the distribution of atrazine to the stems and leaves. The results highlight the potential risk to the safety of wheat crops posed by residual atrazine in soil, as it can be taken up by wheat roots and acropetally translocated.",
