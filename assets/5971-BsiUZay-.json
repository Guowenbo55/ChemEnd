Mitotic arrest by AITC was associated with increased ubiquitination and degradation of alpha- and beta-tubulin. AITC directly binds to multiple cysteine residues of the tubulins. AITC induced mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, as shown by cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and formation of TUNEL-positive cells. Inhibition of caspase-9 blocked AITC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, /investigators/ found that apoptosis induction by AITC depended entirely on mitotic arrest and was mediated via Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser-70. Pre-arresting cells in G(1) phase by hydroxyurea abrogated both AITC-induced mitotic arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of a Bcl-2 mutant prevented AITC from inducing apoptosis. /Investigators/ further showed that AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and AITC activates JNK. Taken together, this study has revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of a phytochemical that is commonly present in human diet."

Murine RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were supplemented with increasing concentrations of AITC. In addition, C57BL/6 mice (n= 10 per group) were fed a pro-inflammatory high-fat diet and AITC was administered orally via gavage for 7 days. Biomarkers of inflammation were determined both in cultured cells and in mice. AITC significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA levels and its secretion in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, gene expression of other pro-inflammatory markers including interleukin-1beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase were down-regulated following AITC treatment. AITC decreased nuclear p65 protein levels, a subunit of the transcription factor NF-?B. Importantly, /this/ data indicates that AITC significantly attenuated microRNA-155 levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory effects of AITC were accompanied by an increase in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and consequently by an increase of mRNA and protein levels of the Nrf2 target gene heme-oxygenase 1. AITC was slightly less potent than sulforaphane (used as a positive control) in down-regulating inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. A significant increase in nuclear Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase 1 gene expression and only a moderate down-regulation of interleukin-1beta and microRNA-155 levels due to AITC was found in mouse liver. Present data suggest that AITC exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity in cultured macrophages in vitro but has only little anti-inflammatory activity in mice in vivo."

Quantitative real-time PCR of AITC-treated SW620 cells revealed a time-dependent down-regulation of Cdc25B and Cdc25C mRNA levels, which resulted in a decrease in the expression levels of these two proteins. Upon prolonged exposure, AITC induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in SW620 cells. The apoptotic process was evidenced by the activation of initiator caspases (-8 and -9) and effector caspases (-3 and -7), and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

AITC was effective at a concentration of 10 mum as demonstrated by the inhibition of proliferation of EAT cells when compared with the normal HEK293 cells. It significantly reduced ascites secretion and tumor cell proliferation by about 80% and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor-bearing mice in vivo.

(3)H-thymidine proliferation assay showed that AITC and PITC significantly inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs in vitro.

Treatment with these compounds showed an elevation in the levels of IL-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, which are antiangiogenic factors. Moreover, studies using B16F-10 melanoma cells showed that both AITC and PITC significantly reduced VEGF mRNA expression.

Bolus i.p. injection of 10 micromol AITC, three times per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) beginning the day of tumor cell implantation, significantly inhibited the growth of PC-3 xenograft (P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). For example, 26 days after tumor cell implantation, the average tumor volume in control mice (1025 +/- 205 cu mm) was approximately 1.7-fold higher compared with AITC-treated mice. Histological analysis of tumors excised at the termination of the experiment revealed a statistically significant increase in number of apoptotic bodies with a concomitant decrease in cells undergoing mitosis in the tumors of AITC-treated mice compared with that of control mice. Western blot analysis indicated an approximately 70% reduction in the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the tumor lysate of AITC-treated mice compared with that of control mice. Moreover, the tumors from AITC-treated mice, but not control mice, exhibited cleavage of BID, which is known to promote apoptosis. Statistically significant reduction in the expression of several proteins that regulate G2/M progression, including cyclin B1, cell division cycle (Cdc)25B and Cdc25C (44, 45 and 90% reduction, respectively, compared with control), was also observed in the tumors of AITC-treated mice relative to control tumors.

On the other hand, survival of a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) was minimally affected by AITC even at concentrations that were highly cytotoxic to the prostate cancer cells. Reduced proliferation of PC-3 as well as LNCaP cells in the presence of AITC correlated with accumulation of cells in G(2)/M phase and induction of apoptosis. In contrast, AITC treatment failed to induce apoptosis or cause G(2)/M phase arrest in PrEC cells. A 24 hr treatment of PC-3 and LNCaP cells with 20 micro M AITC caused a significant decrease in the levels of proteins that regulate G(2)/M progression, including Cdk1 (32-50% reduction), Cdc25B (44-48% reduction) and Cdc25C (>90% reduction).

Albeit to a different degree, both ITCs induced genotoxic effects in all test systems. AITC was more genotoxic in bacterial test systems than in Hep G2 cells; in contrast, the effect of PEITC was stronger in Hep G2 cells. In in vivo assays with E. coli indicators in which mice were exposed to relatively high doses of the compounds (90 and 270 mg/kg), AITC induced moderate but significant effects; PEITC failed to induce significant effects in any of the organs. To find out the reason for the weak genotoxicity of AITC and PEITC under in vivo test conditions, /investigators/ exposed E. coli indicator cells to the test substances in the absence or presence of rat liver homogenate (with and without cofactors), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human saliva. All of them markedly attenuated the genotoxicity of AITC and PEITC, implying that the test substances are detoxified by direct non-enzymatic binding to proteins. Additional experiments carried out on the mechanistic aspects of AITC and PEITC-induced genotoxicity showed that the compounds induce the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in Hep G2 cells. Furthermore, in in vitro assays with E. coli, radical scavengers reduced the differential DNA damage induced by AITC and PEITC. The latter two findings give a clue that reactive oxygen species might be involved in the genotoxic effect of the ITCs. Although ITCs have been repeatedly advocated as very promising anticancer agents, the data presented here indicate that the compounds are genotoxic, and probably carcinogenic, in their own right."

The mutagenicity is expressed only in the presence of a rat-liver homogenate metabolizing system, i.e. it is indirect. However, high concentrations of rat-liver homogenate suppress the mutagenicity of allyl isothiocyanate. SKF525, inhibitor of microsomal oxygenase, reduces the mutagenic potential which on the other hand is increased in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2-oxide, inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase. This indicates the occurrence of an epoxide intermediate in allyl isothiocyanate metabolism. Another metabolic pathway, namely hydrolysis to allyl alcohol and oxidation to acrolein, a known mutagen, also seems possible as cyanamide, inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, can slightly increase the mutagenic potential. ..."

Murine RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were supplemented with increasing concentrations of AITC. In addition, C57BL/6 mice (n= 10 per group) were fed a pro-inflammatory high-fat diet and AITC was administered orally via gavage for 7 days. Biomarkers of inflammation were determined both in cultured cells and in mice. AITC significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA levels and its secretion in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, gene expression of other pro-inflammatory markers including interleukin-1beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase were down-regulated following AITC treatment. AITC decreased nuclear p65 protein levels, a subunit of the transcription factor NF-?B. Importantly, /this/ data indicates that AITC significantly attenuated microRNA-155 levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory effects of AITC were accompanied by an increase in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and consequently by an increase of mRNA and protein levels of the Nrf2 target gene heme-oxygenase 1. AITC was slightly less potent than sulforaphane (used as a positive control) in down-regulating inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. A significant increase in nuclear Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase 1 gene expression and only a moderate down-regulation of interleukin-1beta and microRNA-155 levels due to AITC was found in mouse liver. Present data suggest that AITC exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity in cultured macrophages in vitro but has only little anti-inflammatory activity in mice in vivo."
