Ziram exhibited a mutagenic profile in bacterial strains that were deficient in the DNA  excision repair system. These strains included Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535) and (TA100),  and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA. The bacterial assay results also indicated that uvr strains  with adenine/thymine or guanine/cytosine base pairs at target sites were similarly sensitive  to the mutagenic effect of ziram. Ziram was ineffective in the bone marrow micronucleus assay.  It was concluded that ziram is directly mutagenic in bacteria."

Since the molecular target of these compounds is thought to be thyroid  peroxidase  (TPO) which catalyzes the transfer of iodine to thyroglobulin, we examined the  effect of  these compounds on peroxidative activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells  transfected  with the human TPO gene. The activity was inhibited by 50 microM ETU, 5 microM  ziram & 5  microM zineb, the last-mentioned effect being irreversible in the absence of iodide.  Thiram  had no effect. By contrast, the iodinating activity of TPO was blocked only by 5 microM  ETU &  50 microM zineb but not by the other compounds. The effect on TPO-catalysed iodination  could  explain the differences in thyrotoxicity of these compounds in vivo."

However, the compound was immobile in other experiments using a black clay and a red sandy loam soil(1)."
