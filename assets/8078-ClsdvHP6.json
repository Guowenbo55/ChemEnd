Thus, it does not support growth of the degrading organism themselves, but rather are metabolized during the course of the microorganisms growth on another, usually similar, substrate. Initial attack involves oxygenation and subsequent ring cleavage to simple, readily degradable acids(1). 10% degradation in 12 hours was reported using microorganisms isolated from a brackish creek in an area continuously exposed to oil(3). Only slight degradation of cyclohexane was noted in a screening test utilizing a benzene-acclimated activated sludge inoculum(4) and it was listed as degradation resistant according to the MITI test, a screening test of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry(5). Only one biodegradability test was reported in soil in which it was listed as nondegradable with only 0.3% mineralization occurring in 10 wk(6). When incubated at 23 \u00b0C with natural flora in groundwater in the presence of other components of high octane gasoline, 45% degradation was reported after 8 days(7). Cyclohexane, added as a component of gasoline, underwent 45% biodegradation after 192 hrs using microorganisms isolated from groundwater contaminated by a gasoline pipeline break(8)."

Plasma extravasation used as a parameter of inflammation was measured by Evans blue and (125)I-bovine serum albumin (BSA). Total volume of plasma extravasation induced by 4 organic solvents in 240-min exposure was as follows: toluene > m-xylene > cyclohexane > acetone = 0. While hydrophobic solvents (toluene, m-xylene, cyclohexane) induced plasma extravasation, the hydrophilic solvent, acetone, did not induce plasma extravasation. It was suggested that the severity and time course of plasma extravasation depend on chemical characteristics of the organic solvents. In immunohistochemical study, substance P (SP)-immunoreactive nerve fibers (IRNF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-IRNF were intact during 240-min exposure to acetone. In contrast, cyclohexane, toluene, and m-xylene reduced the number of SP-IRNF and CGRP-IRNF in 10 min exposure and further reduced immunoreactivity. In hairless rats treated with systemic capsaicin, the above plasma extravasation was significantly reduced, along with SP-IRNF and CGRP-IRNF; however, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-IRNF was nearly intact. These results indicated that certain organic solvents induce instance of inflammation that vary widely in terms of their severity and time course, and that these differences are correlated with neuropeptides."

Groups of rats and mice were exposed to 0, 500, 2000, or 7000 ppm concentrations of cyclohexane vapor 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 14 weeks. Subgroups of rats and mice were further observed during a 1-month recovery period. Functional observational battery (FOB) and motor activity (MA) behavioral tests were conducted on rats. These tests were conducted prior to the exposure series and during weeks 4, 8, and 13 on non-exposure days. Clinical pathology evaluations were conducted after approximately 7, 13, and 18 weeks. Approximately 14 and 18 weeks after study initiation, tissues from rats and mice were histologically processed and evaluated by light microscopy. During exposure to 2000 or 7000 ppm, rats and mice had a diminished response or an absent response to delivery of a punctate auditory alerting stimulus. Immediately following removal of rats from the inhalation chambers, 7000 ppm males and females and 2000 ppm females displayed a compound-related increase in the incidence of wet and/or stained fur (which occurred in the areas of the mouth, chin, and/or perineum). These signs were transient, were not observed during exposure or prior to exposure the following day, and were not associated with any behavioral or morphological changes. During exposure sessions, mice exposed to 7000 ppm exhibited clinical signs of toxicity which included hyperactivity, circling, jumping/hopping, excessive grooming, kicking of rear legs, standing on front legs, and occasional flipping behavior. Clinical signs of toxicity observed in 7000 ppm mice immediately after exposure included hyperactivity, hyperreactivity, ruffled fur (females only), gait abnormalities, spasms in both rear legs, and excessive grooming (males only). The clinical signs observed in mice during and immediately after exposure were transient, and were not present prior to the subsequent exposure. A few mice exposed to 2000 ppm appeared hyperactive during exposure in the latter portion of the study. There were no compound-related changes in mean body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, food efficiency, or mortality; and there were no ophthalmological abnormalities in rats or mice. In addition, there were no compound-related effects on 37 different behavioral parameters assessed during the FOB or during motor activity tests in rats. Male and female mice exposed to 7000 ppm had slight increases in measures of circulating erythrocyte mass (red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit) and plasma protein concentration (males only). Male rats and male and female mice exposed to 7000 ppm had significantly increased relative liver weights, and 7000 ppm male mice also had significantly increased absolute liver weights at the end of the exposure period. At the end of the 1-month recovery period, absolute and relative liver weights of male and female mice were similar to control. However, relative liver weights of 7000 ppm male rats continued to be significantly higher at the end of the recovery period. Male and female rats exposed to 7000 ppm had a significantly increased incidence of hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy at the end of the exposure period, which was not observed at the conclusion of the 1-month recovery period. No microscopic changes were observed in mice. In rats, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for acute, transient effects was 500 ppm based on a diminished/absent response to an auditory alerting stimulus at 2000 ppm and above. The NOEL for subchronic toxicity in rats was 7000 ppm based on the lack of adverse effects on body weight, clinical chemistry, tissue morphology, and neurobehavioral parameters. In mice, the NOEL for acute, transient effects was 500 ppm based on behavioral changes during exposure at 2000 ppm and above. The NOEL for subchronic toxicity in mice is 2000 ppm based on hematological changes at 7000 ppm."

FR post-reinforcement pause duration and the rate and pattern of FT performance were unaffected. Cyclohexane exposures of 500 or 2000 ppm had no detectable effects. No enduring effects of cyclohexane occurred up to 2 weeks after exposure. An independent set of rats, trained under nominally identical conditions, received various doses (i.p.) of d-amphetamine (AMPH) or chlorpromazine (CPZ) at 1-2 week intervals. Effective doses of AMPH decreased FR running rate, decreased FR post-reinforcement pause duration and increased FI rate of response. AMPH also decreased the FI index of curvature, indicating a change from an accelerating rate during the FI to a more constant rate. Effective doses of CPZ decreased FR rate, increased FR pause duration, decreased FI rate, and decreased FI index of curvature. Thus, schedule-controlled operant procedures that were sensitive to the effects of psychoactive drugs were able to identify only a minor and transient effect of the highest concentration (7000 ppm) of cyclohexane vapor on operant performance."

Cyclohexane was tested at doses of 0.01, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 mg/plate in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of rat and hamster liver S-9. Cyclohexane was negative in these tests and the highest ineffective dose tested in any S typhimurium strain was 10 mg/plate. Some toxicity was exhibited at this dose."

            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ The severity and time course of inflammation induced by 4 organic solvents (acetone, cyclohexane, toluene and m-xylene), and the effect of neuropeptides during the inflammation were investigated in the hairless rat abdominal skin. Plasma extravasation used as a parameter of inflammation was measured by Evans blue and (125)I-bovine serum albumin (BSA). Total volume of plasma extravasation induced by 4 organic solvents in 240-min exposure was as follows: toluene>m-xylene>cyclohexane>acetone=0. While hydrophobic solvents (toluene, m-xylene, cyclohexane) induced plasma extravasation, the hydrophilic solvent, acetone, did not induce plasma extravasation. In immunohistochemical study, substance P (SP)-immunoreactive nerve fibers (IRNF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) -IRNF were intact during 240-min exposure to acetone. In contrast, cyclohexane, toluene, and m-xylene reduced the number of SP-IRNF and CGRP-IRNF in 10 min exposure and further reduced immunoreactivity. Certain organic solvents induce instances of inflammation that vary widely in terms of their severity and time course, and that these differences are correlated with neuropeptides."

Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(2), the Koc for cyclohexane can be estimated to be about 150(SRC). According to a classification scheme(3), these estimated Koc values suggest that cyclohexane is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC)."
