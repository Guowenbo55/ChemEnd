    "Description": "Sulfometuron methyl is a benzoate ester that is the methyl ester of 2-{[(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)carbamoyl]sulfamoyl}benzoic acid. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a member of pyrimidines, a benzoate ester and a N-sulfonylurea. It is functionally related to a sulfometuron.",

            "content": "The study investigated sulfometuron-methyl, a herbicide component in a mixture used in Brazilian sugarcane fields, focusing on its absorption and movement within sugarcane plants at different growth stages. Interestingly, there was no variation in the absorption of sulfometuron-methyl between sugarcane plants at the 2-3-leaf and 5-6-leaf stages. However, significant differences were observed in the distribution of sulfometuron-methyl within the plants. While the total absorption and translocation out of the treated leaf did not differ between the growth stages, the accumulation of sulfometuron-methyl in specific plant parts varied. At the 2-3-leaf stage, more 14C accumulated in the roots, particularly sett roots, whereas in the 5-6-leaf stage, greater accumulation was noticed in the sett. This disparity in accumulation could potentially explain the differences in phytotoxicity responses observed between the two growth stages in the field. The study suggests that although the absorption remained consistent, the varying accumulation patterns within different parts of the plants might contribute to the observed differences in sensitivity to sulfometuron-methyl. Further analysis on sulfometuron-methyl metabolism is recommended to elucidate the underlying causes of differential accumulation and phytotoxic responses among different growth stages of sugarcane plants treated with the herbicide mixture.",
