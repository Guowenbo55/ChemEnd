The CORROSITEX assay was based on exposing a synthetic protein gel matrix biobarrier to the test chemical and measuring the time required for the chemical to destroy the biobarrier.  The Skin2 1350 assay was based on exposing a three dimensional human skin analog to the test agent and determining the extent of destruction of the full thickness preparation after 60 minutes and 4 hours.  The results obtained with the two assays were compared with those obtained previously with the standard in-vivo rabbit assay.  CORROSITEX correctly identified trimethylchlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, ethyltriacetoxysilane, ETS-900, and phenyltriacetoxysilane, the five corrosive compounds in the set, as corrosive.  CORROSITEX classified hexamethyldisilazane as corrosive, whereas the in-vivo test indicated that it was only minimally irritating.  CORROSITEX could not evaluate the other four compounds, all noncorrosive, because they did not react with the biobarrier.
