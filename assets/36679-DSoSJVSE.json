    "Description": "Isoproturon is a member of the class of phenylureas that is 1,1-dimethylurea substituted by a p-cumenyl group at position 3. A selective, systemic herbicide used to control annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in cereals, its use within the EU has been banned after September 2017 on the grounds of potential groundwater contamination and risks to aquatic life; there have also been concerns about its endocrine-disrupting properties. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a herbicide and an agrochemical.",

Effects of isoproturon on 14CO2 fixation and 14C-assimilate translocation were also examined in the test species. The amount of 14C-isoproturon translocated by slender foxtail was about four times greater than by wheat. Foliar application of isoproturon resulted in greater inhibition of photosynthetic 14CO2 fixation in slender foxtail than in wheat. The reduction in 14C-assimilate translocation was also significantly greater in slender foxtail than in wheat.",

The study also found that 14C-isoproturon did not significantly respond to induced sink-demand in either species.
