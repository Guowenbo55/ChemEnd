            "Value": "Aluminum (10, 12.5, 17.5, 25 and 50 uM, as aluminum trichloride) inhibited yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) by a pseudo-first-order reaction. The inhibition was proportional to the incubation time (10 to 60 sec) and the concn of aluminum. Aluminum was a better inhibitor when added to the buffered enzyme prior to the addition of glucose-6-phosphate or NADP+. When aluminum trichloride was added to the buffered mixture of enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate , more than 10 times aluminum trichloride was needed to observe a comparable inhibition. The inhibitory effect of aluminum chloride on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was negligible when aluminum chloride was premixed with NADP+. Double reciprocal plots gave a straight line with a k(inact) of 8.3/min and indicated the presence of a binding step prior to inhibition. The kinetic study showed that 1 mol of aluminum was bound per mol of enzyme subunit. A marked incr in sensitivity to aluminum was observed as the pH decr. An inhibitory effect of aluminum was predominant below pH 7.0, but above pH 8.0, aluminum did not significantly affect the reaction rate of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."

            "Value": "The effect of aluminum on intestinal calcium absorption was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats using an everted intestinal sac technique. Bidirectional calcium flux in the duodena and ilea of normal rats was assessed by means of dual calcium isotopes. Addition of 2 uM aluminum (as aluminum chloride) to the buffer solution significantly inhibited net calcium absorption in the duodenum through suppression of mucosa-to-serosa flux. Serosa-to-mucosa calcium flux was not similarly influenced by aluminum. In the ileum, aluminum had no effect on any component of calcium flux. Aluminum did not induce any suppression of glucose transport in either the duodenum or ileum, suggesting that the effect on calcium transport is relatively specific."

Addition of low concn of aluminum chloride (3.6-36 uM) incr the ATP pool 20-40% within 24 hr, the effect being more marked with time. When using the Tris-EDTA boiling technique for extraction of cellular ATP, the ATP from aluminum-exposed cells appeared more stable during the extraction than the ATP from untreated cells. The higher ATP pools in aluminum-exposed cells were also evident after dark treatment and addition of the phosphorylating inhibitors carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The formation of elevated ATP pools in cells exposed to aluminum was curtailed by high concn of cellular phosphate and postincubation at high pH (> 8)."

            "Value": "Very few investigations have been made on the metabolism and mode of action of aluminum compounds for the reason that it is very poorly absorbed and of low toxicity. The existing evidence indicates that the small portion of aluminum ion that hydrolyzes combines with available phosphate, becomes insoluble and unabsorbed, and so is excreted along with the un-ionized portion. In high doses aluminum compounds have been shown to affect phosphorus metabolism of rats and mice. At lower levels (170 and 355 ppm aluminum as aluminum chloride) aluminum balance studies showed intake and fecal excretion of aluminum were higher at the higher dose, but urinary excretion and retention were not. In phosphorus balance studies made at 160 to 180 and 355 ppm in the diet, the higher dose lowered phosphorus retention, although phosphorus content of the liver and femur were not affected. Chronic and acute poisoning by aluminum chloride caused, on intraperitoneal administration of (32)H-labelled disodium hydrogen phosphate, decreased incorporation of (32)phosphorus in the phospholipids and nucleic acids of various rat tissues. Decreased adenosine triphosphate levels and a rise in the adenosine diphosphate level in plasma also occurred, indicating interference with tissue phosphorylation process."

Aluminum trichloride, at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 10 uM (about 1.3 ng/mL-1.3 ug/mL) activated in vitro (gamma-32P)ATP phosphorylation of the brain tau-protein in both normal human or Escherichia coli expressed tau forms; in the presence of the kinases P34, PKP, and PKC. However, higher concentration inhibited the tau phosphorylation with P34, PKP, and PKC to a maximum at 1 mM level (about 1.3 mg/mL). At 100 uM to 500 uM (about 13 mg/mL ro 66 mg/mL), the test substance activated histone phosphorylation by P34. The hyperphosphorylation of tau by aluminum(III) was accompanied by molecular shift and mobility retardation in SDS-PAGE. ...These results demonstrated the mechanisms of the longterm neurological effect of aluminum(III) in human brain leading to the formation of the neurofibrillary tangles related to Alzheimer's disease."

The latter consisted of multilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine, representing phospholipid classes located in the outer and inner monolayers of the human erythrocyte membrane. These specimens were studied by scanning electron microscopy, electrophysiological measurements, and x-ray diffraction. The results indicate that Al(III) in the concentration range of 10-100 uM induced the following structural and functional effects: (i) change in the normal discoid shape of human erythrocytes to echinocytes due to the accumulation of Al(III) ions in the outer moiety of the red cell membrane; (ii) perturbation of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and to a lesser extent of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine bilayers, and (iii) decrease in the short-circuit current and in the potential difference of the isolated toad skin, effects that are in accordance with a time-dependent modulation of ion transport in response to changes in the molecular structure of the lipid bilayer."

Unlike the control plaques that contained many osteoblastic mineralizing fronts, the experimental plaques revealed a preponderance of cartilaginous tissue, no evidence of mineralization, increased levels of phosphatase activity, and a reduced calcium content. Plaques developing for 21 days in control animals demonstrated extensive new bone formation and bone marrow development, while those in the experimental group demonstrated unmineralized osteoid-like matrix with poorly developed bone marrow. Alkaline phosphatase activity of the plaques continued to remain high on day 21 post implantation in both control and treated rats.

Animals were injected intraperitoneally with an AlCl3 solution of 1.0 mg/mL/100 g of body weight for 5 weeks, 5 days/wk. Al accumulation was detected by solochrome azurine histochemistry in the brain, where the metal could be visualized in capillaries, endothelial cells and surrounding brain tissues. Changes in the binding properties of the MlAChR after chronic Al treatment were determined with the use of selective and nonselective muscarinic antagonists. Significantly decreased number of maximal MlAChR binding sites (Bmax) as measured by the equilibrium binding of [3H]pirenzepine, were detected in all of the brain areas examined. While the nonselective antagonist [3H] (-)QNB displayed a generally decreased Bmax, value, it reached the level of significance only in the striatum."

There was a significant increase in chromatid-type aberrations over the controls, and these occurred in a nonrandom distribution over the chromosome complement. No dose-response relationship could be demonstrated, although the highest dose of aluminum chloride did produce the greatest number of aberrations. These data are supported by in vitro studies that show that aluminum chloride causes crosslinking of chromosomal proteins and DNA in ascites hepatoma cells from Sprague-Dawley rats. Cross-linking agents frequently produce clastogenic effects due, presumably, to conformational distortions that prohibit proper DNA replication."

By phase-contrast microscopy, Aluminum chloride had no effect on the morphology of undifferentiated (NB2a(-)) or differentiated (NB2a(+)) cells, or on neuritic elaboration and maintenance. Silver staining by the Bielschowsky method, however, demonstrated argyrophilic accumulations in perikarya of many treated NB2a(-) and NB2a(+) cells. The effect was dose dependent, and 1 mM aluminum chloride incr by approx 5-fold the percentages of Bielschowsky positive NB2a(-) and (+) cells over those of untreated cells. At the ultrastructural level, whorls of intermediate filaments were the most prominent abnormalities in neuronal perikarya. Although phosphorylated high molecular wt neurofilament subunits are normally detected by immunocytochemical analyses only within axonal neurites of NB2a/dl cells, aluminum chloride treatment caused the detection of phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament subunits within perikaryal of NB2a(-) and NB2a(+) cytoskeletons."

In honey locust, the meristems of control roots 72 hr after treatment were dividing actively and were densely cytoplasmic. In roots treated with 600 uM aluminum, cell division had almost ceased and the cells were much more vacuolate. In loblolly pine, cells in the meristem of control roots were actively dividing and densely protoplasmic. In treated roots, the impact of aluminum was less pronounced, mitotic divisions were still present, and vacuolation increased mainly in the differentiating cells distal to the meristem.
