            "Value": "AEROBIC: Tributyl phosphate was judged to biodegrade with acclimation in two aerobic screening tests using acclimated sludge and sewage as inoculum(1-2). In one of these tests, 30.4 and 90.8% of theoretical CO2 was evolved in 7 and 28 days, respectively, after 14 days acclimation(1). In a simulated semi-continuous activated sludge biological treatment test, 96% and 56% degradation occurred in 13 and 21 weeks at respective feed rates of 3 and 13 ppm(1). After a 2 day lag, 13% and 100% of tributyl phosphate present degraded in a river die-away test (Mississippi River water) in 4 and 7 days, respectively(1). Tributyl phosphate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 3% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(3). While 0-13% of theoretical CO2 was evolved when trench leachate from Maxey Flats, KY containing tributyl phosphate was incubated with sewage for 24 days, this percentage increased to 38% when a source of nitrogen was added to the test solution(4). Tributyl phosphate was judged to be difficult to biodegrade in seawater and river water based on the results of the 3-day cultivation method by four Japanese institutes(5-6). In a study of contamination of the lower Weser River, Germany, it was found that in the high water periods in the cold months (flow rate >400 cu m/s, avg temp 6.9 \u00b0C) biodegradation of tributyl phosphate was negligible, while during low flow periods in warmer months (flow <300 cu m/s, avg temp 14.9 \u00b0C) biological degradation was 30-50% over a 4-7 day period(7)."
