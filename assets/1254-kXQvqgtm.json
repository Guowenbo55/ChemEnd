            "Value": "Exposure to low temperatures often causes allergic responses or urticaria. Similarly, menthol, a common food additive is also known to cause urticaria, asthma, and rhinitis. However, despite the obvious clinical implications, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inducing allergic responses to low temperatures and menthol have not been determined. Because a non-selective cation channel, transient receptor potential subtype M8 (TRPM8) is activated by cold and menthol, we hypothesized that this channel mediates cold- and menthol-induced histamine release in mast cells. Here, we report that TRPM8 is expressed in the basophilic leukemia mast cell line, RBL-2H3, and that exposure to menthol or low temperatures induced Ca(2+) influx in RBL-2H3 cells, which was reversed by a TRPM8 blocker. Furthermore, menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, induced the dose-dependent release of histamine from RBL-2H3 cells. When TRPM8 transcripts were reduced by siRNA (small interfering RNA), menthol- and cold-induced Ca(2+) influx and histamine release were significantly reduced. In addition, subcutaneous injection of menthol evoked scratching, a typical histamine-induced response which was reversed by a TRPM8 blocker. Thus, our findings indicate that TRPM8 mediates the menthol- and cold-induced allergic responses of mast cells, and suggest that TRPM8 antagonists be viewed as potential treatments for cold- and menthol-induced allergies. /DL-Menthol/"

Menthol acts upon TRPM8 receptors by rapidly increasing intracellular calcium and mobilizing calcium flux through the channels to induce cold response signals at the application site. Aside from its cold-inducing sensation capabilities, menthol exhibits cytotoxic effects in cancer cells, induces reduction in malignant cell growth, and engages in synergistic excitation of GABA receptors and sodium ion channels resulting in analgesia. /DL-Menthol/"

            "Value": "In recent years, the transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) channel has emerged as a promising prognostic marker and putative therapeutic target in prostate cancer. We have found that forced overexpression of TRPM8 in PC-3 cells can inhibit the cell proliferation and motility probably through the TRPM8 activation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether activating the TRPM8 channel by its selective agonist menthol can inhibit the proliferation and motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) with remarkable expression of TRPM8. Menthol is a naturally occurring compound, which has been widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and also as flavoring in food. DU145 cells are androgen-independent but have a remarkable expression of TRPM8. The demonstration of the existence of TRPM8 and the absence of TRPA1 in DU145 cells provided the foundation for the following experiments, because both TRPM8 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of menthol. The outcome of MTT assay indicated that menthol inhibited the cell growth (p < 0.01). Cell cycle distribution and scratch assay analysis revealed that menthol induced cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase (p < 0.01). Furthermore, menthol inhibited the migration of DU145 cells by downregulating the focal-adhesion kinase. So it suggests that the activation of the existing TRPM8 channels may serve as a potential and pragmatic treatment for those AIPC with remarkable expression of TRPM8, and menthol is a useful compound for future development as an anticancer agent. /DL-Menthol/"

In rats the only effect recorded after 13 weeks of D/L-menthol exposure at 15000 ppm  (corresponding to 937 mg/kg bw/d in males and 998 mg/kg/d in females) was a minimal increase in the severity of spontaneous interstitial nephritis in males, which was considered by the authors of the study as of questionable significance. Thus the NOAEL for this study is 937 mg/kg bw/d for male rats and 998 mg/kg bw/d for female rats. In male and female mice a slight decrease in body weight gain was observed at 15000 ppm but not at 7500 ppm (corresponding to 1956 mg/kg bw/d in males and 2386 mg/kg bw/d in females). Histologic examination of tissues at the 7500 and 15000 ppm levels revealed no compound-related tissue alterations in any of the mice. The sections of lung in control and treated mice revealed early spontaneous respiratory disease lesions (peribronchial and perivascular lymphoid hyperplasia) and occasional focal areas of pneumonitis, which were unrelated to the treatment with the test substance. Also minimal focal interstitial nephritis was noted as a spontaneous lesion which was observed in control and treated mice, and not related to the treatment with D/L-menthol. The NOAEL therefore can be considered with 1956 mg/kg bw/d for male mice and 2386 mg/kg bw/d for female mice based on slightly reduced body weight gain. /DL-Menthol/"

In contrast, mild cooling of the ocular surface has been reported to increase lacrimation via activation of corneal cool primary afferent neurons. The purpose of our study was to determine whether menthol induces corneal cool cell activity and lacrimation via the transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) channel without evoking nociceptive responses. Tear measurements were made using a cotton thread in TRPM8 wild type and knockout mice after application ofmenthol (0.05-50 mM) to the cornea. In additional studies, nocifensive responses (eye swiping and lid closure) were quantified following cornea menthol application. Trigeminal ganglion electrophysiologic single unit recordings were performed in rats to determine the effect of low and high concentrations of menthol on corneal cool cells. At low concentrations, menthol increased tear production in TRPM8 wild type and heterozygous animals, but had no effect in TRPM8 knockout mice, while nocifensive responses remained unaffected. At the highest concentration, menthol (50 mM) increased tearing and nocifensive responses in TRPM8 wild type and knockout animals. A low concentration of menthol(0.1 mM) increased cool cell activity, yet a high concentration of menthol (50 mM) had no effect. These studies indicated that low concentrations of menthol can increase lacrimation via TRPM8 channels without evoking nocifensive behaviors. At high concentrations, menthol can induce lacrimation and nocifensive behaviors in a TRPM8 independent mechanism. The increase in lacrimation is likely due to an increase in cool cell activity./DL-Menthol/"

Recently, a unique bioassay for smoke cytotoxicity using air pollution-sensitive plant cells (tobacco) has been proposed. Model plant cells (tobacco Bel-W3 cells) and human cells (alveolar epithelial A549 cells) suspended in fresh culture media were exposed to cigarette smoke sampled after lighting the tip of cigarettes (with vs. without menthol capsules) which were attached to a glass pipe connected to the cell-containing plastic tubes. Control cultures were also assessed. After exposing tobacco plant cells to cigarette smoke, cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Cell death was significantly enhanced by mentholated smoke, while menthol alone was shown to be inert suggesting that menthol synergistically contributes to the enhancement of cell death, initiated by smoke-associated compounds. The enhanced toxicity of mentholated smoke was confirmed in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. Cigarette smoke cytotoxicity leading to cell death assessed in plant and human model cells was enhanced by menthol. Further research into these findings is encouraged. /L-Menthol/"
