    "Description": "2,4-dimethylaniline is a primary arylamine that is aniline in which the hydrogens at the 2- and 4-positions are replaced by methyl groups. A clear to yellow liquid, it is used in production of certain dyes, pesticides and other chemicals. It is a primary arylamine and a dimethylaniline.",

            "Value": "2,4-Xylidine, incubated in chernozem soil at 500 ppm/kg, was biodegraded within 2 days; its transformation product was stable for >90 days(1). 2,4-Xylidine, initially present at 20 mg/l, was degraded by 36% in 6 hours using an activated sludge inoculum under aerobic conditions(2). In the Japanese MITI test, 2,4-xylidine (present at 100 mg/l) was classified as slow to biodegrade indicating that only 0-29% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(3)."

            "Value": "The Koc of 2,4-xylidine is estimated as approximately 200(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 1.68(1) and a regression-derived equation(2,SRC). According to a recommended classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,4-xylidine has moderate mobility in soil(SRC). However, adsorption to soil due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group to humus or soil organic matter rather than to clay particles may cause decreased mobility of this compound(4,5). Low adsorption is observed at a neutral pH with pure clay minerals or soils for substituted anilines(5)."
