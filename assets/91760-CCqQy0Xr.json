    "Description": "Sulcotrione is an aromatic ketone that is cyclohexane-1,3-dione substituted by a 2-chloro-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzoyl group at position 2. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a herbicide and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is an aromatic ketone, a sulfone, a member of cyclohexanones and a beta-triketone.",

            "content": "Studies were conducted to compare foliar- and root-based absorption and translocation of SC-0051 (proposed name sulcotrione) in corn and soybean using radio-tracer techniques. Visual injury symptoms expressed in soybean by SC-0051 were bleaching in newly formed (meristematic) tissue followed by necrosis. Corn expressed little to no visual injury. SC-0051 was absorbed more rapidly by foliage of corn and soybean than by their roots. Although soybean absorbed more SC-0051 through roots than did corn, there was no difference between species in foliar absorption of SC-0051. SC-0051 was rapidly translocated throughout corn plants but was concentrated mainly in the meristematic tissue of soybean. Even though there were slight differences in absorption and translocation of SC-0051 in corn and soybean, it is likely that differential metabolism of the herbicide explains selectivity.",
