At the two lowest exposure levels the test substance was present entirely as vapor, but at the highest exposure level the test atmosphere was approximately equally divided by mass into respirable droplets (aerosol) and vapor. A comprehensive battery of toxicological evaluations including food consumption, body weight, clinical signs, hematology, and biochemistry revealed no evidence of a systemic effect of exposure. Histopathological examination showed changes indicative of mild nonspecific irritation in the upper respiratory tract of rats exposed at the two highest exposure levels. These changes consisted of foci of necrosis in the ventral cartilage of the larynx of rats exposed at 0.27 or 1.1 mg/L and an increase in eosinophilic inclusions in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal mucosa of rats exposed at 1.1 mg/L.

A crossover mating trial of the F0 mice to determine the affected sex was inconclusive, but suggested that offspring development was compromised in females exposed to 3.5% DEG. Slight maternal (F0) toxicity was noted for the 3.5 DEG group (7% decrease in body weight). The F1 generation, at 3.5% DEG, had decreased body weights at birth and exhibited poor postnatal survival. At the intermediate dose of DEG, body weights of both sexes were depressed at weaning, at onset of mating, and at necropsy. However, no adverse effects on reproduction were observed. DEGEE had no effect on reproduction in the F0 or F1 generation mice despite a 34% decrease in cauda epididymal sperm motility in the F1 males at 2.5% DEGEE. Other signs of toxicity observed in these F1 mice included increased relative liver weights.

Since then, the ethylene glycol (EG) ether family has been intensively tested. Employers must determine whether EG ethers already in use, or proposed substitutes, are reproductive health hazards. Research data will be summarized to help guide that process. In the EG monoalkyl ether series, both monomethyl (EGME) and monoethyl ethers (EGEE) are testicular toxicants and teratogens, and their acetates are equivalent biologically to the corresponding alkyl ether alcohol. EG ethers with propyl and longer substituents have not been detectable reproductive health hazards. Although higher doses are required than for EGME, several mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives of diEG and triEG exhibit similar toxicity. Mechanistic studies indicate that metabolism by the alcohol dehydrogenase system is a necessary prelude to both testicular and teratogenic effects. Relatively little has been published regarding the propylene glycol (PG) ether family. By analogy to the EG series, propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME) might be expected to be the most potent member of the series, but there are three possible isomers: one secondary alcohol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol (1M2P), and two primary alcohols, 1-methoxy-3-propanol (1M3P) and 2-methoxy-1-propanol (2M1P). The primary alcohol 2M1P is teratogenic. 1M2P, said to represent more than 95 percent of commercial \"PGME,\" is a poor substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase and has not exhibited reproductive or developmental toxicity. The third isomer, 1M3P, has not been tested."

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DEGME), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) and their common metabolite, methoxyacetic acid (MAA) on in vitro chondrogenesis and the mechanisms by which these effects occur. /Chick/ micromass cultures were exposed to DEGME, EGME or MAA for 5 days and proteoglycan abundance and cell proliferation determined. Longer-term 9- and 14-day cultures were exposed to MAA and apoptosis analyzed. All three chemicals decreased proteoglycan abundance and cell proliferation at the highest dose tested (100 uL/mL). However, only MAA showed a dose-dependent effect for both parameters at 0.01, 10, and 100 uL/mL. Furthermore, micromass cultures show an increase in apoptotic cells which when treated with MAA suggest that cell death could result from induced apoptosis. These results suggest that effects of DEGME and EGME are the result of generalized toxicity, but their metabolite MAA induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis during in vitro chondrogenesis."

A volunteer study using a DEGME solution did not identify any skin sensitizing potential. In laboratory animals, a low oral, inhalation and dermal toxicity has been demonstrated, with the kidney and liver being the target organs. Rats given repeated oral doses developed kidney and testicular damage and showed effects on the thymus, blood, liver, spleen and pituitary. No signs of toxicity were identified in a repeated inhalation study in rats. Mild liver toxicity and some blood effects were reported in guinea-pigs given multiple dermal doses. DEGME caused blood abnormalities when applied repeatedly to the skin of pregnant rabbits; doses that were not maternally toxic induced fetotoxicity. Oral administration during pregnancy caused fetal toxicity and fetal malformations in rats (even at non-toxic maternal doses) and embryotoxicity in mice. DEGME gave no evidence of mutagenic potential in Salmonella typhimurium bacteria (Ames test)."

Chemicals were given ad libitum in the drinking water simultaneously with the transplants and continued throughout the study. In all, 20 million leukemic cells were injected sc into syngeneic rats, which after 60 days resulted in a 10-fold increase in relative spleen weights, a 100-fold increase in white blood cell counts, and a 50% reduction in red blood cell indices and platelet counts. Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether given at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL in the drinking water completely eliminated all clinical, morphological, and histopathological evidence of leukemia, whereas the same dose of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether reduced these responses by about 50%. Seven of the glycol ethers were ineffective as anti-leukemic agents, including ethylene glycol, the monopropyl, monobutyl, and monophenyl ethylene glycol ethers, diethylene glycol, and the monomethyl and monoethyl diethylene glycol ethers."
