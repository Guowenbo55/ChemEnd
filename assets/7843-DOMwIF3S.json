            "Value": "AEROBIC: A mean half-life of 5.9 days was reported for all detectable hydrocarbons in an aerobic biodegradation study of gasoline in water from a domestic sewage treatment plant(1). Among the last compounds to be degraded was butane, for which a degradation half-life was calculated as 15 days(1). Within 24 hrs, n-butane was oxidized to its corresponding methyl ketone, 2-butanone(2,3), and the corresponding alcohol, 2-butanol(3,4), by cell suspensions of over 20 methyltrophic organisms isolated from lake water and soil samples(1-3). After 192 hrs, the concentration of n-butane contained in gasoline was reduced from 0.63 to 0.37 uL/L for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline; these data indicate that n-butane was not biodegraded over the study period(5). The biodegradation of n-butane in a Columbia River soil was measured over 50 days; a degradation rate of 1.8 mgC/day/kg dry soil was reported without the addition of nitrogen(6). When nitrogen at 0.15 mg per bottle was added, the degradation rate increased to 11.4 mg C/day/kg dry soil(6). 100% of the initially added n-butane (32.9 mg/L) was biodegraded over 34 days in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum(7)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The degradation of n-alkanes by microorganisms is similar to the degradation of fatty acids. The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having very different rates of activity. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxygenase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes ... /but/ cells grown on C4-C8 alkanes did not oxidize the shorter chain alkanes to a significant extent. ... /n-Alkanes/"

A fatal outcome of butane abuse can be caused by asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia or trauma. The reported number of cases in which death was the consequence of pure butane inhalation is limited, and in most cases a mixture of propellants was involved. This report covers two cases of sudden death due to the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing butane. Autopsy was followed by toxicological, pathohistological and immunohistochemical analysis. Butane gas was confirmed in samples of blood, urine, brain and lungs... Histology showed almost identical changes in the lungs and heart in both cases. The morphology of heart damage on standard H/E stains was of special interest because it displayed all the characteristics of chronic and acute myocardial hypoxia found in the absence of atherosclerotic heart disease. In order to confirm early cardiac death caused by asphyxia due to butane inhalation a panel of immunohistochemical agents was used..."
