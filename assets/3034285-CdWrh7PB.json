    "Description": "Azoxystrobin is an aryloxypyrimidine having a 4,6-diphenoxypyrimidine skeleton in which one of the phenyl rings is cyano-substituted at C-2 and the other carries a 2-methoxy-1-(methoxycarbonyl)vinyl substituent, also at C-2. An inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration by blocking electron transfer between cytochromes b and c1, it is used widely as a fungicide in agriculture. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, an antifungal agrochemical and a quinone outside inhibitor. It is a nitrile, an aryloxypyrimidine, an enoate ester, an enol ether, a methyl ester and a methoxyacrylate strobilurin antifungal agent.",

The wheat-water system reached equilibrium after 96 hours of exposure, with azoxystrobin concentrations found to be much higher in roots than stems and leaves over different exposure times. Azoxystrobin uptake by roots was highly linear as exposure concentrations increased, while the bioconcentration factors and translocation factors were independent of the exposed concentration at equilibrium state. Dead roots were found to adsorb a larger amount of azoxystrobin than fresh roots at different concentrations tested. Azoxystrobin preferentially accumulated in plant organelles and the highest distribution proportion was detected in soluble cell fractions. This study elucidated that passive transport and the apoplastic pathway dominated azoxystrobin uptake by wheat roots, with primary accumulation occurring in roots and the ability for acropetal translocation, however translocation capacity from roots to stems was limited. Additionally, the uptake and distribution of azoxystrobin by wheat plants could be well predicted by a partition-limited model.",

Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin primarily entered roots via the apoplast pathway, whereas trifloxystrobin entered through the symplastic pathway.
