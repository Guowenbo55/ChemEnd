    "Description": "Sulfometuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is urea substituted by 4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl and (2-carboxyphenyl)sulfonyl groups at positions 1 and 3, respectively. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a member of benzoic acids, a member of pyrimidines, a N-sulfonylurea and a monocarboxylic acid.",

            "content": "Sulfometuron, when applied as a foliar and/or soil application, prevented regrowth of bahiagrass. Sulfometuron application did not reduce regrowth of centipedegrass regardless of method of application. Sulfometuron was absorbed by the roots and foliage of centipedegrass and bahiagrass. Symplasmic translocation of the herbicide was evident in both species. Translocation of foliar-applied sulfometuron increased from approximately 1% at 48 h after application to 23% at 72 h in bahiagrass. Metabolism of sulfometuron was greater in centipedegrass (69% of foliar-applied, 10% of root-applied) at 72 h after application than in bahiagrass (30% of foliar-applied and 4% of root-applied). Tolerance of centipedegrass to sulfometuron appeared to be related to a high degree of herbicide metabolism in this species.",
