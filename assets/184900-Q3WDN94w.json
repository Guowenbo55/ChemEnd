    "Description": "Prohexadione is a 4-oxo monocarboxylic acid that is cyclohexanecarboxylic acid which is substituted by oxo groups at positions 3 and 5, and by a propanoyl group at position 4. A plant growth regulator, it is used (commonly as the corresponding calcium salt, known as prohexadione-calcium) as an anti-lodging agent in small-grain cereals. It has a role as an agrochemical, a plant growth regulator and a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a 4-oxo monocarboxylic acid and a beta-triketone. It is a conjugate acid of a prohexadione(2-).",

            "content": "The study investigated the absorption and distribution of prohexadione in sunflowers to understand its impact on O. cumana emergence. When sunflower leaves were treated with prohexadione, the analysis revealed that a significant portion of the compound was absorbed by the leaves, reaching up to 65% of the applied prohexadione after 72 hours. The examination of different plant parts showed that while the amount of prohexadione in the leaf decreased over time, indicating absorption, its proportion in the acropetal part increased to 36%. This indicated movement within the plant from the applied leaf to other parts. Notably, prohexadione was also detected in the roots, escalating from 13% at 24 hours to 23% at 72 hours after application. This evidence strongly suggests that prohexadione is translocated within the sunflower plant, reaching not just the leaves but also the roots over time. Furthermore, the decline in detected prohexadione levels in all analyzed parts, including the leaf surface residue, after 72 hours indicates potential metabolism or excretion by the sunflower roots.",
