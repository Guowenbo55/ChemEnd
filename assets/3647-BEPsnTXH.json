    "Description": "Hydroflumethiazide is a benzothiadiazine consisting of a 3,4-dihydro-HH-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine bicyclic system dioxygenated on sulfur and carrying trifluoromethyl and aminosulfonyl groups at positions 6 and 7 respectively. A diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. It has a role as a diuretic and an antihypertensive agent. It is a benzothiadiazine and a thiazide.",
