An estimated BCF value of 200 was calculated for 4-chlorotoluene(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 3.33(2) and a recommended regression-derived equation(3). According to a recommended classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest that some bioconcentration in aquatic organisms will occur(SRC)."

            "Value": "In the Japanese MITI test, using an initial concn of 100 ppm 4-chlorotoluene, <30% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum(1,2). In the modified MITI test, using an initial concentration of 100 ppm 4-chlorotoluene, 0% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 14 days(3). A microbial blend of 10 different bacteria and 2 fungi was used to degrade 4-chlorotoluene at a concentration of 200 mg/l; complete biodegradation occurred in 3 days(4). Using the cultivation method, 4-chlorotoluene at 20 mg/l was 44% and 64% biodegraded in three days using a river water and a seawater inoculum, respectively(5). An isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida 39/D oxidized 4-chlorotoluene to (+)-cis-4-chloro-2,3-dihydroxy-1-methylcyclohexa-4,6-diene (6). 4-Chlorotoluene is metabolized via cis-dihydrodiol to its respective catechol which is resistant to further degradation(7)."
