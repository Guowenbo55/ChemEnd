Root uptake and partitioning of metribuzin or linuron did not differ when applied alone or combined with clomazone. Binding of clomazone or its metabolites in an unextractable form may be a method of deactivating clomazone by soybean, but not by common cocklebur. Levels of parent clomazone were higher in common cocklebur roots when clomazone was combined with metribuzin and linuron compared to clomazone alone. Levels of parent metribuzin were higher in soybean roots, and in common cocklebur roots and shoots when clomazone was combined with metribuzin compared to metribuzin alone. Levels of parent linuron were greater in soybean shoots when linuron was applied with clomazone compared to linuron alone.

Merr.] and Amaranthus hybridus and in susceptible A. retroflexus and A. lividus. Differential root ab- sorption appeared to play a significant role in the differential response of these four plant species to clomazone. Absorption of root-applied 14C-cloma- zone was greater by the two sensitive Amaranthus weeds than by the tolerant soybean and A. hybri- dus. Following application of 14C-clomazone to roots, most of the absorbed radioactivity was trans- located to the leaves of all four species. Approxi- mately 50% of the absorbed 14C-clomazone was me- tabolized by all four plant species as early as 12 h after treatment. Thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of plant tissue extracts from all four species revealed the formation of two major metabolites of clomazone. These unidentified metabolites had Rf values of 0.4 and 0.8, respectively, in a butanol:ace- tic acid:water (12:3:5, vol/vol/vol) developing sys- tem. The Rf value of unaltered clomazone in this system was 0.95.
