    "Description": "Malic acid is a 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid that is succinic acid in which one of the hydrogens attached to a carbon is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as a food acidity regulator and a fundamental metabolite. It is a 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid and a C4-dicarboxylic acid. It is functionally related to a succinic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a malate(2-) and a malate.",

Using C14-radio-labeled malic acid and a 1-hr incubation period, a 6.7% CO2 evolution was observed in a natural soil degradation study(6); when the soil was sterilized via autoclaving, the CO2 evolution was only 0.1%(6). DL-Malic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 73% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(7)."

Animals were observed daily for mortality.

Clinical pathology studies were performed on five males and five females per group prior to study initiation and at 13, 26, 52, and 104 weeks. After 26 and 52 weeks, 5 male and 5 female test animals per group and 10 male and 10 female control animals were killed; the remaining animals were killed at study termination. Physical appearance, behavior, and survival were similar for test and control animals. Body weight gains were significantly decreased for males and females of the high-dose group during weeks 0 to 52. Feed consumption was statistically significantly decreased for males of the high-dose group during this period. For females of the high-dose group, feed consumption was significantly decreased during weeks 0 to 26 and decreased, but not to a significant degree, during weeks 27 to 52, as compared to controls. These differences were less distinct during the second year; terminal body weights of the high-dose group were similar to controls for male animals and decreased, but not significantly, for female animals. Significant changes were not observed in hematological, blood, or urine parameters. Significant lesions were not found at gross and microscopic examination. For males of the high-dose group, relative thyroid weights were significantly decreased at week 26, relative testes weights were significantly increased and liver weights were significantly decreased at week 52, and spleen weights were significantly increased and relative kidney weights were significantly decreased at study termination as compared to control animals. For females of the high-dose group, heart and body weights were significantly decreased at week 26, body weights were significantly decreased at week 52, and thyroid gland weights were significantly decreased at study termination.
