            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a semi-continuous activated sludge test (Soap and Detergent Association biodegradation test method), the mean degradation for diisodecyl phthalate was 68% in 24 hr(1). In a die-away phase of the testing, it took 9 days to achieve 90% degradation(1). Diisodecyl phthalate is confirmed to be degradable in the screening procedure of the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI) which uses a mixed inoculum derived from soil, fresh water and sewage(2). In an acclimated shake flask CO2 evolution test, loss of parent compound (primary degradation) as well as CO2 evolution (ultimate degradation) was measured using an inoculum prepared from soil and sewage, >99% of diisodecyl phthalate was lost and 56% of theoretical CO2 was evolved after 28 days(3). The biodegradation half-life was 9.6 days with a 4.9 day lag(3). Diisodecyl phthalate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 2% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(4). Diisodecyl phthalate, present at a concentration of 100 ppm, was degraded 14 and 30% after three days cultivation in water from the Mino River and Akashi Beach, Japan, respectively(5). Diisodecyl biodegraded 67% from an initial concentration of 48 ppm and 100 ppm in 28 days in activated sludge at 22 and 25 \u00b0C, respectively(6). Diisodecyl phthalate degraded 42% in 21 days at 25 \u00b0C from a starting concentration of 100 ppm(6). An aerobic aquatic half-life of 23 days was given for diisodecyl phthalate(7)."

There were no treatment-related differences in clinical observations, survival, reproductive organ weights or histopathology, male mating, male and female fertility, female fecundity or female gestational indices in either generation. Starting at about dosing day 42, parental high-dose animals had significantly low mean body weight compared with controls; this effect was more pronounced in F1 high-dose males. Some evidence of reduced body weight gain in the high-dose parental females was also seen during the gestation and postpartum periods which correlated with reduced food consumption. There were no significant differences in clinical or gross observations for offspring in either filial generation (F1 or F2); early survival of high-dose offspring was slightly reduced because of excess offspring deaths in a limited number of litters. Statistically significant lower mean offspring body weights which were similar to the lower mean body weights observed in the parental animals were seen in the F1 and F2 high-dose groups. Cross-fostering experiments showed these body weight effects to be rapidly reversible suggesting a palatability effect. The F1 generation successfully produced normal, healthy offspring after exposure to di-isodecyl phthalate in utero, during lactation, puberty, and adulthood which indicates its lack of transgenerational effects on reproduction."

In the current study, we used a 96-well real-time PCR array containing key target genes representing sexual determination and differentiation, steroidogenesis, gubernaculum development, and androgen signaling pathways to rank the relative potency of several PEs. We executed dose-response studies with diisobutyl (DIBP), dipentyl (DPeP), dihexyl (DHP), diheptyl (DHeP), diisononyl (DINP), or diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) and serial dilutions of a mixture of nine phthalates. All phthalates, with the exception of DIDP, reduced fetal testicular T production. Several genes involved in cholesterol transport, androgen synthesis, and Insl3 also were downregulated in a dose-responsive manner by DIBP, DPeP, DHP, DHeP, DINP, and the 9-PE mixture. Despite speculation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) involvement in the effects of PEs on the fetal testis, no PPAR-related genes were affected in the fetal testes by exposure to any of the tested PEs. Furthermore, the potent PPARalpha agonist, Wy-14,643, did not reduce fetal testicular T production following gestational day 14-18 exposure, suggesting that the antiandrogenic activity of PEs is not PPAR? mediated. The overall sensitivity of the fetal endpoints (gene expression or T production) for the six phthalates from most to least was Cyp11b1 > Star = Scarb1 > Cyp17a1 = T production > Cyp11a1 = Hsd3b = Insl3 > Cyp11b2. The overall potency of the individual phthalates was DPeP > DHP > DIBP >/= DHeP > DINP. Finally, the observed mixture interaction was adequately modeled by the dose-addition model for most of the affected genes. Together, these data advance our understanding of the collective reproductive toxicity of the PE compounds."

The TH disrupting potential was determined by the effect on the TH-dependent rat pituitary GH3 cell proliferation (T-screen). The estrogenic activities of the compounds were assessed in MVLN cells /(a bioluminescent MCE-7-derived cell line to study the modulation of estrogenic activity)/, stably transfected with an estrogen receptor (ER) luciferase reporter vector. Furthermore, the combined effect of a multi-components mixture of six plasticizers was evaluated for its estrogenic and TH-like activities. All the tested compounds, but 2-PP, significantly affected the GH3 cell proliferation. tOP, BBP and DBP activated ER transactivity, whereas DEHP antagonized the 17beta-estradiol induced ER function. The mixture significantly induced ER transactivity in an additive manner, whereas in the T-screen, the observed mixture effect was lower than predicted, suggesting a potential antagonizing effect of the mixture. In conclusion, the tested plasticizers and phenols elicited endocrine-disrupting potential that can be mediated via interference with the estrogen and TH systems. Moreover, the observed mixture effect stresses the importance of considering the combined effect of the compounds for risk assessment of human health."

In the marmoset hepatocyte culture, only minimal changes in PcoA oxidation activity were observed with MIDP, MINP or DINP with poor dose dependency and showed no changes with MEHP. MIDP and MINP caused up to 4 and 3 fold increases in LAH activity. MEHP has no effect. Those studies are indicative of a marked species difference in peroxisomal proliferation by phthalates in cultured hepatocytes."

Of the six major volume use phthalates, three possessed a very weak estrogenic activity (BBP, DBP and DIBP), two did not (DEHP and DIDP) and one (DINP) behaved unreproducibly in the yeast screen. A selection of these, including DINP and DIDP, was also tested for their ability to stimulate proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF -7 and ZR -75 cells). The results were mostly comparable to those obtained from the yeast screen. ... DEHP and DIDP showed relatively little activity. ..."

In vitro all phthalate esters were examined in the following assays: (1) Competitive ligand binding assays: the ability of chemicals to compete with (3)H-E2 for binding to the rat uterine estrogen receptor was investigated 1-1,000 uM of phthalate esters was tested. None of the three phthalate esters effectively competed with (3)H-E2 for binding to the rat uterine estrogen receptor at the concentration tested. (2) Transfection and gene transcription assays: the ability of chemicals to induce reporter gene expression in recombinant receptor/reporter gene assays was investigated. MCF-7 human breast cancer estrogen receptor positive cells or HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells transfected with the Gal4-human ER chimera (Gal4-HEGO) and the Gal4-regulated luciferase reporter gene (17m5-G-Luc) were exposed to final concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 uM of phthalate esters. None of the three phthalate esters exhibited a significant response at the concentrations tested. (3) Estrogen receptor-mediated growth of yeast assay: the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PL 3, transformed with the human estrogen receptor cDNA, was used to examine the ability of phthalate esters to induce estrogen receptor-mediated growth on selective media. None of the three phthalate esters exhibited estrogen receptor-mediated growth at the tested concentration of 10 uM. In vivo /all phthalate esters were examined in the/ uterotrophic assay/vaginal cell cornification assay: 20, 200, 2,000 mg/kg/day of the three phthalate esters were administered by oral gavage once daily for a period of 4 days to ovariectomised Sprague-Dawley rats (10 females per dose, two experiments). Ethynyl Estradiol (EE) was used as a positive control. Body weight, uterine wet weight and percentage of vaginal epithelial cell cornification on each day were assessed. Statistically significant decreases in body weight were observed following treatment with DEHP, however these effects were not dose-dependant. In contrast statistically significant increases in body weight were observed with DIDP and DINP in experiment one only."
