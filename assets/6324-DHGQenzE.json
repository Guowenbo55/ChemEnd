Both the 50% inhibitory pressure (IP(50)) and the minimum inhibitory pressure (MIP), which are regarded as indices of the toxicity of hydrocarbon gases, were determined from growth thermograms.  Based on these values, the inhibitory potency of the hydrocarbon gases increased in the order methane << ethane < propane < i-butane < n-butane. The toxicity of these hydrocarbon gases correlated to their hydrophobicity, suggesting that hydrocarbon gases interact with some hydrophobic regions of the cell membrane. In support of this, /the authors/ found that UV absorbing materials at 260 nm were released from yeast cells exposed to compressed hydrocarbon gases.  Additionally, scanning electron microscopy indicated that morphological changes occurred in these cells."
