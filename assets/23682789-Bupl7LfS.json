    "Description": "Bispyribac-sodium is the organic sodium salt of bispyribac. It is used as a broad spectrum post-emergent herbicide for the control of grasses, sedges and broadleaf weeds in rice crops. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and an environmental contaminant. It contains a bispyribac(1-).",

            "content": "Response of creeping bentgrass, annual bluegrass, and Kentucky bluegrass to foliar, soil, or foliar plus soil applications of bispyribac-sodium was evaluated in greenhouse studies. Soil-alone and foliar plus soil applications of bispyribac-sodium at 148 or 296 g ai/ha resulted in greater injury and shoot dry weight reduction of all species 28 d after treatment (DAT) compared to foliar-alone treatments. Creeping bentgrass was less injured than annual or Kentucky bluegrass regardless of application placement. Further studies evaluated foliar and root absorption and translocation of 14C-bispyribac-sodium in creeping bentgrass, annual bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, and roughtstalk bluegrass. Foliar absorption into creeping bentgrass was less than that of other species at most harvest timings from 4 to 72 h after treatment. Annual and roughstalk bluegrass translocated greater amounts of foliar-absorbed 14C to the crown and shoots compared to creeping bentgrass. Annual and roughstalk bluegrass accumulated approximately 47% more 14C per dry weight of plant tissue than creeping bentgrass and 74% more than Kentucky bluegrass after 72 h in nutrient solution containing 14C-bispyribac-sodium. Annual and roughstalk bluegrass translocated approximately 80% of root-absorbed 14C to shoots, whereas creeping bentgrass and Kentucky bluegrass translocated slightly less (66% of absorbed for both species). These studies suggest that bispyribac-sodium is readily absorbed by roots and translocated to shoots which may contribute to its total activity within a plant. In addition, creeping bentgrass displayed lower amounts of foliar and root absorption and subsequent translocation than annual and roughstalk bluegrass which may contribute to greater bispyribac-sodium tolerance displayed by creeping bentgrass.",

            "content": "Weed competition significantly impacts rice production, and the effectiveness of herbicides in weed control and crop safety relies on the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of the herbicides. This study examined the influence of cold stress (22/16\u00b0C day/night temperature) on the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-bispyribac-sodium in rice seedlings. The results demonstrated that maximum absorption of the herbicide occurred 24 hours after treatment and was enhanced by warm temperatures. The herbicide was mainly retained in the treated leaf, indicating limited translocation to other parts of the plant. When combined with a P450 inhibitor (piperonyl-butoxide), the herbicide caused increased injury to rice plants compared to herbicide alone. Exposure to cold stress further amplified the injury and resulted in higher retention of the parent herbicide in rice plants, highlighting the negative impact on herbicide metabolism. However, cold stress did not affect the translocation of bispyribac-sodium. These findings suggest that cold stress reduces the absorption and metabolism of bispyribac-sodium in rice.",
