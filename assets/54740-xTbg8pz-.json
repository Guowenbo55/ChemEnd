The factors investigated were the addition of 1.24 kg/ha of ammonium sulfate, 5% of the isopropylamine salt of imazapyr, and air temperatures of 18\u00b0C, 27\u00b0C, or 35\u00b0C at either 40% or 100% relative humidity (RH). The results showed that the absorption of 14C-imazethapyr was higher at 100% RH compared to 40% RH (88% vs. 47%). However, at 40% RH, the addition of ammonium sulfate increased the absorption to 79%. At 100% RH, absorption was similar across all treatments. Regarding translocation, when 14C-imazethapyr was applied alone, translocation was greater at 100% RH compared to 40% RH (34% vs. 17%). The addition of ammonium sulfate increased translocation at 40% RH but did not have the same effect at 100% RH. The addition of imazapyr did not affect the translocation of 14C-imazethapyr. The distribution of 14C-imazethapyr throughout the plant showed a greater acropetal (from the base to the apex) movement rather than basipetal (from the apex to the base) movement. The highest distribution of 14C-imazethapyr was observed at an air temperature of 35\u00b0C.",

Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated at the 5% level according to Fisher's Protected LSD Test.
