According to a classification scheme(7), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from high to very high(SRC). Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for heptachlor have been measured for aquatic molluscs (250 to 2,500), oysters (17,600), pelecypod (3,900 to 8,500), decapod (200 to 700), Cyprinodon variegatus (7,400 to 21,300), Lagodon rhomboides (2,800 to 7,700), Leiostomus xanthurus (3,000 to 13,800), Cyprinodon variegatus (3,700 to 4,600), trout(300), and fathead minnow(6,310 to 20,000)(2). BCFs of heptachlor are 3,800 in mosquito fish(3); 3,600 to 7,400 in spot(3); 21,379 in sheepshead minnows(4); 37,000 in snails(3); 21,000 in alga(3); 18,000 in oysters(6); and 17,400 in unidentified fish species(5). At Mar Meno Lagoon (SE Spain), the BCF of heptachlor was measured in plant and aquatic organisms(8): algae (470), red algae (3,220), bivalve mollusc (1,770), and isopods (56,030). The bioaccumulation (ie, concn in biota/concn in soil) of heptachlor by earthworms ranges from 0.92 to 2.7(9). The BCF of heptachlor in vegetation is 0.033(2). Biomagnification of heptachlor in the aquatic food chain is significant, however because it is readily metabolized to heptachlor epoxide by higher tropic level organisms, biomagnification of heptachlor itself is not significant(10)."

Biodegradation of heptachlor by soil microorganisms produced heptachlor epoxide and chlordene(4). Degradation of heptachlor in flooded Casiguran sandy loam after 1 month and Louisiana clay after 2 months was complete (initial level about 13 ppm) and nearly complete in Maahas clay after 3 months(5).

Heptachlor at 50 uM greatly inhibited the state 3 respiration, but inhibited the state 4 respiration hardly at all. The inhibition was released by 2,4-dinitrophenol. The higher dose suppressed state 3 and state 4 respiration almost completely with succinate as substrate.

These three compounds and several metabolites of endosulfan (endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan ether and endosulfan lactone) were examined for their effects on gap junctional intercellular communication in primary cultured male F344 rat hepatocytes and B6C3F1 mouse hepatocytes. Gap junctional intercellular communication was evaluated by Lucifer Yellow CH dye coupling. Endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate inhibited rat and mouse heptocyte gap junctional intercellular communication in a dose responsive manner (50-200 uM) after 4 hr treatment. Endosulfan ether inhibited rat hepatocyte gap junctional intercellular communication only at 200 uM and had no effect on mouse hepatocytes. Endosulfan lactone did not affect rat or mouse hepatocyte gap junctional intercellular communication. Chlordane and heptachlor inhibited both mouse and rat hepatocyte gap junctional intercellular communication at concentrations of 50-200 uM. The inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by the cyclodienes showed similar dose-response relationships and kinetics of onset of inhibition and reversibility for both mouse and rat hepatocytes. Concomitant treatment of the cells with inhibitors of cytochrome p-450 monooxygenases (SKF-525A, piperonyl butoxide or carbon monoxide) did not alter the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by the cyclodienes, suggesting that cytochrome p 450 metabolism was not involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (0.5 mM), however, decreased the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by the cyclodienes and may indicate that these compounds inhibit intercellular communication through a cAMP-dependent process. The inhibition of mouse and rat hepatocyte gap junctional intercellular communication by the cyclodienes correlated with previous reports indicating that these compounds are non-genotoxic rodent liver carcinogens."

Heptachlor at a final concentration of 50 uM with succinate as substrate decreased the respiratory control index due to a marked inhibition of state 3 respiration and a slight inhibition of state 4 respiration. One hundred uM heptachlor with succinate as substrate suppressed the states 3 and 4 respiration almost completely. On the other hand, heptacholor at a final concentration ranging from 50 to 100 uM with beta-hydroxybutylate slightly decreased the respiratory control index and decreased the respiratory control index hardly at all with ascorbate plus N,N,N',N',-tetramethylphenylene diamine as substrate. Heptachlor at a concentration of 50 uM in the presence of succinate also decreased the ADP/O ratio mitochondria.

Heptachlor treated seed had been used in the Columbia River basin near the refuge until 1979 when the use of heptachlor was banned. Lindane was used as a replacement for heptachlor. An egg was collected from each of the 60 nests representing six species between 1978 and 1980 and analyzed for organochlorine pesticide residues. Shell thicknesses of eggs of five species were measured. The thicknesses of eggs of magpies, mallard ducks, and pheasants were compared with those obtained from museum specimens collected before 1947. Twenty seven birds of nine species that were found dead or dying on or near the refuge were assayed for brain organochlorine residues. Fifty eight percent of the eggs collected from 1978 to 1980 contained heptachlor epoxide, a heptachlor metabolite, 50% contained DDE and 37% contained oxychlordane. Low concentrations of cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor, hexachlorobenzene, endrin, and dieldrin were detected in a few eggs. A tern egg contained the highest DDE residue, 1.90 ug/g). The tern egg was the only one that contained polychlorinated biphenyl residues, 1.60 ug/g. No significant shell thinning of eggs was found. The brains of nine birds contained heptachlor epoxide concentrations in excess of 9 ug/g. DDE, oxychlordane, trans and cis-nonachlor, hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dieldrin were also detected. Lindane was not detected in any eggs or brain samples. The authors note that heptachlor epoxide concentrations greater than 9 ug/g cause mortality in experimental birds. Heptachlor treated seed poses a severe hazard to wildlife. Lindane seems to be a safe and effective replacement for heptachlor."

Both products were found to be definitely carcinogenic in the animal species studied, inducing highly significant rates of liver cancer. Neoplasms of other sites were also identified in rats, especially thyroid neoplasms, pituitary neoplasms and adrenal gland neoplasms in males and neoplasms of the reproductive system in females. Mice also showed hepatic vein thrombosis and liver cirrhosis, while rats had interstitial kidney fibrosis, polyarteritis of the mesenteric, pancreatic and other arteries, heart fibrosis, testicular and bone marrow atrophy, and lymph node hyperplasia. An excellent correlation was established between the findings recorded for heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in rats and mice and the results obtained for other organochlorine pesticides in these species. The author concludes that since the occurrence of neoplasms in mammals is similar and since chemicals that are carcinogenic in humans are also carcinogenic in other species, the demonstration of the carcinogenic activity of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in mice and rats represents evidence of the carcinogenicity of these agents in all other mammalian species, including man."

The effects on superoxide anion generation, membrane potential, intracellular and membrane bound calcium ion (+2), and protein kinase activity were determined. All compounds stimulated superoxide anion formation. cis-Chlordane showed the greatest activity, followed in order by heptachlor epoxide, trans-chlordane, and heptachlor. Heptachlor epoxide had the greatest depolarizing effect on polymorphonuclear leukocytes membrane potentials, followed by cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, and heptachlor. All compounds increased intracellular and membrane bound calcium ion (+2) concentrations. No definite trends in terms of molecular structure were discernible. The /results/ conclude that chlordane and chlordane related compounds exert stimulative effects on polymorphonuclear leukocytess in vitro.

Total chlordane residues in the tissue samples of both species of both species were directly proportional to the logarithm of the exposure concentration. The highest residue concentrations were found in the adipose tissue, followed by the liver and blood, in that order. Plasma total chlordane concentrations in monkeys were nearly twice those of the red blood cells. In rats the plasma and red blood cell concentrations were comparable. After exposure ended, the concentrations of total chlordane residues in rats decreased 75 to 90%. The largest decreases occurred in the liver and blood. Total chlordane concentrations in the tissues of female rats were two to three times those of males. No sex related differences were seen in monkeys.

Clinical signs of toxicity were observed, including anorexia and loss of body weight, in the mink that received 25 mg/kg or more heptachlor in the diet. The reduction in feed consumption and loss of body weight were in direct proportion to the concentration of heptachlor in the diet. The lowest observed effect level and the no observed effect level values for mortality of the male mink fed technical grade heptachlor for 28 days followed by a 7 day withdrawal period were 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively.

However, electron transport was inhibited also by high concentrations of chlordane constituents. The inhibitory effect of the chlordane constituents on respiratory activity varied depending on the species of respiratory substrate, suggesting site-specificity of these compounds.

Heptachlor concns ranged from not detected to 0.40 ppm in soil samples collected in 1964, 1966, and 1969 from 16 farms in southwestern Ontario(2). Agricultural soils on the North Coast Region of New South Wales, Australia were shown to contain heptachlor at concns ranging from undetected levels to 0.06 ppm(3). Data from the 1971 National Soils Monitoring Program at 1,486 sampling sites in 37 states showed heptachlor was detected in 4.9% of the samples from cropland soils at concns ranging from 10 to 1,370 ppb(4). A survey was made of 36 Alabama agricultural soils to assess residues of past use of heptachlor(5); the mean concn of heptachlor in this survey was 0.043 ug/kg dry wt (range, <0.02 to 0.121 ug/kg dry wt)(5). The mean concn of heptachlor in contaminated soil at agrichemical facilities (in Illinois) was 50 ug/kg (range, 1.4 to 2,900)(6). Heptachlor was identified in soil extracts from a timber treatment facility near Auckland, New Zealand at a mean concn of 14 ug/kg (range, 0 to 233 ug/kg)(7)."

            "Value": "The Koc values for heptachlor range from 13,330 to 661,000(1,2). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that heptachlor is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). Heptachlor was added to soil columns containing Hagerstown silty clay loam and Lakeland sandy loam which were then subjected to the upward movement of water at an undisclosed rate(3). After 3 days, all the heptachlor was detected in the initial column depth, indicating no tendency to leach in these soils(4)."
