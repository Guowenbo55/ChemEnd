In isolated hepatocytes, ketone body formation from odd chain length fatty acids was slow as compared with even chain length fatty acid substrates, and increased as the carbon chain length was increased from five to seven to nine. In contrast, rates of ketogenesis from butyrate, hexonoate and octanoate were all approximately equal. Propionate (10 mM) inhibited ketogenesis from butyrate, hexanoate and octanoate by 81%, 53%, and 18% respectively. ... The inhibitory effect of propionate could not be explained by shunting acetyl-CoA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as carbon dioxide formation from butyrate was also decreased by propionate. Examination of the hepatocyte acyl-Coenzyme A pool during oxidation of butyrate demonstrated that addition of propionate decreased acetyl-CoA and CoA as propionyl--CoA accumulated. Addition of carnitine decreased propionyl-CoA by by 50% (associated with production of propionylcarnitine) and increased acetyl-CoA and acyl-Coenzyme A Accumulation of propionyl- acyl-CoenzymeA results in inhibition of short chain fatty acid oxidation. Carnitine can partially reverse this inhibition. Changes in the hepatocyte acyl-CoenzymeA pool are consistent with carnitine acting by generating propionylcarnitine, thereby decreasing propionyl-CoA and increasing availability of free CoA. The data provide further evidence of the potential cellular toxicity from organic acid accretion, and supports the concept that carnitine's interaction with the cellular CoA pool can have a beneficial effect on cellular metabolism and function under conditions of unusual organic acid accumulation.[Brass EP, Beyerinch RA; Biochem J 250 (3): 819-25 (1988)]"

            "Value": "The Koc of propionic acid is estimated as 36(SRC), using a log Kow of 0.33(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that propionic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of propionic acid is 4.87(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
