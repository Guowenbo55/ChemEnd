We found a significant increase in the proliferation of splenocytes in the presence of thymol and it proved to be a good mitogen. Uptake capacity of macrophages was enhanced due to increased membrane fluidity after treatment with thymol and it also increases lysosomal activity of macrophages. Data of superoxide anion generation revealed the involvement of thymol in the generation of respiratory burst as it potentiated this property of macrophages at a concentration of 150 uM. In the case of TNF-a, IL-1beta and PGE(2) a decreased level of secretion was observed 154 pg/mL, 736.1 pg/mL, and 151 pg/mL respectively when compared with lipopolysaccharide treated cells, where the level of these cytokines was significantly high. We also determined the anti-complementary activity of thymol which showed to be more effective than rosmarinic acid. Thus, the results obtained from the study suggest the potential role of thymol as a natural immunostimulatory drug which can be used in the treatment of various immunological disorders."

Increased intestinal thymol concentrations were found in the group with 1% thyme compared with the other groups (P<0.05). In liver and muscle tissues the thymol levels were close to the limit of quantification. The data do not indicate a positive effect of thyme on animal performance.

However, the effect of thymol on the physiology of MDCK renal tubular cells is unknown. The action of the phytochemical thymol on cytosolic calcium concentrations and apoptosis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal tubular cells was explored. Fura-2, a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, was used to assess calcium concentrations. Thymol at concentrations of 200-500 uM caused a calcium rise in a concentration-dependent manner. Removal of extracellular calcium partially reduced the effects of thymol. Thymol-induced calcium entry was inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365 and protein kinase C modulators. In a calcium-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibitor thapsigargin inhibited thymol-induced calcium increases. Treatment with thymol also inhibited thapsigargin-induced [Ca+2]i rise. Thymol killed cells at concentrations of 300-500 uM in a concentration dependent fashion. Chelating cytosolic calcium with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/AM (BAPTA/AM) did not prevent thymol cytotoxicity. Thymol (400 and 500 uM) induced apoptosis detected by using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. At 400 or 500 uM, thymol increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Together, in MDCK cells, thymol induced a calcium rise by inducing calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and calcium entry via protein kinase C-sensitive store-operated calcium  channels. Our data suggest that thymol-induced apoptosis might involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) production."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Thymol is the most common molecule in thyme and has been proposed as an oral alternative to antibiotics in the feed of pigs and broilers. The knowledge of the in vivo physiological effects of thymol on tissues is limited, particularly its impact on the gastric mucosa, where it is primarily absorbed when it is orally supplied. In this study, thymol (TH, 50 mg/ kg BW) or a placebo (CO) was introduced directly into the stomach of 8 weaned pigs that were slaughtered 12 h later and sampled for gastric oxyntic and pyloric mucosa. The analysis of whole transcript expression was performed using Affymetrix Porcine Gene 1.1 ST array strips. Affymetrix Transcripts IDs were associated with 13 406 human gene names based on Sus scrofa Ensemble. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed, comparing TH and CO pigs. For each gene set, the normalized enrichment score (NES) was defined as significant when the false discovery rate % was <25 and the P-value of NES was <0.05. In response to TH, 72 and 19 gene sets were significantly enriched in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively. Several gene sets involved in mitosis and its regulation ranked near the top, primarily in the oxyntic mucosa; the gene set DIGESTION ranked first and ninth in the pyloric and oxyntic mucosa, respectively. Within this group, somatostatin (SST), SST receptors, peptide transporter 1 (SLC15A1) and calpain 9 (gastrointestinal tract-specific calpain) were the most strongly upregulated genes. Thymol reduced the enrichment of 120 and 59 gene sets in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively. Several gene sets related to ion transport and channeling and aqueous pores across membranes, including short transient receptor potential (TRP) channel 4, potassium voltage-gated channel members 1 and 2, and ryanodine receptors 2 and 3, were less enriched. The downregulation of these genes sensitive to thymol in vitro could depend on the thymol dose and contact with the gastric tissues that causes an adaptive response with their reduced activation. Conversely, the activation of the TRPA1 gene (ranked 1072 and 128 among all the genes in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively) indicates the involvement of another TRP-regulating cellular calcium storage. In conclusion, the stimulation of gastric proliferative activity and the control of digestive activity by thymol can influence positively gastric maturation and function in the weaned pigs. These properties should be considered in addition to thymol's antimicrobial properties when supplementation of this molecule in feed is evaluated."
