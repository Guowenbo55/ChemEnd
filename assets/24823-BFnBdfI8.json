    "Description": "Ozone is an elemental molecule with formula O3. An explosive, pale blue gas (b.p. -112??) that has a characteristic, pungent odour, it is continuously produced in the upper atmosphere by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on atmospheric oxygen. It is an antimicrobial agent used in the production of bottled water, as well as in the treatment of meat, poultry and other foodstuffs. It has a role as a member of greenhouse gas, a disinfectant, a tracer, an electrophilic reagent, a mutagen, an oxidising agent and an antiseptic drug. It is a member of reactive oxygen species, an elemental molecule, a triatomic oxygen and a gas molecular entity.",

About 17 hr after exposure, rabbits were subjected to several respiratory tests. After the respiratory tests, the rabbits were sacrificed and lungs were examined histologically. The lung of each rabbit exposed to 2 ppm O3 for 6 hr daily for 3 days showed the earlier stage of edema, and tended to trap air as distending pressure was lowered at the measurement of volume-pressure relationship. In this group of animals, dynamic compliance decr, pulmonary flow resistance incr and the flow-volume curve obtained by forced deflation showed a definitely altered slope with reduced flows at the latter part of a descending limb. In rabbits exposed to 1 ppm O3 for 6 hr daily for 6 days, an incr in pulmonary flow resistance was observed to the extent of that found in the other O3 exposed group.

The mixture was seeded on 15 Sept 1983 and exposed to six levels of O3 in 3 m diameter open-top chambers for 12 hr/day from 26 Apr to 18 Oct in 1984, and from 13 Apr to 22 Oct in 1985. The chamber O3 treatments were charcoal-filtered air, nonfiltered air, and four NF treatments to which different levels of O3 were added. The six seasonal 12 hr/day mean O3 concn ranged from 0.025 to 0.092 ul/l. Soil-moisture treatments, obtained by differential irrigation, were well-watered (irrigated when soil matric potential in one or more plots reached -0.4 MPa) or water-stressed (watered at -1.2 MPa). A soil-moisture deficit occurred intermittently in water stressed plants during both seasons. Shoots were harvested when plants reached a height of 20-25 cm. Total forage (clover and fescue) yield in the water stressed plots (O3 levels combined) was 12% less than that in the well-watered plots in 1984 and 14% less in 1985. Clover was much more sensitive than fescue to O3. Ozone-induced suppression of clover growth was accompanied by an increase in fescue growth, and the effects increased as O3 increased. Over the two seasons, est effects of ambient levels of O3 (2 yr seasonal 12 hr/day mean of 0.046 ul/l) were a 10% decrease in total forage yield, a 19% decrease in clover yield, and a 19% increase in fescue yield compared to crops exposed to 0.028 ul/l of O3."

The incr in the number of pulmonary alveolar macrophages in mitosis was preceded by an increase in the labeling index. The labeling index was significantly greater than controls 18 and 42 hr after exposure but returned to near normal levels by 66 hr after exposure. There was a transient decr in the mean nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of pulmonary alveolar macrohages from rats exposed to 1.5 ppm O3, 18 and 42 hr after exposure, due to an incr in the mean cytoplasmic area.

            "Value": "A mathematical formulation was derived that describes the transport and chemistry of atmospheric gases as they diffuse through the open stomata, inner air spaces, and cell walls of plant leaves before depositing on the mesophyllic plasmalemma. The formulation was applied to the problem of ozone deposition on plant leaves to determine whether reactions in the mesophyllic cell wall water can prevent ozone from reaching the plasmalemma and initiating harmful oxidation reactions. Calculations indicate that a major portion of the ozone diffusing through the leaf can react with ascorbic acid in the cell wall. Other mechanisms such as ozone reactions with biogenic olefins and ozone decomposition in the cell wall water were found to be unimportant."

At 2 hr postexposure, a decr (p < 0.05) in lavagable inflammatory cells was noted from a mean control value of 3.8X10+6 to 2.2X10+6 cells/rat. By 72 hr postexposure, an incr (p < 0.05) in lavagable cells was observed which remained above control values for up to 7 days following the exposure. Two distinct effects on rat lung inflammatory cell oxidant generation were observed. Opsonized zymosan and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulated O3 production by the inflammatory cell population was found to be maximally inhibited 24 hr following ozone exposure (47 and 57% of controls, respectively, p < 0.05). In contrast, luminol amplified chemiluminescence increased 24 hr following ozone exposure, coinciding with an incr in the percentage of neutrophils (26 + or - 3% vs 0.1% in controls) and myeloperoxidase (0.521 + or - 0.075 vs 0.002 units/1x10+6 cells in controls) in the inflammatory cell population. Supporting the involvement of myeloperoxidase in the enhanced oxidant generating status of these cells, the luminol amplified chemiluminescence was found to be azide (100 uM) inhibitable (80% inhibition, p < 0.5), but not superoxide dismutase (300 ug/ml) inhibitable. Additionally, this cell population was found to generate taurine chloramines, a myeloperoxidase dependent function which was absent prior to the ozone exposure and also demonstrated enhanced activation of benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol to its light emitting dioxetane intermediate. Addition of myeloperoxidase to control alveolar macrophages resulted in enhanced luminol amplified chemiluminescence, taurine chloramine generation, and enhanced chemiluminescence from benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol."

Transpiration rates and stomatal conductance showed similar trends. Light saturation curves, obtained using a leaf disc oxygen electrode, demonstrated that ozone treated leaves had lower apparent quantum yields and generally lower rates of ozone evolution at saturating light and carbon dioxide levels.

In Allium ursinum, 5 weekly treatments for 4 hr each led to a higher wettability. Interspecific differences were observed in the responses of transpiration and photosynthesis to fumigation. Similar patterns of effects on transpiration and photosynthesis, however, were found in the same species. In Allium ursinum, transpiration was depressed significantly. Carbohydrate metabolism was altered by fumigation, leading to starch accumulation in the leaves. Starch content of Allium ursinum leaves were significantly incr in relation to controls.

Plants of the different cultivars grown under controlled environmental conditions did not differ in superoxide dismutase or peroxidase activity, or in the content of fructose, sucrose or glucose. Differences in O3 sensitivity between cultivars were related to differences in stomatal density and to some degree to the length of the stomatal pore. Stomatal densities were related to leaf conductance, transpiration, and rate of water loss by excised leaves. Leaves of Milkanova (resistant) had higher delta(13)C values than leguminosae California (sensitive).

O3 resistant plants were resistant to both pollutants, showing little biomass reduction particularly from O3. Root/shoot ratios of these plants were altered less by pollutant exposure than non-selected radishes.

Selection for plants sensitive to either pollutant was not apparent from growth analysis, as growth of the sensitive plants was generally the same as that of non-selected plants.

            "Value": "Two cultivars of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and muskmelon (Cucumis melo), which are widely grown in Spain, were exposed to ozone (70 nl/l, 6 hr/day) for 21 days. Ozone sensitivity was assessed by recording the extent of visible injury, changes in fast-fluorescence kinetics, the relative growth rate of root, and shoot, and effects on the number of flowers produced per plant. Leaf gas exchange was measured to provide some indication of the factors underlying differential response to ozone. After 9-10 days of fumigation, all the cultivars developed typical visible symptoms of ozone injury on the older leaves. However, significant (p < 0.05) changes in fast-fluorescence kinetics were detected prior to the development of visible foliar injury, indicating that detectable effects of ozone on primary photochemical processes supersede the appearance of visible symptoms. In both muskmelon and watermelon, there was a marked reduction in the rate of CO2 assimilation as a result of exposure to ozone, and this was accompanied by a parallel decrease in stomatal conductance. Mean plant relative growth rate was markedly (p < 0.01) suppressed by ozone in the two cultivars of watermelon, but there were no significant effects on R in muskmelon. Ozone reduced root growth relative to the shoot in three out of four cultivars. Moreover, exposure to ozone reduced flower production in both muskmelon and watermelon, which indicated effects on yield. There was no correlation between a variety of methods used to assess ozone sensitivity and visible injury. This observation draws clear attention to the dangers in ranking plants for ozone sensitivity purely on the basis of visible symptoms."

            "Value": "Acetylcholine released from vagal nerve endings constricts airways by stimulating M muscarinic receptors on the airway smooth muscle. At the same time, released acetylcholine feeds back onto inhibitory M2 muscarinic autoreceptors on the nerve endings, limiting further release of acetylcholine. Loss of function of these M2 receptors increases vagally-mediated bronchoconstriction after viral airway infections, exposure to ozone, or antigen inhalation. Inflammation appears to be critical in the loss of M2 receptor function after ozone exposure."

            "Value": "Ozone exposurein vivo has been reported to degrade arachidonic acid in the lungs of rodents. To study the chemical nature and biological activity of ozone exposed arachidonic acid, arachidonic acid in a cell-free, aqueous environment was exposed to air, 0.1 ppm ozone, or 1.0 ppm ozone for 30-120 min. arachidonic acid exposed to air was not degraded. All ozone exposures degraded > 98% of the arachidonic acid to more polar products, which were predominantly aldehydic substances and hydrogen peroxide. The type and amount of aldehydic substances formed depended on the ozone concn and exposure duration. A human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B, S6 subclone) exposed in vitro to either 0.1 ppm or 1.0 ppm ozone for 1 hr produced arachidonic acid derived aldehydic substances, some of which eluted with similar retention times as the aldehydic substances derived from ozone degradation of arachidonic acid in the cell-free system. In vitro, ozone degraded arachidonic acid induced an increase in human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte polarization, decreased human peripheral blood T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens, and decreased human peripheral blood natural killer cell lysis of K562 target cells. The aldehydic substances, but not hydrogen peroxide, appeared to be the principal active agents responsible for the observed effects. ozone-degraded arachidonic acid may play a role in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx into lungs and in decreased T-lymphocyte mitogenesis and natural killer cell activity observed in humans and rodents exposed to ozone."

Measurements were made of viability, glucose transport, glutathione, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Mg-ATPase, Na/K-ATPase, and lipid synthesis. The most sensitive parameter was glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the peritoneal macrophage. In hepatocytes both lipid synthesis and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were sensitive to ozone. Effects on viability, glucose transport, Mg-ATPase, and Na/K-ATPase were small to negligible in both cell types."

After three consecutive daily exposures, the animals were returned to filtered air. Seven days after implantation of the minipump, alveolar labeling indices were comparable to control values except in the group of animals exposed for 6 hr nightly to a combination of 0.8 ppm of ozone and 14.4 ppm of nitrogen dioxide. Labeling indices in the peripheral airways were the most sensitive exposure index since they were significantly increased over control values in all animals exposed to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or a mixture of the two gases, regardless of concn or exposure duration. Labeling indices increased with elevated dose rate, eg, concn of the gases in the inspired air. The response to the combined gases was greater than the calculated sum of the responses to the two individual gases for the three higher dose rates in the large airways and for the highest dose rate in the peripheral airways. The results led to the following conclusions: (1) By the criterion of analysis of cell kinetics in rat large and peripheral airways, neither ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nor their mixture follows Haber's law (c x t = k) over the concn ranges studied; and (2) at the higher dose rates studied, there is a more than additive (synergistic) airway response to the combination of ozone and nitrogen dioxide."

            "Value": "Controlled environment facilities were used to determine the growth response of hybrid poplar using concn and exposure frequencies of ozone that mimic ambient patterns. Young cuttings of Populus deltoidesigra were exposed to daily bell-shaped concn profiles of ozone with four peak concn and two exposures per week for 1 to 4 weeks. Exposure to ozone initially stimulated height growth rate, but repeated exposure resulted in decreases in height growth rate. Stem diameter growth rate decreased with increasing ozone concn. Leaf greenness decreased with repeated exposure. The rate of leaf production declined with increasing ozone concn. Many leaves abscised in the higher ozone treatments, resulting ultimately in stimulation of bud break. Leaf area, leaf dry weight, and root dry weight at harvest decreased with increasing total ozone exposure regardless of number of exposures. Stem dry weight was greater after limited initial ozone exposure but was less after repeated ozone exposures. Repeated exposures to ozone were uniformly detrimental to poplar growth parameters."

            "Value": "Oxygen and ozone both have been found to enhance or to inhibit the development of tumors in mouse lung. As a general rule, preexposure to the oxidant, before administration of a carcinogen, or exposure to high levels for a comparatively short time immediately following carcinogen administration favors development of tumors. On the other hand, prolonged exposure begun after a certain time following carcinogen exposure inhibits tumor development. The paradoxical effects of the two oxidants depend on experimental design; results can be tentatively explained in terms of oxidant induced cell proliferation or by oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity. Besides being capable of modifying chemically induced lung tumorigenesis, ozone and oxygen also appear to induce tumors in mouse lung on their own. The conclusions drawn from the study of mouse lung tumors have recently been reinforced in experiments with hamsters, where hyperoxia has clear tumor-modulating effects."

            "Value": "The effects of ozone on tracheal electrical potential were investigated in inbred strains of mice that are differentially susceptible to ozone induced inflammation. In male mice (9-13 wk), a tracheostomy was made under pentobarbital anesthesia for spontaneous breathing and tracheal potential was measured in the cephalad portion of the bisected trachea. The mean tracheal potentials of five different strains of mice (C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and 129/J) were 10 mV (lumen negative) with no significant interstrain difference. Amiloride reduced mouse tracheal potentials by 70% in both C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J mice, indicating that sodium absorption is the predominant ion transport across this tissue. Relative to air-exposed controls, acute ozone exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr) significantly attenuated tracheal potential of inflammation-susceptible C57BL/6J mice by 50% at 6 hr and 40% at 24 hr postexposure but had no effect immediately after exposure. The mean tracheal potential of C3H/HeJ mice was not changed by ozone. The differential effect of acute ozone exposure on tracheal potential in C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice is consistent with differential susceptibility to ozone induced increases in epithelial permeability in these strains."
