    "Description": "Cymoxanil is a member of the class of ureas that is urea in which the two nitrogen atoms are substituted by an ethyl group and a 2-cyano-2-(methoxyimino)acetyl group respectively. A fungicide used to control Peronosporales on a range of crops including vines, hops and potatoes. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of ureas, a nitrile, an oxime O-ether and an aliphatic nitrogen antifungal agent.",

            "content": "[14C]Cymoxanil was applied to either the root system or to the foliage of tomato plants and its uptake, translocation and degradation was followed using autoradiography, combustion and thin-layer chromatographic analyses of water or mcthanolic extracts. Cymoxanil was taken up by the root system within 1 h and translocated to cotyledons, stem and leaves within 16 h, where it was degraded mostly to glycine within 16-44 h. When applied to leaf surfaces, plants treated with a mixture of oxadixyl and [14C]cymoxanil showed enhanced uptake, translocation and degradation (mainly to glycine) of [14C]cymoxanil compared to plants treated with [lnC]cymoxanil alone. Root application data confirm that cymoxanil is a systemic compound with short persistence in tomato plants. Foliage application data suggest the synergism between cymoxanil, oxadixyl and mancozeb in controlling plant diseases caused by Peronosporales does not result from delayed cymoxanil degradation; the mechanism of synergism remains unelucidated.",
