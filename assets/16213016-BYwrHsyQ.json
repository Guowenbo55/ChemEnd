    "Description": "Propaquizafop is a quinoxaline derivative used as systemic herbicide for annual and perennial grasses. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, an agrochemical and a phenoxy herbicide. It is an aromatic ether, an organochlorine compound, a quinoxaline derivative, a carboxylic ester and an oxime O-ether.",

Maximum foliar absorption of propaquizafop, around 35% of the recovered herbicide, occurred 48 hours after treatment. Approximately 30% of the absorbed propaquizafop was rapidly metabolized to the acid form, followed by a slow conversion to a polar metabolite. About 4% of foliar-applied [14C]propaquizafop was translocated from the treated leaflets within 72 hours after application. Proteins from isolated chloroplast stromal and cytosolic fractions were separated and probed, revealing the presence of a multifunctional ACCase in the cytosolic fraction and a 36-kDa biotinylated subunit of the multi-subunit ACCase in the chloroplast stromal fraction. The study suggests that ACCase activity in both fractions exhibits a high level of tolerance to propaquizafop acid and other graminicides, and total ACCase activity in the chickpea chloroplast stroma fraction appears to be composed of activities contributed by both multisubunit and multifunctional ACCases.",
