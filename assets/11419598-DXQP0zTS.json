            "content": "Field studies have shown that the efficacy of foramsulfuron, a herbicide, in controlling dallisgrass is increased when foramsulfuron is applied after MSMA (monosodium methanearsonate) application. To understand the underlying mechanisms, laboratory studies were conducted using mature dallisgrass plants. The laboratory studies focused on the absorption and translocation of 14C-labeled foramsulfuron and examined the impact of preliminary applications (preapplications) of MSMA or foramsulfuron on the absorption and movement of the herbicide. The results showed that herbicide absorption by the dallisgrass plants increased rapidly within the first 4 hours of application. By 8 hours, noticeable differences in absorption were observed between the pretreated plants and the control plants. After 48 hours, the non-pretreated plants absorbed 55% of the applied foramsulfuron, while plants that received either MSMA or foramsulfuron pretreatment absorbed 70% of the herbicide. In terms of translocation, the movement of the herbicide above the treated leaf (younger tissue) and below the treated leaf (older tissue) was measured. In the non-pretreated plants, translocation above and below the treated leaf was 0.65% and 0.62%, respectively. However, pretreatment with foramsulfuron resulted in higher translocation, with 2.12% and 1.55% of applied radioactivity being transported above and below the treated leaf, respectively. Similarly, pretreatment with MSMA also increased translocation, with 2.33% and 2.34% of applied radioactivity being transported above and below the treated leaf, respectively. These findings indicate that pretreatment of mature dallisgrass with either foramsulfuron or MSMA leads to an increase in both the absorption and translocation of foramsulfuron when it is applied two weeks after the pretreatment. The increased absorption and translocation of foramsulfuron in the pre-MSMA-treated plants may explain the enhanced control observed in the field when compared to the pre-foramsulfuron-treated dallisgrass plants.",

            "content": "Foramsulfuron (AE F130360) is a sulfonylurea herbicide commonly used for postemergence control of grasses and certain broadleaf weeds in corn crops. To understand the physiological basis for the varying tolerance of different corn hybrids to foramsulfuron, greenhouse and laboratory experiments were conducted. The tolerance of corn hybrids to foramsulfuron was assessed by determining the herbicide rate required to cause injury and reduce corn height by 15% (GR15). In the greenhouse screening, it was observed that some corn hybrids were sensitive to foramsulfuron, as indicated by their lower GR15 values. However, most of these sensitive hybrids showed increased tolerance when the safener isoxadifen-ethyl was applied along with foramsulfuron. Further experiments were conducted using 14C-labeled foramsulfuron to investigate the effects of isoxadifen-ethyl on foramsulfuron absorption, translocation, and metabolism in two corn hybrids. The sensitive hybrid, Novartis 58D1, and the more tolerant hybrid, Novartis 59Q9, were compared. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the absorption of foramsulfuron between the two hybrids. However, the addition of isoxadifen-ethyl increased foramsulfuron absorption in both hybrids 24 hours after treatment. Translocation of the herbicide within the corn plants was limited, with less than 1% and 3% of the 14C-labeled foramsulfuron being translocated to plant portions above and below the treated leaf, respectively. The primary factor contributing to the differential tolerance of the corn hybrids was found to be herbicide metabolism. Both the sensitive and tolerant hybrids exhibited similar foramsulfuron metabolism at 4 hours after treatment, regardless of the presence of isoxadifen-ethyl. However, by 24 hours after treatment, the more tolerant hybrid metabolized foramsulfuron to more polar compounds to a greater extent compared to the sensitive hybrid.",
