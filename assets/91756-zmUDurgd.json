    "Description": "Ethametsulfuron-methyl is a methyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of ethametsulfuron with methanol. A herbicide used for the control of broad-leaved weeds in oil seed rape and fodder rape. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a diamino-1,3,5-triazine, a N-sulfonylurea, an aromatic ether, a benzoate ester and a methyl ester. It is functionally related to an ethametsulfuron.",

Absorption and translocation of [14C]ethametsulfuron-methyl in rutabaga remained stable over 50 days, with less than 4% of recovered radioactivity in the root. Ethametsulfuron-methyl was metabolized into two major metabolites, O-desethylethametsulfuron-methyl and N-desmethyl-O-desethylethametsulfuron-methyl, after an unstable R-hydroxy ethoxy intermediate dissipated 3 days after treatment. Residue analysis indicated that at a spray dose of 30 g of active ingredient ha-1 and a harvest weight of 0.5 kg, the edible portion of rutabaga root would contain no ethametsulfuron-methyl and 1.3 ppb total of both identified metabolites. Toxicological assessment suggests that ethametsulfuron-methyl and its metabolites pose little or no risk to consumers of rutabagas.\n",

Absorption and translocation of the herbicide showed no differences between the two biotypes. Three days after treatment, approximately 90%, 5%, and 2% of the applied [14C]ethametsulfuron-methyl was found in the treated leaf, foliage, and roots of each biotype, respectively. Acetolactate synthase extracted from both biotypes was equally sensitive to both ethametsulfuron-methyl and chlorsulfuron, indicating that resistance was not due to differences in the target site, absorption, or translocation. However, ethametsulfuron-methyl was metabolized more rapidly in the R than the S biotype, with 82%, 73%, 42%, 30%, and 17% of the recovered radioactivity remaining as ethametsulfuron-methyl in R wild mustard 3, 6, 18, 48, and 72 h after treatment, respectively.
