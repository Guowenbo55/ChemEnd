            "Value": "AEROBIC: In field and laboratory studies, butylate was shown to degrade at accelerated rates in soil after an initial application to a previously untreated soil(1,2); the accelerated degradation may be due to microbial adaptation(SRC). Dissipation of butylate was more than twice as fast in a nonautoclaved soil as compared to the autoclaved soil suggesting a microbial route of degradation(3); butylate sulfoxide was thought to be the microbial metabolite(3); dissipation other than microbial was probably from volatilization(3). Under laboratory conditions, 14C-radiolabeled butylate was degraded more rapidly to 14-C carbon dioxide in soils that had prior exposure to butylate than in soils having no prior exposure(4); over a 36-day incubation period, roughly 18-35% of the 14-C butylate applied to these soils degraded to 14-C carbon dioxide(4). Butylate degraded with a reported half-life of 24 days in sandy loam soil that was incubated for 245 days in darkness at 24 \u00b0C(1). The decline in butylate soil residues is due primarily to volatilization (47%) with aerobic soil metabolism of secondary importance(5). In soil, microbial degradation involves hydrolysis to ethylmercaptan, diisobutylamine and carbon dioxide; the half-life is 1.5-10 weeks(6)."

            "Value": "Based upon experimental adsorption measurements in a silty clay loam soil and a sandy loam soil(1), the Koc of butylate can be calculated to range from 185 to 260(SRC). The US Dept of Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a Koc value of 400 for butylate(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these experimental Koc values suggest that butylate is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC). In one soil column leaching study using three different soil types, most of the initially added butylate remained in the upper 4 in of soil with no butylate leaching below 8 in(1). In a 100-day field study (in silt loam and clay loam soils), butylate was found to have a low mobility as only very small quantities were leached to depth of 45-60 cm(4). Adsorption of butylate has been found to increase as the content of organic matter and clay increases, with a corresponding decrease in leaching(1,5). Based on batch equilibrium experiments, butylate was determined to be mobile to moderately mobile in Keeton sandy loam, Columbia loamy sand, Sorrento loam, and Atterberry silt loam soils(6). The adsorption Freundlich values reported for these soils were 1.5, 4.8, 7.3, and 5.5, respectively(6)."
