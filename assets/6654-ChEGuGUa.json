The (+) enantiomer showed persistent sensory irritation effect on the upper respiratory tract during exposures in the range of 100 to 3691 ppm. The threshold concentration for this effect was calculated to be about 70 ppm, which is close to the no-effect level of about 40 ppm in humans. A significant airflow limitation occurred from exposure concentrations of 200 ppm and higher. No irritating effect was observed at the alveolar level and no central nervous system effect was obvious. In the exposure range from 218 to 5213 ppm, the (-) enantiomer produced only a short-lasting sensory irritation effect during the first 10 min. of exposure and only at concentrations above 2900 ppm. The tidal volume decreased significantly from approximately 400 ppm, but it was first conspicuous above 1000 ppm. Airflow limitation appeared consistently from approximately 2000 ppm. The (-) enantiomer also induced anesthesia/and or pulmonary irritation as well as sudden death at concentrations above 2600 ppm. Overall, the enantiomers showed different time-dependent and stereoselective effects. The lower sensory irritation effect of the (-) enantiomer probably being due to less of the molecule being adsorbed to a sensory irritant receptor."

This study evaluated the effects of OPs and the hydrocarbons themselves on the upper airways, the conducting airways, and the lungs over a longer exposure period. The time course of development of effects and the reversibility of effects were investigated; in addition ... possible exacerbation of sensory responses of the airways to the unreacted hydrocarbons /was assessed/. Respiratory parameters in male BALB/c mice were monitored via head-out plethysmography. Exposures to OPs or hydrocarbons were for 60 min, followed by a 30-min challenge period with air or hydrocarbon, and a 15-min recovery period with air only. ... Ozone concentration in the reaction mixture was 3.4 ppm, and concentrations of hydrocarbons were 47 ppm (alpha-pinene), 51 ppm (d-limonene), and 465 ppm (isoprene). Due to reaction, the ozone concentration at the point of exposure was less than 0.35 ppm; exposure to 0.30 ppm ozone for 60 min did not produce effects different from air-exposed control animals. As previously established, upper airway irritation was a prominent effect of OP exposure. In addition, over the longer exposure period the development of airflow limitation that persisted for at least 45 min postexposure /was observed/. ... Exposures to OPs did not cause enhanced upper airway irritation during challenge with the hydrocarbons, indicating that a 1-hr exposure to OPs did not increase the sensitivity of the upper respiratory system. However, airflow limitation was exacerbated in animals exposed to d-limonene alone immediately following exposure to limonene OPs. These findings suggest that terpene/ozone reaction products may have moderate-lasting adverse effects on both the upper airways and pulmonary regions. This may be important in the context of the etiology or exacerbation of lower airway symptoms in office workers, or of occupational asthma in workers involved in industrial cleaning operations."

Animals were given free access to food and fresh tap water. There were mated one to one with untreated young adult males and the appearance of motile sperm in the vaginal sperm was considered day 0 of gestation. Beginning on Day 6 and continuing daily through Day 10 of gestation, groups (19-23/group) of pregnant females were given 0, 6, 28, 130, or 600 mg/kg bw of the test material by gavage in corn oil. A positive control group received 250 mg/kg bw/day of aspirin. Body weights were recorded on days 0, 6, 8, 10, and 14 of gestation. Females were observed daily for appearance and behavior. Food consumption and body weight were monitored to eliminate any abnormalities that may be associated with anorexia in pregnant females. On Day 14 all dams were subjected to Caesarian section and the number of implantation sites, resorption sites, live fetuses, dead fetuses, and body weight of live pups were recorded. Gestation index, mortality, gross pathology incidence of the dam urogenital tract, number of implantation sites, number of corpora lutea, litter size and weights, sex and sex ratio of pups, and gross abnormalities to pups were reported (these data were described in the robust summary for reproductive effects for the test material). The urogenital tract of each dam was examined for anatomical abnormalities. One-third of fetuses of each litter underwent detailed visceral examination at 10x magnification. The remaining two-thirds were stained with alizarin red S dye/KOH and examined for skeletal defects (the maternal and developmental fetal effects are discussed in this robust summary).   Actual dose received by dose level and sex: 0, 6, 28, 130, or 600 mg/kg bw of the test material (FDA 71-28) Maternal data with dose level: Daily clinical observation and measurement of body weight gain failed to show any differences between control and test groups of female rats. The number pregnant and % pregnancy were similar for all dose and control groups. One pregnant female died in each of the two control groups and the two highest dose groups in the study. No abortions were observed in any group. Fetal Data with Dose Level: The average fetal weight of treatment and control groups were not statistically different (p>0.05). The total number of live fetuses was similar for test and control groups. A small % of (less than 3%) dead fetuses were observed at the three highest dose levels. Skeletal examination of sternebrae showed no significant differences in the incidence of incomplete ossification or missing sternebrae for test and control groups. Likewise the incidences of fetuses with more than 13 ribs, incomplete ossification of vertebrae and extremities, incomplete skull closures were similar for test and control animals. Visceral examination failed to reveal any evidence of abnormalities at any dose level.[USEPA; High Production Volume Information System (HPVIS). Detailed Chemical Results  Chemical Name: Bicyclo"

The rats were maintained in polyethylene metabolism cages, which are constructed to separate feces from urine. Urine was collected on ice for a 24-hour period, removed and sterilized by filtration. Control urines from rats, which received only water, were collected. Ames tests were conducted in strains TA100 and TA98 with and without beta-glucuronidase. 50-300 uL of 24-hour direct urine samples were assayed. After a 48-hour incubation at 37 \u00b0C, each assay plate was counted and the number of spontaneous mutants for either TA98 (40) or TA100 (180) were subtracted from the total number of revertants. Routine positive control plates were prepared to verify the reversion properties of each strain: sodium azide and picrolonic acid were used to check TA100 and TA98 respectively. The positive response to mutagenicity with TA100 is defined as any deviation above the upper 99.9% confidence limits of the mean control value. This value (180) is the average number of spontaneous TA100 revertants observed on the control plates. Testing of alpha-pinene directly using the AMES assay ... was also performed with metabolic activation.

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Camphor, alpha-pinene (the major component of turpentine), and thujone (a constituent in the liqueur called absinthe) produced an increase in porphyrin production in primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells. In the presence of desferrioxamine (an iron chelator which inhibits heme synthesis and thereby mimics the effect of the block associated with acute porphyria), the terpenes enhanced porphyrin accumulation 5 to 20 fold. They also induced synthesis of the rate-controlling enzyme for the pathway, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase. These effects are shared by well-known porphyrogenic chemicals such as phenobarbital and glutethimide. Camphor and glutethimide alone led to the accumulation of mostly uro- and heptacarboxylporphyrins, whereas alpha-pinene and thujone resulted in lesser accumulations of porphyrins which were predominantly copro- and protoporphyrins. In the presence of desferrioxamine, plus any of the three terpenes, the major product that accumulated was protoporphyrin. The terpenes tested are porphyrogenic and hazardous to patients with underlying defects in hepatic heme synthesis."

The present study ... used the rat PLNA to evaluate the immuno-sensitizing potential of 10 monoterpenes found in the essential oils of a variety of aromatic, edible and medicinal plants. The primary or direct PLNA was performed with the monoterpenes, and chlorpromazine (CPZ) and barbital were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Female, 7-8 week-old Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously (50 uL) with the test substance (0.5, 2.5 or 5 mg) into the right hind footpad while the contralateral footpad was injected with the vehicle (DMSO) alone. Weight (WI) and cellularity (CI) indices for draining PLNs were determined 7 days after treatment. PLNA was positive (WI >or= 2 and CI >or= 5) for CPZ, citral, alpha-terpinene, beta-myrcene and (-)-alpha-pinene, and negative for barbital, DMSO, (-)-menthol, 1,8-cineole, (+/-) citronellal, (+)-limonene, (+/-) camphor and terpineol. A secondary PLNA, a T-cell priming test, was carried out with the four substances that had been positive in the primary assay. Six weeks after being locally primed with 5 mg/paw, rats were sc injected into the same footpad with a dose (0.5 mg/paw) of the substance that had been previously found to be insufficient to cause a positive response. WI and CI were then calculated 4 and 7 days after the second injection. CPZ was also positive in the secondary assay thereby confirming that it is a sensitizing agent. Citral, alpha-terpinene, beta-myrcene and (-)-alpha-pinene, however, were negative in the secondary assay. In summary, citral, alpha-terpinene, beta-myrcene and (-)-alpha-pinene induced a clear immuno-stimulatory response due to their irritant properties but no monoterpene proved to be a sensitizing agent in the PLNA."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ To clarify the existence of a receptor protein for sensory irritants in trigeminal nerve endings, D- (ie (+)) and L- (ie (-)) enantiomers of alpha- and beta-pinene as models of nonreactive chemicals were evaluated for their potency in outbred OF1 and NIH/S mice using ASTM E981-84 bioassay. All pinenes possess sensory irritation properties and also induced sedation and signs of anesthesia but had no pulmonary irritation effects. According to the ratio of RD50 (ie, concentration which causes a 50% decrease in respiratory rate,f) and vapor pressure (Po), all pinenes are nonreactive chemicals. For nonreactive chemicals, Po and olive oil-gas partition (Loil) can be used to estimate their potency as sensory irritant. Thus, for enantiomers with identical physicochemical properties, the estimated RD50 values are the same. In addition, although alpha- and beta-pinene do not have identical Po and Loil values, their estimated potencies are quite close. However, the experimental results showed that D-enantiomers of pinenes were the most potent as sensory irritants and a difference in potency also exists between alpha- and beta-pinene. RD50 for D-enantiomers of alpha- and beta-pinene were almost equal, 1053 ppm and 1279 ppm in OF1 strain and 1107 ppm and 1419 ppm in NIH/S strain, respectively. Values differed by a factor of approximately 4 to 5 from L-beta-pinene for which the RD50 was 4663 ppm in OF1 and 5811 ppm in NIH/S mice. RD50 could not be determined for L-alpha-pinene; this pinene was almost inactive. D-alpha-pinene seems to best fit the receptor because its experimental RD50 was one-half of the estimated value while for D-beta-pinene those values were equal. On the contrary, L-beta-pinene was about 3 to 4 times less potent than estimated. L-alpha-pinene was only slightly active although it was estimated to be as potent as D-alpha-pinene. The remarkable difference in potency between L-enantiomers is most likely due to a structural difference between alpha- and beta-pinene: the more flexible beta-pinene can bend to fit into the receptor better than the rigid alpha-pinene."
