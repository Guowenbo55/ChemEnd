            "Value": "The reductive biodegradation of a variety of haloaromatic substrates was monitored in samples from 2 sites within a shallow anoxic aquifer and was compared with freshwater sediment and sewage sludge. The metabolic capacity existing in methane-producing aquifer material was very similar to that in sediment, because 3 of 4 chlorobenzoates, 5 of 7 chlorophenols, and 1 of 2 chlorophenoxyacetate herbicides were reductively dehalogenated in both types of incubations. 2,4-D was first converted to a dichlorophenol before dehalogenation occurred. Sewage sludge microorganisms dehalogenated 4 of 7 chlorophenols tested and degraded both phenoxyacetate herbicides by first converting them to the corresponding chlorophenols, but the micoroorganisms did not transform the chlorobenzoates. In general, the same suite of initial metabolites was produced from a test substrate in all types of samples, as confirmed by cochromatograph of the intermediates with authentic material. The aquifer microbiota from a sulfate-reducing site was unable to significantly degrade any of the haloaromatics substrates tested. Biological removal of the sulfate in samples from this site permitted dehalogenation of a model substrate, whereas stimulation of methanogenesis without removal of sulfate did not. Thus, dehalogenating microorganisms were present at this site but their activity was at least partially inhibited by the high sulfate levels."

In in vitro assay systems, while 2,4-D or DCP alone did not show androgenic activity, 2,4-D or DCP with 5alpha-dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) exhibited synergistic androgenic activities. Co-treatment of 10 nM 2,4-D or DCP with 10 nM DHT was shown to stimulate the cell proliferation by 1.6-fold, compared to 10 nM DHT alone. In addition, in transient transfection assays, androgen-induced transactivation was also increased to a maximum of 32-fold or 1.28-fold by co-treatment of 2,4-D or DCP with DHT, respectively. However, 2,4-D and DCP exerted no effects on either mRNA or protein levels of AR. In a competitive AR binding assay, 2,4-D and DCP inhibited androgen binding to AR, up to 50% at concentrations of approximately 0.5 uM for both compounds. The nuclear translocation of green fluorescent protein-AR fusion protein in the presence of DHT was promoted as the result of the addition of 2,4-D and DCP. Collectively, these results that 2,4-D and DCP enhanced DHT-induced AR transcriptional activity might be attributable, at least in part, to the promotion of AR nuclear translocation."

Toxicity to DCP was assessed by organ and body weight changes, histopathology, and effects on reproduction and immunocompetence. Reproductive parameters measured included conception, litter size, pup birth weight, number stillborn, survival to weaning, and weaning weight. Immune parameters assessed were humoral immunity (antibody production) by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cell-mediated immunity by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, and macrophage function by phagocytosis of radiolabeled blood cells. Rats that received the combined in utero and postnatal treatment with 300 ppm DCP had significantly increased liver and spleen weights, enhanced humoral immune responsiveness, and depressed cell-mediated immunity. Histopathologic changes were unremarkable in DCP-exposed rats, even in the presence of increased liver and spleen weights. The 6-wk-old progeny of DCP-treated dams had normal immune functions and showed no signs of DCP toxicity, other than increased spleen weights in the 300-ppm exposure group. The results indicate that (1) the immune system may be a sensitive target for chlorinated phenolic compounds, (2) DCP may exert different effects on separate major immune responses, and (3) unlike some other chlorinated phenols, DCP does not appear to alter reproductive performance in rats."

Evaluation of the chemicals based on gene function indicated that the genes related to proliferation, transcription and transport were mostly up-regulated while significant numbers of genes related to enzymes and signaling were down-regulated. The genes related to transcription showed the highest degree of variation among the six functional categories (enzymes, signaling, proliferation, transcription, transport and others) for the chemicals with relatively high levels of estrogenic activity.

Swiss mice were treated orally by gavage with 2,4-D at 1.7, 3.3 and 33 mg/kg bw (1/200, 1/100 and 1/10 of LD50). 2,4-DCP was intraperitoneally (ip) injected at 36, 72 and 180 mg/kg bw (1/10, 1/5, 1/2 of LD50). A significant increase in the percentage of chromosome aberrations in bone-marrow and spermatocyte cells was observed after oral administration of 2,4-D at 3.3 mg/kg bw for three and five consecutive days. This percentage increased and reached 10.8+/-0.87 (P<0.01) in bone-marrow and 9.8+/-0.45 (P<0.01) in spermatocyte cells after oral administration of 2,4-D at 33 mg/kg bw for 24 hr.

The PBN-radical adducts were detected in fish liver samples following treatments of 2,4-DCP (0.025, 0.05, 0.5, 5, or 25 mg/kg) 24 hr after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and 2,4-DCP (0.5 mg/kg) at 2, 4, 8, 24, or 72 hr after i.p. injection in Carassius auratus. The hyperfine splitting constants for the PBN-radical adducts are aN = 13.7 G, aH = 1.8 G, and g = 2.0058, which is consistent with those of PBN/hydroxyl radical (*OH). The results indicate that the hydroxyl radical is probably produced during acute intoxication of 2,4-DCP. The relative similarity in the kinetics (from 2 to 72 hr) of superoxide dismutase activity induction and *OH generation implies that the generation of *OH possibly depends on the superoxide anion (O2*-). Superoxide anion (O2*-) might be the precursor radical undergoing the Haber-Weiss reaction to form *OH. Possible pathways for radical chain reactions in the formation of the hydroxyl radical in vivo after 2,4-DCP administration are proposed. Other parameters with respect to antioxidant defense (e.g., superoxide dismutase and catalase) and oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation level) indicate that the fish were subjected to oxidative stress induced by 2,4-DCP and that the mechanisms of oxidative stress possibly involve the in vivo stimulation of hydroxyl radical formation."

Rats were exposed to 0, 3, 30, or 300 ppm DCP in drinking water either in utero or for 12 wk postnatally following in utero exposure. Toxicity to DCP was assessed by organ and body weight changes, histopathology, and effects on reproduction and immunocompetence. Reproductive parameters measured included conception, litter size, pup birth weight, number stillborn, survival to weaning, and weaning weight. Immune parameters assessed were humoral immunity (antibody production) by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cell-mediated immunity by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, and macrophage function by phagocytosis of radiolabeled blood cells. Rats that received the combined in utero and postnatal treatment with 300 ppm DCP had significantly increased liver and spleen weights, enhanced humoral immune responsiveness, and depressed cell-mediated immunity. Histopathologic changes were unremarkable in DCP-exposed rats, even in the presence of increased liver and spleen weights. The 6-wk-old progeny of DCP-treated dams had normal immune functions and showed no signs of DCP toxicity, other than increased spleen weights in the 300-ppm exposure group. ... The results indicate that (1) the immune system may be a sensitive target for chlorinated phenolic compounds, (2) DCP may exert different effects on separate major immune responses, and (3) unlike some other chlorinated phenols, DCP does not appear to alter reproductive performance in rats."
