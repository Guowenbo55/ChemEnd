            "content": "The study investigated the potential of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR), a brassinosteroid analogue, in enhancing phytoremediation of lead (Pb) stress in tall fescue plants. When exposed to Pb, a decrease in shoot and root biomass, as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid productions, was observed in tall fescue. However, foliar application of EBR at different rates mitigated these adverse effects, improving biomass and photosynthetic pigments. The enhanced Pb tolerance was associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and increased antioxidative enzyme activities. Notably, EBR application influenced the translocation of Pb within the plant, with a significant improvement in Pb recovery in both shoots and roots. The translocation factor, indicative of Pb movement from roots to shoots, was notably increased with the medium rate of EBR application. This finding suggests that EBR treatment has the potential to enhance the translocation of Pb within tall fescue plants, making it a promising candidate for phytoremediation strategies in Pb-contaminated soils. The study provides valuable insights into the physiological responses of tall fescue to EBR under Pb stress and underscores its potential application in sustainable phytoremediation practices.",
