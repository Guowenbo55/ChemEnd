    "Description": "Dimethomorph is a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-dimethomorph in an unspecified ratio. It is used as a systemic fungicide used on vines, potatoes, and greenhouse crops; only the Z isomer has fungicidal activity. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a mixture and a morpholine fungicide. It contains an (E)-dimethomorph and a (Z)-dimethomorph.",

However, little is known about dimethomorph residue levels in potatoes and the soil. This study developed a high-performance liquid chromatography method to accurately analyze dimethomorph. Linearity was established from 0.05 to 10.0 mg/L, with a recovery rate ranging from 76.61% to 109.11%. The limit of detection and quantification were 0.02 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. Potato production experiments in China's provinces revealed that dimethomorph applied via foliar spray was translocated to tubers within 2 days. Dimethomorph half-lives in potato leaves, tubers, and soil ranged from 2.65 to 4.20, 1.79 to 3.71, and 4.62 to 9.0 days, respectively. Dietary exposure risk assessments indicated that spraying dimethomorph at 1.5 times the recommended dosage poses little risk for potato consumption in these regions.",
