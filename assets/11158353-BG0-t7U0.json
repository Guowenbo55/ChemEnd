A fungicide used for foiliar application and as a seed treatment in order to control botrystis, powdery mildew and other diseases. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzamides, an organochlorine compound, a member of pyridines, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a benzamide fungicide.",

The QuEChERS method with LC-MS/MS was used for extraction and cleanup of samples, with LOD and LOQ of 1.5 \u03bcgkg\u22121 and 0.005 mg kg\u22121, respectively. Rapid uptake of the fungicides by both plants was observed from the first day, with major accumulation in tomato roots and in both bell pepper roots and leaves. Residue accumulation in fruits was lowest and well below MRLs, with maximum concentrations in tomato fruits of 0.060 mg kg\u22121 for fluopyram and 0.009 mg kg\u22121 for tebuconazole, and in bell pepper fruits of 0.080 mg kg\u22121 for fluopyram and 0.013 mg kg\u22121 for tebuconazole. In field soil, initial fluopyram residues were 3.18\u20133.570 mg kg\u22121 and dissipated with a half-life of 36 days, while tebuconazole concentrations were 1.57\u20131.892 mg kg\u22121 initially and dissipated with a half-life of 44.5\u201349.5 days. The major metabolite, fluopyram benzamide, was detected in plant tissues and soil, remaining within 12% of the parent compound.

It also examined the behavior of these pesticides during thermal processes ranging from 40\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C in two apple varieties. Gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed for analytical investigations. Variations in pesticide concentrations between the pulp and skin were observed depending on the apple variety. Pirimicarb showed the highest transfer to the pulp, while boscalid and deltamethrin remained predominantly on the skin. Surprisingly, boscalid was found to be more present in the apple skin than in the pulp. Drying and dry pasteurization processes were the most effective in reducing pesticide levels in apples with and without skin, respectively. Thermal processes resulted in processing factors ranging from 0.06 to 0.98 for ten pesticides, with acetamiprid being the only pesticide whose levels were not decreased. The study discussed the relationship between pesticide distribution, behavior, and physico-chemical properties, particularly water solubility. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pesticide efficacy and removal in apples.",
