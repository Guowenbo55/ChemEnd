Survival of male and females in all treated groups were comparable to controls. Females at 250 ppm exhibited increased survival when compared to control females. Decreases in bw (15-28%) were observed in males and females at 250 ppm throughout the 24 mo of treatment. Feed consumption was decreased in females at 50 ppm and both sexes at 250 ppm. There were no treatment-related changes in serum T3, T4 and TSH concentrations, urinalysis parameters, serum corticosterone concentrations, or hematology parameters when tested throughout the study. Serum triglycerides of both sexes at 250 ppm were consistently lower at all time intervals when compared to controls. This finding was considered secondary to reduced bw and feed consumption of this group. There were no other treatment related changes in any clinical chemistry parameters. Ophthalmologic examinations at 12 and 24 mo showed no indication of compound-related ocular disease at 250 ppm when compared to control. Increases in hepatic mixed function oxidase activity were observed in both sexes at 50 and 250 ppm after 3 and 12 mo of treatment. Increases in relative liver wt (9-31%) were observed in both sexes at 50 and 250 ppm. Gross pathology changes at necropsy were seen primarily in the liver (ie, prominent lobular architecture, focal discoloration) at 50 ppm and/or 250 ppm. An irregular or thickened appearance of the urinary bladder was seen in females at 250 ppm at 24 mo. Treatment related microscopic changes were observed in the liver in both sexes at 50 and 250 ppm at 3, 12, 18 and 24 mo. In adrenal glands of females at 50 ppm at 18 mo and in both sexes at 250 ppm at 3, 12, 18 and/or 24 mo; and in the urinary bladder of females at 250 ppm at 24 mo. The microscopic changes in the liver consisted predominantly of centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy which was frequently accompanied by an increased amount of centrilobular or midzonal hepatocellular vacuolation. Other treatment-related changes associated with the liver hypertrophy included increased incidences of multifocal or single-cell necrosis, focal eosinophilic cellular alterations or focal hepatocellular hyperplasia. The microscopic change in adrenal glands consisted of diffuse vacuolation of the adrenal cortical cells. The change in urinary bladder consisted of a low, but increased incidence of chronic cystitis. Dietary exposure to dicofol did not result in an increased incidence of neoplasms of any organ-system in any of the compound-treatment groups. The NOEL was therefore established at 5 ppm (0.22 mg/kg/day in males and 0.27 mg/kg/day in females)."

Dicofol produced no readily apparent consistent treatment-related effects on clinical signs, body weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology, hematology, urinalysis, body temperatures and heart rates. One male in the 180 ppm recovery group was found dead during week 28 and one additional 180 ppm recovery group male was sacrificed as moribund during week 42.  Cause of the death is unknown but is not thought to be due to dicofol, whereas general debilitation and long-standing whole-body skin changes unrelated to treatment with dicofol were considered to be the reason for necropsy of the moribund dog. Mean serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) was slightly but significantly elevated in 180 ppm males and several high dose females had elevated SAP values. Likewise, mean albumin values were decreased in 180 ppm males and females. These responses may be indicative of a compound related effect. Cortisol responses to ACTH injection were markedly reduced in 180 ppm males and females, but reduced responses at 13 weeks were partially (males) to near completely reversible (females) by week 25 and completely reversed at termination in the 180 ppm recovery group.

Evaluation of ECG tracings revealed no evidence of direct cardiotoxicity and all tracings were considered to be within normal limits. Mean hepatic weights of 180 ppm, but not 180 ppm recovery, males were increased compared to control males.

Dicofol, a miticide, has been widely cited as an endocrine disruptor, due to its close structural similarity to DDT and DDE, which have known estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic activity. However, there is currently no direct evidence that dicofol alters reproductive hormone function. This study was designed to provide a comprehensive functional assessment of the effects of dicofol on reproduction and development in rats following dietary exposure at concentrations of 5, 25 or 125 ppm. This study was designed in accordance with draft EPA guidelines for reproductive toxicity studies which have been expanded to increase the sensitivity to altered reproductive hormone function. Parental animals were exposed to dicofol for 10 weeks, mated, offspring delivered, and offspring exposure continued to sexual maturation. Evaluation included, general toxicity, reproductive performance and fertility, estrus cycling, sperm analysis, age at puberty in offspring, organ weights and histopathology. Dicofol and its metabolite were detected in parental serum, neonatal tissues, milk and weanling serum, demonstrating exposure in parental animals, and gestational and lactational exposure of offspring. There were no effects of dicofol exposure on reproduction and fertility, or on survival or growth of offspring. There were no effects on estrus cycling or sperm parameters, or on age at vaginal patency, or preputial separation in female and male offspring, respectively. There were no treatment-related effects on reproductive organ weights or histopathology at any dose. Liver weight was increased and histopathology of the liver was observed in both parental animals and offspring at 125 ppm. In conclusion, dicofol administration in the diet produced no functional effects indicative of reproductive endocrine disruption at doses which produced target organ toxicity."

With metabolic activation cells were exposed to the test compound for 2 hr at 37 \u00b0C. 0.1 ug/mL colcemid was added to all cultures 2.5 hours prior to harvesting the cells: At the time of the first metaphase after treatment with dicofol, cells were harvested, killed by swelling in hypotonic KC1 and fixed. Slides were prepared and 100 metaphase cells were scored for chromosomal aberrations from each of two cultures at each treatment concentration. In the assay without activation, chromosomal aberrations were evaluated at 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 ug/mL, the latter two concentrations being toxic. With activation chromosomal aberrations were evaluated at 7.5, 10, 15, 17.5, 20 and 22.5 ug/mL and concentrations greater than 15 ug/mL produced toxicity with limited numbers of metaphase cells available. No significant increase in cells with chromosomal aberrations occurred either with or without metabolic activation."

Two positive control groups (5 animals each) received a single 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg ip dose of triethylene melamine. These animals were killed 18 hours later and bone marrow slides prepared. All animals received colchicine (1 mg/kg, in distilled water ip) 3 hours prior to being killed.Bone marrow cells (50 metaphases/animal where available) from rats in the vehicle and positive control groups and from rats receiving 478 mg ai/kg were evaluated for chromosomal aberrations. A dose-related incidence of clinical signs (passivity, diarrhea, stain muzzle, red paws and ataxia at 478 mg ai/kg) were observed in all 3 treated groups. When compared to vehicle treated animals no significant increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed in the animals treated with 478 mg ai/kg. Slides from the lower dose groups were not examined because an effect was not seen at the high dose. A significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed in rats treated with the positive control compared to vehicle treated rats."

Other reported Koc values for dicofol are 7,207 in sand (0.2% organic matter, pH 6.5), 6,945 in sandy loam (1.6% organic matter, pH 5.8), 5,017 in silty loam (2.4% organic matter, pH 7.1), and 5,086 in clay loam (2.8% organic matter, pH 7.0)(2). Dicofol shows moderate to low mobility in batch equilibrium and column leaching studies, with little potential to leach to groundwater(3). In batch equilibrium studies, mobility of dicofol was moderate in sand (Koc of 5,868), and clay loam (Koc of 5,917) soil slurries(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that dicofol is expected to be immobile in soil."
