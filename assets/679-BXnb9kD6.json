After 12 hr the activity of plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and after 24 hr plasma GOT and GPT activities strongly increased. These results indicated that the necrotic process was initiated at about 12 hr and developed thereafter. By co-administration of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 18 and 1 hr before, and 8 hr after administration of thioacetamide: each time, 2.5 mL/kg body weight, p.o.), plasma GOT and GPT were significantly decreased and were even comparable to the control group, showing that DMSO totally prevented the necrotic action of thioacetamide. After 12 and 24 hr of thioacetamide administration, the hepatic level of vitamin C, the most sensitive chemical indicator of oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating that oxidative stress was significantly enhanced 12 hr after thioacetamide intoxication and thereafter. DMSO totally restored the liver vitamin C level, demonstrating that DMSO effectively ameliorated the oxidative stress caused by thioacetamide, resulting in the prevention of necrosis of the liver. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased transiently 12 hr after treatment with thioacetamide. These results indicated that oxidative stress and the activation of JNK took place almost simultaneously. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 was significantly increased 6-12 hr after thioacetamide injection. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) was significantly decreased 24 hr after administration of thioacetamide. DMSO treatment inhibited the change of these MAPKs by thioacetamide, corresponding with the prevention of the liver necrosis as well as the attenuation of oxidative stress."

            "Value": "Previous studies performed in our laboratory indicated that non-toxic concentrations of peroxynitrite nevertheless commit U937 cells to a rapid necrosis that is however prevented by a survival signaling driven by cytosolic phospholipase A(2)-released arachidonic acid. Toxicity was mediated by concentrations of peroxynitrite resulting in H(2)O(2)-dependent inhibition of arachidonic acid release. The present study shows that U937 cells differentiated to monocytes by prolonged exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide are resistant to peroxynitrite because able to respond with enhanced release of arachidonic acid. An additional important observation was that these cells require more arachidonate than the undifferentiated cells to support the survival signaling. The enhanced arachidonic acid release was not associated with changes in cytosolic phospholipase A(2) expression but was rather dependent on the increased responsiveness of the enzyme to calcium-dependent stimulation as well as on reduced mitochondrial formation of H(2)O(2). The latter event was found to be critical, since differentiated and undifferentiated cells were equally sensitive to peroxynitrite when the accumulation of H(2)O(2) was enhanced via depletion of catalase, or addition of a complex III inhibitor. Thus, the strategy selected by the differentiation process to allow monocytes to cope with peroxynitrite appears to involve some specific mechanism preventing the mitochondrial formation of H(2)O(2)."

However, the mechanisms by which DMSO mediates its therapeutic effects are unclear. /This paper/ investigated the capability of DMSO to up-regulate heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) expression, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DMSO induced HO-1 expression both at the level of mRNA and protein in dose-and time-dependent manners in HUVECs, resulting in increased HO-1 activity. The pharmacological inhibition of cJun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) blocked the DMSO-induced HO-1 up-regulation, while inhibition of extracellular regulated kinase and p38-MAPK did not block heme oxygenase-1 up-regulation. In addition, the phosphorylation of JNKs was initiated by DMSO, indicating the involvement of this kinase in the observed response. DMSO increased the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and enhanced its binding to the anti-oxidant response element. Inhibition of Nrf2 synthesis by small interfering RNA molecules subsequently inhibited HO-1 expression induced by DMSO, indicating DMSO's role in inducing HO-1 expression via Nrf2 activation. Utilizing these findings, the present study identified DMSO as a novel inducer of HO-1 expression and identified the underlying mechanisms involved in this process."

This article describes that DMSO, being non-toxic to the normal lymphocytes, up regulated TNFalpha and p53, declined Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activated caspase 9 and PARP-1 cleavage and produced apoptotic pattern of DNA ladder in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) in vivo. This was consistent with the declined expressions of tumor growth supportive glycolytic enzymes; inducible D-fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase and lactate dehydrogenase-5 in the DL cells. The findings suggest induction of TNFalpha-p53-mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by DMSO in a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and support evolving concept of glycolytic inhibition led apoptosis in a tumor cell in vivo."

The aim of this work is to explore DMSO's effects upon sleep/wake states. Twenty male rats were sterotaxically prepared for polysomnography. Four concentrations of DMSO (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, in saline) were examined. DMSO or saline were administered intraperitoneally at the beginning of the light period. Three hours of polygraphic recording were evaluated for stages of vigilance after treatment. Sleep/wake parameters and EEG power spectral analyses during sleep were investigated. Results show no significant effect after 5% or 10% DMSO treatment. DMSO 15% increased mean episode duration of light slow wave sleep (SWS), decreasing mean episode duration of deep SWS and of quiet wake (QW). DMSO 20% increased light SWS enhancing number of episodes, while decreased deep SWS mean episode duration. EEG power spectra of sigma and delta activity were also affected by DMSO. Therefore, DMSO at 15% and 20% affects sleep architecture in rats, increasing light SWS and reducing deep SWS.

However, only a few and sometimes contrasting data about the effects of DMSO in animal models of nociception and inflammation are presently available. /This study/ evaluated the effects induced by DMSO and a DMSO-containing saline on thermal and chemical nociception, inflammation and locomotor activity in CD1 mice. /It/ demonstrated that centrally or orally administered DMSO displayed anti-nociceptive effects to thermal (hot plate and tail-flick test) and chemical (formalin test) stimuli. Conversely, DMSO was able to increase both nociceptive phases in the formalin test when applied subcutaneously in the dorsal surface of the mouse hind paws 10 min before formalin administration. Oral administration of DMSO produced anti-inflammatory effects on zymosan-induced edema in the mouse paw, whereas local administration potentiated the inflammatory action exerted by zymosan. Oral and central, but not local, administration of DMSO improved the mouse locomotor activity. These results suggest that DMSO displayed opposite effects on nociception and inflammation, depending on the route of administration.

Clinical signs including mortality and evidence of abortion were checked daily. Food consumption and body weight were recorded at designated intervals during pregnancy. On day 20 of pregnancy, females were killed. The gravid uterus was weighed and fetuses removed by hysterectomy. Females were examined macroscopically. Litter parameters were recorded: number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, early and late resporptions, and dead and live fetuses. Fetuses were weighed, sexed, and submitted to external examination and then to soft tissue or skeletal examinations. Maternal data: There were no clinical signs observed in treated or control groups. No maternal deaths or abortions occurred in any group. Lower food consumption and body weight gain were noted in females of the 5000 mg/kg group. No macroscopic findings were noted at necropsy in any of the females. Litter data: Pre- and post-implantation losses were similar in all groups. No treatment-related effects were observed on the number of fetuses or the sex ratio. In the 5000 mg/kg/day group, fetal body weights were slightly lower than that of controls, an indirect consequence, at least in part, of decreased maternal food consumption and body weight gain. Fetal examination: No external malformations or anomalies were observed in fetuses from any group. An increased incidence of two soft tissues anomalies were observed: dilated renal pelvis for fetuses in all treated groups, which was associated at 5000 mg/kg/day with an increased incidence of dilated ureter(s). No treatment-related soft tissue malformations were observed. There were no treatment-related skeletal variations or malformations in any group. An increased incidence of reduced or delayed ossification of ribs was observed in fetuses of the 5000 mg/kg group. This skeletal anomaly is considered to be a consequence of the lowered fetal body weights observed for this group. No treatment-related microscopic changes were noted in the kidneys of fetuses with dilated renal pelvis. Dilation of the renal pelvis may be related to the diuretic properties of DMSO."

Experimental models of cerebral ischemia can be used to evaluate the cellular response phenomena and possible neurological protection by drugs.  OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cellular changes in the neuronal population and astrocytic response by the effect of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) on a model of ischemia caused by cerebral embolism.  METHODS: Twenty Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n= 5). The infarct was induced with alpha-bovine thrombin (40 NIH/Unit.). The treated group received 90 mg (100 microL) of DMSO in saline (1:1 v/v) intraperitoneally for 5 days; ischemic controls received only NaCl (placebo) and two non-ischemic groups (simulated) received NaCl and DMSO respectively. We evaluated the neuronal (anti-NeuN) and astrocytic immune-reactivity (anti-GFAP). The results were analyzed by densitometry (NIH Image J-Fiji 1.45 software) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Graph pad software (Prism 5).  RESULTS: Cerebral embolism induced reproducible and reliable lesions in the cortex and hippocampus (CA1), similar to those of focal models. DMSO did not reverse the loss of post-ischemia neuronal immune-reactivity, but prevented the morphological damage of neurons, and significantly reduced astrocytic hyperactivity in the somato-sensory cortex and CA1 (p <0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: The regulatory effect of DMSO on astrocyte hyperreactivity and neuronal-astroglial cytoarchitecture , gives it potential neuroprotective properties for the treatment of thromboembolic cerebral ischemia in the acute phase."

This study was designed to evaluate the possible neurotoxic effects of DMSO on the closer and distant brain tissue and carotid artery when it was slowly infused into the internal carotid arteries of the rats.  METHODS: The right common carotid artery bifurcation was exposed through a midline neck incision, and then except those of the control group animals (n=5), the experimental material (normal saline, n=5 or anhydrous DMSO, n=10) was infused into the internal carotid artery of the Wistar albino rats. After the experimental materials were administered intra-arterially, brain tissues were harvested for histopathological and biochemical studies at 72 hr for investigation of the acute stage changes and on 10th day for investigation of the chronic stage changes. Internal carotid arteries of both sides were also removed for histopathological evaluation. During sacrification of the rats, whole body blood of them are collected for biochemical evaluation.  RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding comparison of the mean values of the hippocampal neuronal cell counts and the carotid artery diameters in both acute and chronic stages.

Although DMSO is generally thought of as being relatively inert, it can induce biological effects that are often overlooked. An example that highlights this potential problem is found in a recent report demonstrating a pathogenic role for natural killer T (NKT) and natural killer (NK) cells in acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI) in C57Bl/6 mice in which DMSO was used to facilitate acetaminophen (APAP) dissolution. We report that NKT and NK cells do not play a pathologic role in AILI in C57Bl/6 mice in the absence of DMSO. Although AILI was significantly attenuated in mice depleted of NKT and NK cells prior to APAP treatment in the presence of DMSO, no such effect was observed when APAP was dissolved in saline. Because of this unexpected finding, the effects of DMSO on hepatic NKT and NK cells were subsequently investigated. When given alone, DMSO activated hepatic NKT and NK cells in vivo as evidenced by increased NKT cell numbers and higher intracellular levels of the cytotoxic effector molecules interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granzyme B in both cell types. Similarly, when used as a solvent for APAP, DMSO again increased NKT cell numbers and induced IFN-gamma and granzyme B expression in both cell types.

Addition of DMSO (0.02%-1.0%) to EBs in culture induced an increase in Dnmt3a mRNA levels with increasing dosage. Increased expression of two subtypes of Dnmt3a in protein levels was confirmed by Western blotting. Southern blot analysis revealed that DMSO caused hypermethylation of two kinds of repetitive sequences in EBs. Furthermore, restriction landmark genomic scanning, by which DNA methylation status can be analyzed on thousands of loci in genic regions, revealed that DMSO affected DNA methylation status at multiple loci, inducing hypomethylation as well as hypermethylation depending on the genomic loci.

It is therefore important to establish the cellular and molecular targets of DMSO in order to differentiate its intrinsic effects from those elicited by a compound of interest. /This study/ performed a genome-wide functional screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify deletion mutants exhibiting sensitivity to 1% DMSO, a concentration standard to yeast chemical profiling studies. ... Mutants defective in Golgi/ER transport are sensitive to DMSO, including those lacking components of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex.

            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ A significant increase in lymphocyte apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL method in the thymus, spleen, and Peyer's patches (PP) following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (treatment, n = 47; control, n = 8). Interestingly, administration of low doses of DMSO caused apoptosis in only the PP, and suggested that i.p. administration of DMSO induced apoptosis for each lymphoid organ in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, in the early stage during the apoptotic change, a characteristic localization of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis was observed. Briefly, early apoptosis occurred predominantly in the cortical mid-zone of the thymus, white pulp of the spleen, and germinal centers of PP. With increased time following administration, however, lymphocytes throughout lymphoid tissues, independent of characteristic localization during the early stage, seemed to undergo apoptosis, resulting in the severe loss of lymphocytes. In fact, the relative spleen weight significantly decreased at 24 hr following DMSO administration (n = 7; P < 0.001 versus 8 control mice). Taken together, these results showed for the first time that the in vivo administration of DMSO to mice caused apoptosis in lymphoid organs, and also demonstrated that the apoptotic behavior varied between different lymphoid organs."

This represented doses of 8-10 g/kg/day of DMSO and 6-8 g/kg/day of DMS02. Both compounds were observed  to extend the mean life span of MRL/Ipr mice from 5.5 months to over 10 months of age. All strains  showed decreased antinuclear antibody responses and significant diminution of lymphadenopathy,  splenomegaly, and anemia development. Serum IgG levels and spleen IgM antibody plaque formation,  however, did not differ from control values. There was no indication of involvement of systemic  immunosuppressive or antiproliferative effects, and treated animals were observed to remain healthy  and vigorous with no signs of toxicity. These results demonstrate that high doses of both DMSO and  its major in vivo metabolite, DMSO2, provide significant protection against the development of  murine autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease."

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of DMSO on contraction, on Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments, and on myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation were investigated in both intact and alpha-toxin-permeabilized strips of rabbit detrusor muscle. KEY RESULTS: In fura-PE3-loaded strips, DMSO (>1%) induced a significant relaxation during sustained contractions induced by 60 mM K+-depolarization or 10 microM carbachol, while having no effect on the [Ca2+](i) level. DMSO decreased the level of MLC phosphorylation during the contractions induced by 60 mM K+ and 10 microM carbachol. DMSO also inhibited both the contraction and MLC phosphorylation induced by calyculin-A in intact strips. In the alpha-toxin-permeabilized preparations, DMSO relaxed the Ca2+-induced contraction and also inhibited the tension development induced by a stepwise increment of Ca2+ concentrations. Such a relaxant effect of DMSO was enhanced in the presence of phosphate.  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DMSO relaxes rabbit detrusor muscle by decreasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments. Inhibition of the kinase activities involved in myosin phosphorylation may play a major role in DMSO-induced Ca2+ desensitization. Inhibition of the cross-bridge cycling at the step of phosphate release may also contribute to the relaxant effect of DMSO. Such relaxant effects of DMSO could be linked to the therapeutic effect of DMSO in interstitial cystitis."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ INTRODUCTION: Dimethyl sulfoxide is an amphiphilic compound whose miscibility with water and its ability to dissolve lipophilic compounds make it an appreciated solvent in biomedical research. However, its reported antioxidant properties raise doubts about its use as a solvent in evaluating new antioxidants. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate its antioxidant properties and carry out a comparative study on the antioxidant properties of some known neuroprotective antioxidants in the presence and absence of dimethyl sulfoxide.  METHODS: The antioxidant properties of dimethyl sulfoxide were studied in rat brain homogenates by determining its ability to reduce both lipid peroxidation (TBARS formation) and protein oxidation (increase in protein carbonyl content and decrease in free thiol content) induced by ferrous chloride/hydrogen peroxide. Its ability to reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals by 6-hydroxydopamine autoxidation was also estimated. The same study was also performed with three known antioxidants (alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone; 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane; 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) in the presence and absence of dimethyl sulfoxide.  RESULTS: /These/ results showed that dimethyl sulfoxide is able to reduce both lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation induced by ferrous chloride/hydrogen peroxide in rat brain homogenates. It can also reduce the production of hydroxyl radicals during 6-hydroxydopamine autoxidation. However, it increases the oxidation of protein thiol groups caused by ferrous chloride/hydrogen peroxide in rat brain homogenate.  DISCUSSION: Despite the here reported antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of dimethyl sulfoxide, the results obtained with alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane, and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide corroborate the antioxidant properties attributed to these compounds and support the potential use of dimethyl sulfoxide as a solvent in the study of the antioxidant properties of lipophilic compounds.  CONCLUSION: Dimethyl sulfoxide is a very useful solvent that may be used at relatively low concentrations in the development of new antioxidants with neuroprotective properties."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Thioacetamide (400 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) was administered to rats. After 12 hr the activity of plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and after 24 hr plasma GOT and GPT activities strongly increased. These results indicated that the necrotic process was initiated at about 12 hr and developed thereafter. By co-administration of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 18 and 1 hr before, and 8 hr after administration of thioacetamide: each time, 2.5 mL/kg body weight, p.o.), plasma GOT and GPT were significantly decreased and were even comparable to the control group, showing that DMSO totally prevented the necrotic action of thioacetamide. After 12 and 24 hr of thioacetamide administration, the hepatic level of vitamin C, the most sensitive chemical indicator of oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating that oxidative stress was significantly enhanced 12 hr after thioacetamide intoxication and thereafter. DMSO totally restored the liver vitamin C level, demonstrating that DMSO effectively ameliorated the oxidative stress caused by thioacetamide, resulting in the prevention of necrosis of the liver. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased transiently 12 hr after treatment with thioacetamide. These results indicated that oxidative stress and the activation of JNK took place almost simultaneously. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 was significantly increased 6-12 hr after thioacetamide injection. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) was significantly decreased 24 hr after administration of thioacetamide. DMSO treatment inhibited the change of these MAPKs by thioacetamide, corresponding with the prevention of the liver necrosis as well as the attenuation of oxidative stress."

However, its apoptotic mechanism remains unexplored in in vivo tumors. This article describes that DMSO, being non-toxic to the normal lymphocytes, up regulated TNFalpha and p53, declined Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activated caspase 9 and PARP-1 cleavage and produced apoptotic pattern of DNA ladder in Dalton's lymphoma (DL) in vivo. This was consistent with the declined expressions of tumor growth supportive glycolytic enzymes; inducible D-fructose-6-phosphate-2-kinase and lactate dehydrogenase-5 in the DL cells. The findings suggest induction of TNFalpha-p53-mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by DMSO in a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and support evolving concept of glycolytic inhibition led apoptosis in a tumor cell in vivo."
