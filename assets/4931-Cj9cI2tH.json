            "Value": "AEROBIC: Propachlor degraded about 33 times faster in a non-sterilized silt soil than the sterilized soil leading to the conclusion that microbial transformation is the major degradation pathway for propachlor(1). The degradation proceeds via microbial hydrolysis with the formation of hydroxypropachlor or N-isopropylaniline(2,7). The hydrolyzed products may form conjugated compounds with active soil sites and may remain strongly sorbed to these active sites(2,6). Identified propachlor metabolites in soil are N-isopropylaniline, N-isopropylanilide, N-(1-hydroxy-isopropyl)acetanilide and N-isopropyl-2-acetoxyacetanilide(3). In addition to degradation via cometabolism, propachlor also mineralizes in soil(4). Soil suspensions mineralized 0.6-63% of ring-labeled propachlor to carbon dioxide in 30 days(4). It was suggested that mineralization is the major means for destruction of propachlor in soil(4). Increase in moisture content and temperature of soil enhanced the biodegradation of propachlor(5). At high concn (500 mg/kg), the biodegradation of propachlor was relatively slower compared to lower concn(6)."

Registrant's data for Alachlor show binding of the DEBQI metabolite to rat nasal protein at doses which deplete hepatic glutathione and which cause nasal tumors, supporting a non-genotoxic mode of action for nasal tumorigenicity. Data for Acetochlor also show binding of the corresponding dialkyl-benzoquinone imine at a dose that produces nasal tumors in S-D rats. Independent studies ...  have presented direct evidence for the in vivo production of benzoquinone imine metabolites from Acetochlor, Alachlor, Butachlor and Metolachlor in male S-D rats. In the case of Propachlor, the N-acetyl derivative of the 4-aminophenol derivative and its glucuronide were found in urine of rats dosed orally with Propachlor. Data in the literature indicate that N-acetyl- 4-aminophenol can be activated to a benzoquinone imine and has been found to cause necrosis in rat and human liver. In the case of propachlor, although it does not form nasal turbinate tumors, the 4-aminophenol precursor of the benzoquinonone imine has been identified as a metabolite."

            "Value": "Mechanistic studies of thyroid follicular cell tumorigenesis performed with Alachlor indicate a hormonally-mediated mechanism for thyroid neoplasia. Administration of Alachlor results in induction of microsomal hepatic UDPGT activity, which produces increased clearance of thyroid hormone, T4. Decreased levels of T4 would result in increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Increased levels of TSH would result in the hyperplastic and eventually tumorigenic response of the thyroid. ... For Propachlor, thyroid C-cell tumors have been observed after chronic high dose administration of the compound. However, as C cells are engaged in calcitonin production and not T3/T4 production, the mechanism of induction for these tumors is expected to be different."

The anemia was less evident in high-dose males and was only present in high-dose females at study termination. Significantly reduced lymphocyte counts were observed at week 6 for high-dose males and mid- and high-dose females, and at study termination for all groups. Levels of serum enzymes (SGPT, SAP, GGT), cholesterol and total bilirubin were significantly increased for high-dose animals at weeks 6 and 13 and there were significant reductions in total protein, glucose, creatinine and albumin. No histological changes were observed in the liver. Organ weights (with the exception of female livers) were reduced, relative to controls, for high-dose animals, and spleens were extremely small and treatment-related in size in about 65% of the animals. No histological changes were observed in the tissues examined, which included the spleen."

Dermal application of propachlor at dose levels of 25 and 50 mg/kg to the skin of white rats (two groups of 12 animals) for 90 days did not provoke any changes in concentrations of red blood cells and hemoglobin, but there were decreases in SGOT, SGPT, LAP, AP and catalase. Decreased sulfur-containing enzymes were found in tissue homogenates (liver and kidney). Decreases in the levels of LDH, SDH, AcP and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined histochemically. There was no evidence of clinical signs of intoxication after repeated dermal application of the herbicide, but the occurrence of the above-mentioned enzymatic changes demonstrated the penetration of this herbicide through the dermal barrier.

The results were evaluated for mitotic index (based on at least 1000 cells per animal) and 60 cells per animal were examined for chromosomal aberrations. Chromatid and isochromatid gaps were recorded for each cell, but these were not considered chromosomal aberrations. The results showed that propachlor does not induce chromosomal damage in male or female Fischer-344 rats under the conditions used in this study."

Animals were subjected to a single intragastric administration of pesticide at 0.2 to 0.5 LD50. Ramrod (propachlor) was found to significantly increase the frequency of chromosome aberrations. Ramrod was the most dangerous of the chemicals tested with the highest cytogenetic effect (4.5%) which exceeded the control level 3 fold."
