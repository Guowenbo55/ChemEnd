In all animals, moderate to severe erythema and slight edema were found after 1 hour and persisted until 72 and 48 hours, respectively. Mean scores for erythema were 3.0 (24 hr), 3.0 (48 hr), and 2.3 (72 hr), and for edema 1.3 (24 hr), 0.67 (48 hr), and 0.33 (72 hr). No changes were noted in the cornea and iris. All effects were completely reversible by day 7 after exposure except for 1 animal which still showed slight conjunctival redness."
