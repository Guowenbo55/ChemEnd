Foliage spray, the most common method, has drawbacks such as evaporation and drift. By studying pesticide absorption and conductivity and selecting suitable pesticides for root application, the adverse effects of environmental factors on pesticide ingredients can be reduced. The results suggest that tricyclazole is best suited for root application, showing superior upward transmission in rice seedlings compared to the other fungicides. This research provides guidance for pesticide selection for root application and contributes to the scientific use of pesticides.",
