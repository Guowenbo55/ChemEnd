However, in a study designed to identify the effects of nicotine on some human oral bacterial species, it was determined that nicotine neither stimulates nor reduces growth(2). Nicotine was degraded very slowly by an isolate, Arthriobacter globiformis, from cigar tobacco leaves (var.

Although nicotine has similar dose-related effects at the myoneural (neuromuscular) junction, rapidly developing skeletal muscle paralysis obscures the stimulant phase. The muscle-relaxant properties of nicotine may be mediated through stimulation of Renshaw cells and pulmonary afferent nerves, which results in inhibition of skeletal muscle motor activity; such relaxant effects may contribute to the behavior-reinforcing effects of the drug. Small doses of nicotine directly stimulate sympathetic ganglia and facilitate neurotransmission; however, large doses produce initial ganglionic stimulation, which is quickly followed by inhibition of neurotransmission."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ ... Previously /it has been noted/ that a single dose of nicotine elevates plasma adrenocorticotropin levels in rats and has a biphasic effect on plasma prolactin. The stimulatory effect of nicotine on these stress-responsive hormones desensitizes after a single injection of nicotine. Continuous exposure to nicotine also induces tolerance to its locomotor depressive and hypothermic effects, which have been associated with an increase of central (3)H-nicotine binding. Thus, the acute and chronic administration of nicotine might induce changes in central nicotinic cholinergic circuits that affect the adrenocorticotropin and prolactin responses to stress. In the present study, a single dose of nicotine (0.75-3.0 mg/kg body weight) significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma prolactin due to restraint stress initiated 60 min afterward. Five injections of nicotine during 1 day produced a similar attenuation of the prolactin response to restraint stress but neither of these paradigms affected adrenocorticotropin. In contrast, intermittent delivery of nicotine for 7 days failed to affect the prolactin response to restraint stress; however, after withholding nicotine for 14 hr, high dose nicotine attenuated the prolactin response to stress, whereas low dose nicotine remained ineffective. On the other hand, administration of the same schedule of low dose nicotine did significantly diminish the expected release of prolactin in response to a final injection of nicotine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg body weight) in unstressed animals."

The adult pattern of regional selectivity of binding capabilities, namely, midbrain plus brainstem > cerebral cortex much greater than cerebellum, was not present at birth, but rather developed over the ensuing 3 wk postpartum. Fetal exposure to nicotine produced an elevation in binding detectable during the course of drug exposure (gestational day 18), a finding similar to that of nicotine's effects in mature brain.

An unusual case is the death of a dog which consumed a package of cigarettes."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to 1 ml serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium in the presence or absence of nicotine (10-9 to 10-5 M). Nicotine incr plasminogen activator secretion, determined by (125)I-fibrin plate assay, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At all points, nicotine treatment (2.5 x 10-7 M) was associated with enhanced secretion of plasminogen activator activity. Maximum effects after 24 hr incubation were observed at 10-8 M nicotine, which corresponded to about a 2.6-fold incr over control. Nicotine (10-8 M) plasminogen activator stimulation required both RNA and protein syntheses, as evidenced by its inhibition (35%) by 2 ug/ actinomycin D and 2 ug/l cycloheximide. Although activities of all species of plasminogen activator were enhanced by nicotine, it had no significant effects on the release of plasminogen activator."

            "Value": "The Koc of nicotine is estimated as 100(SRC), using a log Kow of 1.17(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that nicotine is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKb1 of nicotine is 6.16(4), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Adsorption of nicotine, under more acidic conditions, can be represented as a high-affinity type isotherm, indicating that nicotine has a high affinity for humic acids in soil as a result of protonation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen atom of nicotine(6)."
