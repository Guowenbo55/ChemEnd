    "Description": "Thifensulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfur atom is attached to a 2-carboxythiophen-3-yl group and in which the non-sulfonated nitrogen is substituted by a 4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. The corresponding methyl ester, known as thifensulfuron-methyl, is used as a post-emergence herbicide for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. It has a role as a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of 1,3,5-triazines and a thiophenecarboxylic acid.",

Velvetleaf control and soybean injury increased as rates of thifensulfuron increased (0, 2.2, 4.4, and 5.8 g ai/ha) and as rates of chlorimuron increased (0, 4.4, and 8.8 g ai/ha). Treatments that included 28% UAN at 9 L/ha controlled velvetleaf 9% better, averaged across herbicides and rates 21 days after treatment (DAT), but also increased soybean injury. Thifensulfuron applications controlled common lambsquarters well, but control was not affected by additions of 28% UAN. In studies where 14C-thifensulfuron was applied without an additive to the second true leaf of growth-chamber-grown velvetleaf, less than 4% of that applied was absorbed 84 h after treatment (HAT), whereas treatments that included nonionic surfactant or 28% UAN absorbed 33 and 45%, respectively. When both nonionic surfactant and 28% UAN were added, plants absorbed 76% 84 HAT. Translocation 84 HAT was also greatest with both additives and the majority moved to tissues above treated leaves. The 28% UAN increased uptake of thiameturon regardless of soil fertility level.",
