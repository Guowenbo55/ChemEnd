Tissue samples samples were collected between March 2001 and March 2010 from dead stranded, captive, and free-ranging seals. Analysis revealed ciguatoxin activity in brain, liver, and muscle, whereas analysis of blood samples from 55 free-ranging animals revealed detectable levels of ciguatoxin activity (0.43 to 5.49 pg/mL P-CTX-1 equiv) in 19% of the animals. Of a total of 68 seals, eleven tested positive of ciguatoxin; the highest concentrations were found in animals from Midway. Blood samples from the 10 dead stranded seals were below the limit of quantitation; however the toxin was detected in 3 animals for which tissues were available(1)."

            "Value": "Ciguatoxin has been isolated from eels(1), including moray eels (Gymnothorax javanicus) from the Johnston Atoll, Hawaii(2). Marine eels (Muraenidae, Congridae and Ophichthidae) and in particular Muranidae, are generally considered the most toxic fish in regions where ciguatera occurs. On the island of Hawaii, herbivorous fish (Stenochaetus hawaiienis or C. strigosus) and carnivorous fish (Cephalopholis argus) were found to test positive for ciguatoxin. Seriola ravoliana or S. dumerlii from the northwest Hawaii region also tested positive(2)."

            "Value": "Ciguatera in humans is typically caused by the consumption of reef fish that have accumulated ciguatoxins (CTXs) in their flesh. Over a six month period, we captured 38 wild adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), a species commonly associated with ciguatera in The Bahamas. We sampled three tissues (i.e., muscle, liver, and blood) and analyzed them for the presence of ciguatoxins using a functional in vitro N2A bioassay. Detectable concentrations of ciguatoxins found in the three tissue types ranged from 2.51 to 211.74 pg C-CTX-1 equivalents/g. Blood and liver toxin concentrations were positively correlated (p = 0.86, P = 0.003), indicating that, for the first time, blood sampling provides a non-lethal method of detecting ciguatoxin in wild fish. Non-lethal blood sampling also presents opportunities to couple this approach with biotelemetry and biologging techniques that enable the study of fish distribution and movement. To demonstrate the potential for linking ciguatoxin occurrence with barracuda spatial ecology, we also present a proof-of-concept case study where blood samples were obtained from 20 fish before releasing them with acoustic transmitters and tracking them in the coastal waters using a fixed acoustic telemetry array covering 44 sq km. Fish that tested positive for CTX may have smaller home ranges than non-toxic fish (median distance travelled, U = 2.21, P = 0.03). Results presented from this study may help identify high risk areas and source-sink dynamics of toxins, potentially reducing the incidence and human health risk of ciguatera fish poisoning. Moreover, development of the non-lethal sampling approach and measurement of ciguatera from blood provide future opportunities to understand the mechanistic relationship between toxins and the spatial ecology of a broad range of marine fish species."

            "Value": "Ciguatoxin is the main toxin involved in ciguatera fish poisoning. It is produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus and accumulates in large piscivorous fishes. Ciguatoxin increases the membrane permeability to Na+ ions of excitable tissues by opening the voltage-dependent Na+ channel. Ciguatoxin binds to the Na+ channel at a binding site that is different from all other toxin binding sites previously recognized. This action accounts for the neurotoxicity of the compound. Brevetoxins also act specifically on voltage-dependent Na+ channels; their site of action is identical to the site of action of ciguatoxin."
