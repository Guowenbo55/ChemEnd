It is usual to divide them under 3 headings: muscarinic, nicotinic & central. Muscarinic signs ... consist of hypersalivation, lacrimation, sweating & nasal discharge. Miosis, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea & frequency of urination ... Nicotinic effects consist of fasciculation of muscles, weakness & paralysis. Central nervous system effects include nervousness, apprehension, ataxia, convulsions & coma. Death is due to resp failure, or sometimes cardiac arrest. There is little difference between signs produced by different organophosphorus compounds, but route of absorption may influence one system more than another. /Organophosphorus cmpd/"
