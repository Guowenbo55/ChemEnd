In 4 months, 16% of recovered ~4C-activity was translocated to the new shoots. Most of the ~4C-activity remained in the rootstock. Chromatographic evaluation of shoot extracts demonstrated that the ~4C-activity associated with uniconazole decreased 49% in 4 months. However, shoot growth was still inhibited which suggests that the amount of uniconazole that was degraded did not interfere with the inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis, probably due to the continuous translocation of uniconazole that occurred.",
