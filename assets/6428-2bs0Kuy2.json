As organic solvents, 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCE), trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, m-xylene and trichloro-trifluoroethane (FC-113) were used in this study. Each solvent was separately inhaled for a period of approximately 2 min. In the acute inhalation experiments, peak dp/dt that was the maximal left ventricular dp/dt decreased following inhalation of each organic solvent. The threshold concentration of 1,1,1-TCE, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, m-xylene and FC-113 required to decrease peak dp/dt was approximately 0.2%, 0.15%, 0.2%, 0.38%, 0.35% and 0.35%, respectively. These results indicated that the decrease in peak dp/dt was induced following inhalation of each solvent, but threshold concentration of the solvents to produce decrease in peak dp/dt was different. Inhalation of organic solvents of higher concentrations markedly decrease peak dp/dt. A dose response relationship was observed between decrease in peak dp/dt and concentration of the solvent greater than the threshold level. The degree of decrease in peak dp/dt following inhalation differed by kind of solvents with the greatest decrease in peak dp/dt being induced by tetrachloroethylene inhalation."

Body weight, appearance and behavior, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalyses) were monitored regularly. Selected rats were sacrificed and necropsied at 12 and 24 months. There were no clinical signs of toxicity; however males and females exposed at 20,000 ppm and females exposed at 10,000 ppm experienced a 5% to 10% decrease in body weight that was statistically significant. Males exposed at 20,000 ppm showed a slight transient increase in serum glucose. Primary nasal tumors were found in one male that inhaled 20,000 ppm and in three males and one female exposed at 10,000 ppm. The nasal tumors were identified as an adenoma, an undifferentiated sarcoma, and early sarcoma, a carcinoid-like neoplasm, and a papilloma. In female rats exposed at 20,000 ppm, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence (5.9%) of pancreatic islet cell adenomas compared to that in the concurrent controls. Because the nasal tumors found in the treated rats were of various morphological types and the incidences were not dose-related, the authors concluded that the occurrence of this type of tumor was not related to CFC-113 exposure. Additionally, because the incidence of pancreatic islet cell adenomas in the females exposed at 20,000 ppm was \"within the anticipated incidence of this finding among untreated Cf1:CD(SD)BR rats,\" this finding was not considered related to CFC-113 exposure. The authors concluded that CFC-113 did not induce any significant toxic or carcinogenic effects in rats after 2 years or exposure.
