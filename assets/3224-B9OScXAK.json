There was no treatment-related effect on the live birth, viability or lactation indices. For the developmental landmarks, the preputial separation was delayed for the male pups in the 150 and 400 ppm groups (0: 44.9 days vs. 150: 47.1 and 400: 46.8 days, (p<0.05). The time to vaginal opening for the females pups was not affected in a dose-related manner. The sperm motility, count and morphology of the male pups were not affected by the treatment. No treatment-related effects were noted in the FOB for either the dams or the pups. The motor activity assessment of the pups did not reveal any treatment-related effects. The auditory startle response, passive avoidance learning and memory and water maze learning and memory assessments did not indicate any treatment-related effects on the pups. No neuropathological lesions were noted in either the 21-day old pups or the 70-day old adults. Morphometric analysis of the brain of these animals did not demonstrate any treatment-related effects. No adverse effect indicated. Maternal NOEL: < 3.74 mg/kg/day (based upon lower mean body weights and lower food consumption demonstrated by the 50 ppm dams); Developmental NOEL: < 3.74 mg/kg/day (based upon the lower mean body weights of the offspring in the 50 ppm group); Developmental Neurotoxicity NOEL: 29.8 mg/kg/day (based upon the lack of a neurologically-related effect noted in the offspring at the highest dose tested)."

            "Value": "Endosulfan sorption was significantly greater in the largest (>63 um) particle size fraction than in the smaller (<5 um and 5-24 um) fractions for two field-contaminated sediment samples, and two laboratory-spiked sediment samples(1). In a static laboratory sediment test, the beta-isomer remained strongly sorbed to the sediment while the alpha-isomer desorbed, resulting in the formation of endosulfan sulfate in the water column(1). Endosulfan sulfate was the dominant compound measured in the total endosfulan of bottom sediment and in situ passive samplers collected from the Namoi River, in Australia, after land runoff events(1). The calculated rates of adsorption for alpha- and beta-endosulfan varied from 2.32 to 0.640 and 1.267 to 0.400 mg/g hr-1/2 in clayey soil to sandy soil, respectively(2)."
