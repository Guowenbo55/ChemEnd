Four groups, each consisting of 45 male and 45 female B6C3F1 mice, were exposed to dicyclopentadiene vapor by inhalation 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (64 exposures) at targeted concentrations of 0, 1.0, 5.0, or 50 ppm. An assessment of toxicity is carried out after 2, 6, and 13 weeks of inhalation exposures. Additionally, animals were evaluated during the recovery period of 4 or 13 weeks after the last exposure. Observations and measurements to assess toxicity include clinical observations, body weight, organ weights, serum chemistry, and hematologic, ophthalmologic, gross pathologic, and histologic evaluations. The only systemic effects observed were a few statistically significant changes in organ weights; but these were considered spurious in nature. Ten male and nine female mice in the highest exposure group died during the study, while no more than two mice died in any other group. However, the excess mortality was without an apparent etiology or association to exposure and was attributed to pulmonary congestion as a consequence of pulmonary irritation. Under the conditions of this study, these data demonstrated that in the absence of overt systemic toxicity, respiratory congestion has the predominant effect at the exposure levels of 50 ppm. This observation contributes to the Globally Harmonized System harmonized hazard classification of Single Target Organ Toxicity - Single Exposure (H335, may cause respiratory irritation) for this substance."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Dicyclopentadiene (DCP), was evaluated for reproductive toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats using the Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding Protocol (NTP, 1989). DCP is used in pesticides, fuel additives and adhesives and was selected for study because of its presence in the environment and lack of reproductive toxicity data. DCP was administered by gavage in corn oil at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg to animals that were housed individually for one week and then cohabitated for 16 weeks (20 animals/sex/group). Newborn litters were euthanized after evaluation on postnatal day (PND) 1. Litters born after Week 17 were reared until PND 21 and selected weanlings were administered the same dose levels as their respective parents. On PND 81 +/- 10, F1 animals were cohabitated within groups for one week and necropsied following delivery of the litters. Reproductive toxicity was observed in the 100 mg/kg group females: 28% fewer F1 pups born live, 8% lower adjusted live F1 pup weights, higher F1 pup mortality, increased cumulative days to litter, and decreased F1 pup survival in the final litter. At 30 mg/kg there was a 4% decrease in the female pup weight. At the crossover mating, pup weight was reduced (9%), in the DCP-treated females, while no effects were observed in litters from DCP-treated males. At necropsy, DCP caused a 2%, 7%, and 17% increase in liver weights and a 16%, 15%, and 16% increase in kidney weights in males from the 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg groups, respectively. Microscopically, an increase in the incidence of clear cell foci was observed in the livers of 30 and 100 mg/kg rats. In the second generation, DCP at 100 mg/kg caused a 12% reduction in F2 pup weight in the presence of increased F1 liver and kidney weights. The reproductive effects of DCP were not greater than those observed in the first generation. Thus, DCP is a reproductive toxicant, but not selectively so, as there were systemic toxicities at and below reproductively toxic dose levels."

Our prepared antibody reacted specifically with alpha(2u)-globulin in both immunohistochemical and Western blotting analyses, furthermore, and the graded immuno-reactivities on the slide were well associated with computational image analyzing results. Using this method, we retrospectively analyzed the renal sections from the toxicity studies of 12 nephrotoxic chemicals, which had already been conducted under the Japanese Existing Chemicals Survey Program. We demonstrated that the hyaline droplets induced by treatment with 10 chemicals (1,4-dibromobenzene, dicyclopentadiene, 3,4-dimethylaniline, 1,4-dicyanobenzene, tetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide, 1,3-dicyanobenzene, acenaphthene, 3,4-dichloro-1-butene, 3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-indene and 3,5,5-trimethylhexan-1-ol) were directly associated with alpha(2u)-globulin accumulation. This immunohistochemical method is convenient for applying, even retrospectively, paraffin sections from general toxicity studies and could be useful for qualifying male rat-specific hyaline droplets consisting of alpha(2u)-globulin and renal risk in humans."
