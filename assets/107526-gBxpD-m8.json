We also previously demonstrated that dietary carbohydrates play critical roles in this process. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of refeeding with different carbohydrate sources. Mice were fasted for 46 hr and then refed with 1.5% (w/w) agar gel containing 19% carbohydrate (sources: alpha-cornstarch, glucose, sucrose, or fructose). The liver expression of inflammatory and other specific genes was then sequentially measured for the first 14 hr after refeeding initiation. Fasting for 46 hr up-regulated the liver expression of endogenous ligands for TLRs (HspA5, Hsp90 aa1, and Hspd1). Refeeding with agar gel containing alpha-cornstarch or glucose increased the liver expression of Tlr2, proinflammatory genes (Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, RelB, Sectm1alpha, Il1beta), stress response genes (Atf3, Asns, Gadd45 a, Perk, Inhbe), detoxification genes (Hmox1, Gsta1, Abca8b), genes involved in tissue regeneration (Gdf15, Krt23, Myc, Tnfrsf12a, Mthfd2), and genes involved in tumor suppression (p53, Txnrd1, Btg2). This refeeding also moderately but significantly elevated the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. These effects were attenuated in mice refed with agar gel containing sucrose or fructose. Dietary glucose, rather than fructose, plays a critical role in refeeding-induced acute liver inflammatory gene expression and moderate hepatocyte destruction."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether maternal diabetes and high glucose in vitro induce DNA damage and DDR in the developing embryo through oxidative stress. In vivo experiments were conducted by mating superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) transgenic male mice with wild-type (WT) female mice with or without diabetes. Embryonic day 8.75 (E8.75) embryos were tested for the DNA damage markers, phosphorylated histone H2A.X (p-H2A.X) and DDR signaling intermediates, including phosphorylated checkpoint 1 (p-Chk1), phosphorylated checkpoint 2 (p-Chk2), and p53. Levels of the same DNA damage markers and DDR signaling intermediates were also determined in the mouse C17.2 neural stem cell line. Maternal diabetes and high glucose in vitro significantly increased the levels of p-H2A.X. Levels of p-Chk1, p-Chk2, and p53, were elevated under both maternal diabetic and high glucose conditions. SOD1 overexpression blocked maternal diabetes-induced DNA damage and DDR in vivo. Tempol, a SOD1 mimetic, diminished high glucose-induced DNA damage and DDR in vitro. In conclusion, maternal diabetes and high glucose in vitro induce DNA damage and activates DDR through oxidative stress, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated embryopathy."

NT may play a role in appetite regulation and may have potential in obesity treatment. Glucose ingestion stimulates NT secretion in healthy young humans, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Here, we show that rats express NT in the gut and that glucose gavage stimulates secretion similarly to oral glucose in humans. Therefore, we conducted experiments on isolated perfused rat small intestine with a view to characterize the cellular pathways of secretion. Luminal glucose (20% wt/vol) stimulated secretion but vascular glucose (5, 10, or 15 mmol/L) was without effect. The underlying mechanisms depend on membrane depolarization and calcium influx, since the voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor nifedipine and the KATP channel opener diazoxide, which causes hyperpolarization, eliminated the response. Luminal inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) (by phloridzin) eliminated glucose-stimulated release as well as secretion stimulated by luminal methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (20% wt/vol), a metabolically inactive SGLT1 substrate, suggesting that glucose stimulates secretion by initial uptake by this transporter. However, secretion was also sensitive to GLUT2 inhibition (by phloretin) and blockage of oxidative phosphorylation (2-4-dinitrophenol). Direct KATP channel closure by sulfonylureas stimulated secretion. Therefore, glucose stimulates NT secretion by uptake through SGLT1 and GLUT2, both causing depolarization either as a consequence of sodium-coupled uptake (SGLT1) or by closure of KATP channels (GLUT2 and SGLT1) secondary to the ATP-generating metabolism of glucose."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Sleep-active neurons located in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) play a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for their activation at sleep onset remain poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that a rise in extracellular glucose concentration in the VLPO can promote sleep by increasing the activity of sleep-promoting VLPO neurons. We find that infusion of a glucose concentration into the VLPO of mice promotes SWS and increases the density of c-Fos-labeled neurons selectively in the VLPO. Moreover, we show in patch-clamp recordings from brain slices that VLPO neurons exhibiting properties of sleep-promoting neurons are selectively excited by glucose within physiological range. This glucose-induced excitation implies the catabolism of glucose, leading to a closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The extracellular glucose concentration monitors the gating of KATP channels of sleep-promoting neurons, highlighting that these neurons can adapt their excitability according to the extracellular energy status. Together, these results provide evidence that glucose may participate in the mechanisms of SWS promotion and/or consolidation. Although the brain circuitry underlying vigilance states is well described, the molecular mechanisms responsible for sleep onset remain largely unknown. Combining in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that glucose likely contributes to sleep onset facilitation by increasing the excitability of sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). We find here that these neurons integrate energetic signals such as ambient glucose directly to regulate vigilance states accordingly. Glucose-induced excitation of sleep-promoting VLPO neurons should therefore be involved in the drowsiness that one feels after a high-sugar meal. This novel mechanism regulating the activity of VLPO neurons reinforces the fundamental and intimate link between sleep and metabolism."

The effect of hyperglycemia on thermoregulatory defenses remains unknown. We determined the effect of blood glucose concentration on the shivering threshold in rabbits. Twenty-seven rabbits lightly anesthetized with isoflurane were randomly assigned to infusions of (1) saline, (2) insulin titrated to produce blood glucose concentrations 60 to 100 mg/dL, or (3) 50% dextrose titrated to produce blood glucose concentrations 200 to 300 mg/dL. Core temperature was reduced at a rate of 2 to 3 \u00b0C/h by perfusing water at 10 \u00b0C through a plastic tube positioned in the colon. Cooling continued until shivering was observed by an investigator blinded to treatment or until esophageal (core) temperature reached 34 \u00b0C. Core temperatures at the onset of shivering defined the threshold. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Rabbits given saline shivered at 37.2 +/- 0.5 \u00b0C (mean +/- SD). Rabbits given insulin shivered at 36.3 +/- 1.1 \u00b0C. Rabbits given dextrose shivered at 38.0 +/- 0.6 \u00b0C. The shivering threshold increased as a function of blood glucose concentration: shivering threshold (deg C) = 0.009 [blood glucoseconcentration (mg/dL)] + 35.6, r = 0.53. The shivering threshold thus increased approximately 1 \u00b0C for each 100 mg/dL increase in blood glucoseconcentration. Hyperglycemia increases the threshold for shivering, whereas hypoglycemia lowers the threshold on rabbits."
