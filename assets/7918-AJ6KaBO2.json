Clinical observations of eye and respiratory tract irritation and reduced body weights were observed primarily at 20 ppm. Microscopic examination of tissue revealed signs of irritation of minimal severity in the respiratory tract (nasal passages; larynx) in most animals at the 5 ppm level. At 20 ppm, all animals showed minimal to moderate respiratory tract irritation (nasal passages; larynx; trachea; lungs). Systemic effects were not observed at 5 or 20 ppm. No effects were detected at 1 ppm. In animals exposed to the same level of acetic anhydride for 13 weeks and then allowed a 13 week period without exposure, significant recovery from irritation effects were reported."

At 100 ppm, severe respiratory tract irritation and body weight reduction were observed in the maternal animals. No developmental effects were seen at 25 ppm even though substantial irritation of the respiratory tract was observed in maternal animals. The NOEL for developmental/reproductive effects was considered to be 25 ppm."

Acetic anhydride was negative in these tests and the highest ineffective dose tested in any S. typhimurium strain was 1.0 mg/plate. This dose exhibited some clearing of the background bacterial lawn."
