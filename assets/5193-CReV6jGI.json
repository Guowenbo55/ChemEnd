It has a role as an anaesthesia adjuvant, a GABA modulator and a sedative. It is functionally related to a barbituric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a secobarbital (1-).",

Hepatic function is not adversely affected by barbiturates, but the drugs, particularly phenobarbital, induce hepatic microsomal enzymes and thus may alter the metabolism of other drugs.

            "Value": "Barbiturates are known to suppress protective immunity, and their therapeutic use is associated with nosocomial infections. Although barbiturates inhibit T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine synthesis, only thiobarbiturates markedly reduce the activation of immune regulatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB and nuclear factor of activated T cells. In this study, /the authors/ investigated barbiturate-mediated effects on the regulation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) in primary T lymphocytes. /Investigators/ show that both thiobarbiturates and their oxy-analogs inhibit AP-1-dependent gene expression and AP-1 complex formation at clinically relevant doses. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, which transcriptionally and posttranslationally regulates AP-1 complex formation, is suppressed by most barbiturates. CD3/CD28- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-induced p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation or c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 kinase activity was significantly diminished by pentobarbital, thiamylal, secobarbital, or methohexital treatment. These barbiturates also inhibited the initiators of the MAP kinase cascade, the small G proteins ras and rac-1, and prevented binding to their partners raf-1 and PAK, respectively. Thiopental, unlike the other barbiturates, only reduced ras and JNK activity upon direct CD3/CD28 receptor engagement. Contrarily, upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation, thiopental blocked AP-1-dependent gene expression independently of the small G protein ras and MAP kinases, thus suggesting an additional, unknown mechanism of AP-1 regulation. In conclusion, /these/ results contribute to the explanation of a clinically manifested immune suppression in barbiturate-treated patients and support the idea of a MAP kinase-independent regulation of AP-1 by PKC and calcium in human T cells."

            "Value": "Screening drugs used in obstetrical practice for effects on steroid hormone synthesis revealed that phenobarbital inhibited progesterone synthesis in MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The inhibition was apparently a drug class effect since it could be reproduced by other barbiturates. Barbiturate blockade was reversible and could be bypassed in the MA-10 cells by using 22-hydroxycholesterol. Human granulosa cell progesterone synthesis was also inhibited in a dose dependent fashion by phenobarbital, secobarbital and barbituric acid. Significant inhibition occurred in dose ranges that would be therapeutic for treating epilepsy. From these data we conclude that barbiturates block steroidogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol transport to the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme."

            "Value": "/Investigators/ examined the effects of secobarbital and other sedative-hypnotic barbiturates on the neuronal death induced by exposure to excitatory amino acids or deprivation of oxygen or glucose in mouse cortical cell cultures. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate, and kainate toxicities were attenuated in a concentration-dependent fashion by high concentrations of secobarbital or thiopental. Antagonism of NMDA toxicity was not overcome by increasing NMDA concentration and not mimicked by gamma-aminobutyrate. Despite these antiexcitotoxic actions, secobarbital exacerbated the neuronal death induced by deprivation of either glucose alone or oxygen and glucose together; death induced by oxygen deprivation alone was little affected. Thiopental and methohexital also increased oxygen-glucose deprivation injury. A possible explanation for this injury potentiation was provided by the observation that secobarbital enhanced the cellular ATP depletion induced by combined oxygen-glucose deprivation. Deleterious effects on ATP production may counterbalance the protective effects of barbiturates under some conditions."

            "Value": "Administration of the allylbarbiturate secobarbital (SB) to phenobarbital-pretreated rats is known to result in structural and functional loss of hepatic cytochrome P-450 and generation of N-alkylated prosthetic heme derivatives. Isozyme-selective functional markers have led us to confirm P-450b as the isozyme selectively inactivated by the drug. In contrast to its inactivation by allylisopropylacetamide, such SB-inactivated P-450b is not amenable to structural and functional repair by exogenous heme, for reasons that remain unclear. In an effort to gain some insight, /investigators/ have explored various possible mechanisms. In the course of these studies with rat liver microsomes enriched in P-450b as well as isolated purified P-450b, we have found that, along with prosthetic heme alkylation, a significant fraction of the hemoprotein also undergoes drug-mediated alkylation of the apocytochrome, presumably at the active site. Accordingly, an equimolar ratio of irreversibly bound drug to functionally inactive residual P-450b chromophore is observed after incubation of the purified isozyme with SB and NADPH. Thus, P-450b-mediated oxidative metabolism of SB appears to partition not only between prosthetic heme alkylation and epoxidation but apoprotein alkylation as well"
