    "Description": "Acetazolamide is a sulfonamide, a member of thiadiazoles and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It has a role as a diuretic, an anticonvulsant and an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor. It is a conjugate acid of an acetazolamide(1-). It derives from a hydride of a 1,3,4-thiadiazole.",

            "Value": "Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors potently inhibit (IC50 for acetazolamide is 10 nM) both the membrane bound and cytoplasmic forms of carbonic anhydrase, resulting in nearly complete abolition of NaHCO3 reabsorption in the proximal tubule. /Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/"

            "Value": "Although the proximal tubule is the major site of action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase also is involved in secretion of titratable acid in the collecting duct system (a process which involves a proton pump), and therefore the collecting duct system is a secondary site of action for this class of drugs. /Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/"

            "Value": "Acetazolamide frequently causes paresthesias and somnolence, suggesting an action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the CNS. The efficacy of acetazolamide in epilepsy is in part due to the production of metabolic acidosis; however, direct actions of acetazolamide in the CNS also contribute to its anticonvulsant action."

            "Value": "By inhibiting proximal reabsorption, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors increase delivery of solutes to the macula densa.
