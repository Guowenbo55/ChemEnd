However, the actual amount of compound translocated into plant tissue from the initial seed treatment has not been well-documented. A two-year field study compared clothianidin concentrations in maize with and without neonicotinoid seed treatments, finding neonicotinoids present in root tissues up to 34 days post-planting. Clothianidin concentrations followed an exponential decay pattern, with a maximum of 1.34% of the initial seed treatment recovered from plant tissues, and 0.26% recovered from root tissue. These findings suggest that while neonicotinoid seed treatments may provide some protection from early-season secondary maize pests, the overall proportion of clothianidin translocated into plant tissues is low. This may explain reports of inconsistent efficacy and increasing detections of environmental neonicotinoids.",

Chrysanthemum plants absorbed these pesticides from soils to various degrees, with bioconcentration factors (BCF) positively correlated with the lipophilicity (log Kow) of pesticides. The highly lipophilic fludioxonil (log Kow = 4.12) had the greatest BCF (2.96 \u00b1 0.41 g/g), while the hydrophilic thiamethoxam (log Kow = 0.13) had the lowest (0.09 \u00b1 0.03 g/g).

Metalaxyl-M and cyantraniliprole, with medium lipophilicity (log Kow of 1.71 and 2.02, respectively), and hydrophilic thiamethoxam showed relatively strong translocation potentials with TF values in the range of 0.29\u20130.81, 0.36\u20132.74, and 0.30\u20131.03, respectively.",
