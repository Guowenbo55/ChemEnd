Caspase inhibitors (pan-caspase, caspase-3, -8 or -9 inhibitor) did not affect the growth inhibition of CPAEC by PG. However, pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD) significantly reduced apoptosis and the loss of DeltaPsi(m) in PG-treated CPAEC. PG reduced ROS level and increased GSH depleted cell numbers in CPAEC.

We studied SARs of representatives of 10 polyphenol structural types: (+)-catechin (1), (-)-epicatechin (2), (-)-epigallocatechin (3), (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (4), gallic acid (5), procyanidin B2 (6), procyanidin B3 (7), procyanidin B4 (8), procyanidin C1 (9), and procyanidin C2 (10). Amongst them, the polyphenols containing a pyrogallol moiety (3-5) showed the most potent cytotoxicic activity. These compounds evoked a typical DNA-laddering phenomenon in HEK293T, which indicated that the induction of apoptosis at least partly mediates their cytotoxic activity. Anti-oxidative capacity of compounds 3-5 were comparable to those of the trimers 9 and 10, which were not cytotoxic. Therefore, /it was suggested/ that pyrogallol moiety is important for fitting of polyphenols to their putative target molecule(s) in non-oxidative mechanism."

DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that treatment with PG generally did not induce the specific cell cycle phase arrest. Treatment with 50 uM PG induced apoptosis approximately 20%, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V-staining cells. Treatment with PG also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) in SNU-484 cells.

In the Salmonella mutagenicity assay using 648-5000 ug/plate of cosmetic samples, none of the samples reached a 2-fold increase in revertants relative to the controls. Both in the absence and in the presence of S9, the dose-response relation in strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, and TA1537 was not significant (p>0.01). In the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, 10 Swiss male mice were orally administered 2000 mg/kg of sample per body weight/day. The ratio between polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes as well as the presence of micronuclei in bone marrow cells were determined. Equal numbers of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were detected between the cells of each treated group and the negative control, using ANOVA and chi-square analyses. Thus, none of the products induced mutagenesis in either assay. Previous studies have shown pyrogallol is mutagenic in various test systems, including Salmonella. However studies have also shown that acidic conditions may repress the reactive-oxygen species (ROS) produced by pyrogallol, and ROS is considered the primary mechanism for the mutagenicity of pyrogallol. Consistent with this are our results, which show that acidic, commercially available pyrogallol-containing hair gels are neither mutagenic in Salmonella nor induce micronuclei in mouse bone marrow in vivo."
