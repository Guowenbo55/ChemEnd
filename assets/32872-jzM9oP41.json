            "content": "In this study, the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of [0-ethyl-1-14C] isofenphos were investigated in Japanese cypress seedlings (Endlicher Cupressus obtusa K. KOCH). The results showed that the recovery of radiocarbon varied depending on the application site, with maximum absorption observed 30, 10, and 4 days after application when applied to the stem top, stem base, and roots, respectively. The highest radiocarbon absorption in plant tissues was observed when applied to the roots. Translocation of radiocarbon differed significantly based on the application site. When applied to the stem top and stem base, most of the radiocarbon remained at the application site, with limited translocation to the roots. However, in the case of root application, both absorption and translocation were considerably higher compared to the other application methods. Analysis of radiocarbon fractionation showed that the major portion of radiocarbon was partitioned in the benzene layer, with minimal amounts in the aqueous layer and unextractable residues. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the main metabolite was isofenphos-oxon, while minor metabolites included 0-ethyl 0-2-isopropoxycarbonylphenyl phosphoramidothioate (aminoisofenphos) and two unknown substances. The study also found that the transformation of isofenphos to isofenphos-oxon occurred easily in the seedlings, and the persistence of isofenphos-oxon varied depending on the application site. Two metabolites, hydrogen N-isopropylphosphoramidothioate (desphenylisofenphos) and 0-ethyl hydrogen N-isopropylphosphoramidate (desphenylisofenphos-oxon), were identified in the aqueous layer.",
