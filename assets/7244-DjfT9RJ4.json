            "Value": "Endeavour prawns from Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, and Groote Elylandt, Australia, contained 2-bromophenol at concentrations of 9.6 to 53, 2.7, and 1.0 ug/kg, respectively(1). Ten different species of fish, collected in August 1992 from the eastern coast of Australia, contained 2-bromophenol at concentrations of <0.05 to 0.1 ng/g for the carcass and <0.05 to 5.2 ng/g for the whole gut (analysis of single fish from each species)(2). Ocean fish were separated by species into pelagic carnivores, benthic carnivores, diverse omnivores and restricted omnivores; concentrations in the flesh ranged from <0.01 to 0.1 ng/g, <0.01 to 5.2 ng/g, <0.01 to 0.4, and <0.01 to 0.1 ng/g, respectively, while concentrations in the gut ranged from <0.01 to 0.2 ng/g, <0.01 to 27 ng/g, <0.01 to 1.2 ng/g, and <0.01 to 0.7 ng/g, respectively(3). Thirty samples of 9 species of prawns, collected from the eastern coast of Australia from 1993 to 1996, contained 2-bromophenol at concentrations of <0.01 to 42 ng/g(4). 2-Bromophenol concentrations in cultivated prawns ranged from <0.01 to 0.02 ng/g in the head and <0.01 to 0.01 ng/g in the tail(4). 2-Bromophenol was detected in marine fish, mollusks, and crustaceans obtained from a seafood shop in Hong Kong. Seasonal concentrations in the flesh of rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus) and brown-spotted grouper (Epinepheus areolatus) ranged from 0 to 10.7 ng/g and 0 to 4.18 ng/g, respectively; in the gut, concentrations ranged from 0 to 30.8 ng/g and 0 to 17.5 ng/g, respectively. In the mullusks, including clams (Tapes philippinarum) and oysters (Ostrea rivularis), seasonal concentrations ranged from 0.170 to 17.2 ng/g and 1.85 to 6.10 ng/g, respectively. For crustaceans, seasonal concentrations in the cephalothorax and tail of the shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) ranged from 1.27 to 7.72 ng/g and 0.421 to 5.87 ng/g, respectively; in crab (Charybdis feriatus), concentrations ranged from 0.991 to 34.4 ng/g(5)."
