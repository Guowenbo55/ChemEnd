    "Description": "Flupyradifurone is a tertiary amino compound that is ammonia in which the nitrogens have been replaced by (6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl, 2,2-difluoroethyl, and 5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl groups, respectively. A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist, it is used as an insecticide to control sucking pests in a variety of crops. It has a role as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist and an insecticide. It is a butenolide, a monochloropyridine, an organofluorine insecticide, an enamine and a tertiary amino compound.",

To address this, mustard field trials and hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate the residues distribution, uptake, and translocation of these pesticides. Field results indicated that the residues of BFI, ADP, and FPO in mustard plants were in the range of 0.001-1.87 mg/kg within 0-21 days and dissipated rapidly (half-lives of 5.2-11.3 days). FPO residues were predominantly distributed in cell-soluble fractions (>66.5%) due to its high hydrophilicity, while the hydrophobic BFI and ADP were primarily stored in cell walls and organelles. Hydroponic data revealed weak foliar uptake rates for BFI, ADP, and FPO (bioconcentration factors <1), but strong root uptake rates (bioconcentration factors >1). The translocation of these pesticides within the plant was limited (translation factor <1). BFI and ADP were taken up by roots through the apoplast pathway, while FPO was taken up via the symplastic pathway. This study enhances our understanding of pesticide residue formation in plants and provides insights for the safe application and risk assessment of BFI, ADP, and FPO.",

Samples of leaves, stems, and roots (500 g) were collected from 12 points in the plots at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after application. For root application, seedlings were transferred into nutrient solution with BFI, ADP, and FPO at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L. For foliar application, leaves were immersed in a solution containing 0.1 mg/L of each pesticide."
