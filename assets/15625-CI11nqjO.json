            "Value": "SOIL: As part of the National Dioxin Study, EPA conducted a 2-year nationwide study to assess the extent of TCDD contamination(1). In general, TCDD was detected infrequently and at very low concentrations in background soil samples taken at sites (urban and rural areas) that did not have previously known sources of TCDD contamination (1 parts per trillion detection limit)(1). Only 17 of 221 urban sites and 1 of 138 rural sites had detectable levels of TCDD, with 11.2 parts per trillion being the highest concentration reported(1,2). TCDD was not detected (detection limit range 0.75-2.9 parts per trillion) in soil samples from Elk River, Minnesota, a semi-rural area located about 25 miles northwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul(3). TCDD was measured in industrialized areas of several states (IL, MI, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, and WV)(4). The data show that in these typical industrialized areas, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin soil concentrations are below 0.01 ppb (range, not detected-9.4 parts per trillion)(4). Soil cores collected from roadsides in Times Beach, MO in 1985 which had been sprayed with waste oils containing TCDD in the early 1970s contained levels of 0.8-196 ppb with the concentrations decreasing below 15 cm(5). Levels of 4.4 to 382 ng/g were detected in soil at five different sites in Missouri which had been contaminated by waste oil(6). As of Oct 1984, TCDD had been detected at levels of 1 ppb or greater at 40 of 251 sites in Missouri during analysis by USEPA(7). Levels of 0.01-52 ng/g were found in soils from inside the Dow Chemical manufacturing facility in Midland, MI where a variety of chlorophenolic compounds are manufactured(8). TCDD soil concentrations in the city of Midland (0.6-450 parts per trillion) were higher in areas nearer the Dow Chemical Company Midland Plant site (22-450 parts per trillion)(8). This gradient suggests that operations on the Midland Plant site are associated with the appearance of the trace levels of TCDD in the nearby environment(8). Soil samples collected in five areas of Michigan had mean TCDD concentrations in the 0-1 inch layer of 2.1, 1.0, 36.6, 2.5 and 0.9 pg/g in 203 Tittabawassee River flood plane, 164 near flood plane, 37 industrial plume, 168 other Midland and Saginaw area samples and 194 Jackson and Calhoun county samples, respectively(9)."
