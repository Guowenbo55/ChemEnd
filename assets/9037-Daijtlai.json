When pesticides were applied to plant roots at equal rates, Schradan caused significantly less mortality of aphids feeding on leaves than other materials even 48 hours post-treatment. This suggests Schradan may be taken up and transported more gradually throughout broccoli vascular tissues. The data also indicated the activity of most pesticides, including Schradan, increased at higher temperatures. However, the elevated temperature had a particularly pronounced impact in raising Schradan's aphid mortality compared to compounds such as mevinphos. Therefore, Schradan appears to exhibit characteristics like solubility and mobility within broccoli that result in its concentration and efficacy being more dependent on environmental thermal variations compared to some other studied systemic insecticides.",

The results showed that some schradan was absorbed, some evaporated, and the rest remained as a residue on the leaf surface, which could be removed by aqueous leaching. The absorbed material was defined as that present on or in the plant and not removable by aqueous leaching at the time of harvest. Evaporation losses from leaves were found to be much lower than theoretical expectations. The study suggested that some breakdown of schradan may occur within the cuticular layer of the leaves. Absorption was shown to proceed through the cuticle rather than through the stomata. Temperature and illumination were found to have significant effects on absorption, with young leaves generally being more absorptive than older leaves. However, comparisons of absorption rates between different plant species should be interpreted with caution due to differences in physiological development. The study also discussed the theoretical evaporational loss of schradan and its actual behavior on sprayed surfaces, suggesting that the lipoid solubility of schradan may play a role in its behavior on leaf surfaces.",

Due to the different concentrations of dimefox (222 g/litre) and schradan (20 g/litre) in the applied commercial formulation Terra-Sytam, the concentration of schradan in the analyzed samples was much lower than that of dimefox. This suggests that schradan uptake is slower but has greater persistence compared to dimefox. The results showed that both insecticides were rapidly translocated throughout the plant, reaching maximum concentrations one week after treatment at both the top and base of the plant. However, concentrations at the top were somewhat lower than at the base. The insecticide content started to decrease earlier at the top, and after one month, the concentration had dropped to half the amount found in the rest of the plant. After 50 days, concentrations were identical throughout the plant. Even in green hop cones, the amounts of dimefox and schradan were never higher than 0.1 parts per million, indicating a low concentration in the plant tissue.",
