After 24 hours in 1 mg/L of fluorodifen-r-14C, 25% of the absorbed radioactivity was translocated from the roots. Cucumber seedlings degraded fluorodifen-r-14C via a pathway similar to that reported for peanut seedlings but at a slower rate. The major degradation products were p-nitrophenol and an unidentified polar compound (Unknown I). The combination of more rapid absorption and translocation, along with slower degradation, in cucumber compared to peanut seedlings, may contribute to the susceptibility of cucumber to fluorodifen.",

Fluorodifen was applied to both roots and leaves of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), grain sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea L.). The herbicide was absorbed by the treated tissue, but limited translocation into other plant parts was detected by gas chromatography, autoradiography, and liquid scintillation spectrometry.
