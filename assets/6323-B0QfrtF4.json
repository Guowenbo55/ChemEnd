The oxidation of 14C-methyl bromide to 14CO2 was measured in field experiments with soils collected from two strawberry plots fumigated with mixtures of methyl bromide and chloropicrin. Degradation of methyl bromide by chemical and/or biological processes accounted for 20 to 50% of the loss of methyl bromide during fumigation. Oxidation was by direct bacterial attack of methyl bromide and not of methanol (a product of chemical hydrolysis). Repeated addition of methyl bromide to live soils resulted in higher rates of removal, suggesting that soil bacteria used methyl bromide as an electron donor for growth(2)."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ /Researchers/ used the inhalation of methyl bromide gas to produce a near-complete destruction of the rat olfactory epithelium and analyzed the reinnervation of the bulb during reconstitution of the epithelium. The degeneration of olfactory axons elicits a transient up-regulation of glial cell proliferation and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the olfactory nerve and olfactory nerve layer of the bulb. Anterograde transport after intranasal infusion of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase demonstrates that the first nascent axons reach the bulb within the first week after lesion. Subsequently, a massive wave of fibers arrives at the bulb between 1 and 2 weeks postlesion, and enters the glomeruli between 2 and 3 weeks postlesion. However, the olfactory projection does not stabilize until 8 weeks after lesion judging from the return in growth associated protein-43 expression to control levels. The extent of reinnervation after lesion is correlated with the completeness with which the epithelium reconstitutes itself. In rats that are lesioned while fed ad libitum, there is near-complete reconstitution of the neuronal population, and the projection onto the bulb fills the glomerular layer in its entirety. However, in rats that are lesioned while food restricted, a significant fraction of olfactory epithelium becomes respiratory during its reconstitution, and the population of reinnervating fibers is less. As a consequence, the posterior half of the bulb remains hypoinnervated overall and denervated at its caudal margin. ... Accordingly, we hypothesize that the persistence of a significant population of pre-existing neurons is needed to preserve receptotopy during reinnervation. In addition, the results suggest that in the face of massive turnover and a reduced afferent population, there is a tendency for reinnervating axons to fill available synaptic space."

Histopathologically, the impairments to the epidermal cells, fibroblasts and blood vessels were observed in the early phase.

Urine samples collected at 52 and 104 weeks were assayed for standard urine chemistry parameters. Selected rats were killed at 52 weeks and all surviving rats were killed at 104 weeks and necropsied. Blood samples collected at necropsy were assayed for standard hematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Male rats fed the fumigated diet containing 500 ppm bromine had slight significant decreases in body weight gain. No other treatment related changes were noted. Males and females in the 500 ppm bromine group revealed transient increases in food and water consumption. No treatment related ophthalmological changes were noted. No significant treatment related changes in hematological or blood and urine chemistry parameters were detected. Male rats fed the 500 ppm bromine fumigated diet had a significantly increased incidence of hair loss. Relative liver, kidney, and brain weights were increased in these animals. A variety of age related nonneoplastic lesions and spontaneous neoplasms was noted in all groups. Focal fatty changes in the adrenal cortex of female rats were the only lesions that indicated a dose related increase. The authors conclude that methyl-bromide fumigated diets containing up to 500 ppm bromine are not carcinogenic to Fischer-344-rats."

A 1-yr feeding study in beagle dogs was conducted as a safety study, in which the high-dose diet was intended to yield a methyl bromide dose of at least 100 times the calculated human dietary exposure. Diets were fumigated with MB /methyl bromide/ and fed to the dogs daily, except for weekends and holidays. MB consumption each feeding day was calculated as a time weighted average (TWA) that accounted for the rate of degassing from the fumigated diet and the rate of feed consumption during the feeding period. TWA compound consumption in the low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively, averaged 0.06 + or - 0.02, 0.13 +/- 0.03 and 0.28 + or - 0.08 mg/kg/day in males and 0.07 + or - 0.03, 0.12 + or - 0.03 and 0.27 + or - 0.09 mg/kg/day in females.

P2-IRES-tauLacZ mice were exposed to methyl bromide, which causes epithelial damage and kills 90% of the P2 neurons. With subsequent neuronal regeneration, P2 neurons recover within their usual territory to equal control numbers by 1 month but then decline sharply to roughly 40% of control by 3 months. At this time, the P2 projection onto the olfactory bulb is erroneous in several respects. Instead of converging onto 1 or 2 glomeruli per surface, small collections of P2 axons innervate multiple glomeruli at roughly the same position in the bulb as in controls. Within these glomeruli, the P2 axons are aggregated near the edge, whereas the remainder of the glomerulus contains olfactory marker protein (+), non-P2 axons, violating the one receptor-one glomerulus rule normally observed. The aggregates are denser than found in control P2-innervated glomeruli, suggesting that the P2 axons may not be synaptically connected. Based on published literature and other data, we hypothesize that P2 neurons lose out in an activity-based competition for synaptic territory within the glomeruli and are not maintained at control numbers due to a lack of trophic support from the bulb."

Creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and bromide ion concentrations were measured in eight regions of the brain. Methyl bromide gas inhibited CK activities in all regions of the brain, though the inhibition tended to be smallest in the cerebellum (hemisphere and vermis) and largest in the brainstem (hypothalamus, midbrain, and medulla oblongata). The dose of methyl bromide to inhibit CK activities was lower than that to damage the central nervous system histologically. No inhibition of ASAT or LDH activities was seen except for a slight inhibition of these in striatum. Inhibition of CK activities did not increase clearly on increasing dose (290 to 495 ppm) or on prolonging exposure period (4 to 8 wk). Although 50% recovery of CK activities and the half-life of bromide ion agreed well in the medulla oblongata, changes in CK activities and bromide ion concentrations did not correlate otherwise. Thus, inhibition of CK activities in brain appears to be a sensitive indicator of methyl bromide intoxication, and may be related to genesis of its neurotoxicity. The inhibition seems to be caused by methyl bromide itself rather than by bromide ion. When effects on enzyme activities in brain homogenate were examined in vitro by bubbling with methyl bromide gas, CK inhibition was seen within 15 s of exposure. Dithiothreitol suppressed the CK inhibition, whereas N-acetylcysteine did not."

Extracellular field recordings and intracellular microelectrode recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that the neurons stay viable for at least one hour after application of the mono-halomethane. However, a moderate, but consistent, irreversible decrease in synaptic excitability was observed. The intracellular recordings indicate that this may be attributed to a decrease in excitatory postsynaptic potentials. No effects were observed at 0.7 mM methyl bromide. Bromide, in a dose-dependent, partly reversible manner (during one hour), produced a similar decrease in excitability. Quantitatively, the action of bromide at 0.5 mM resembled the one seen with methyl bromide at the concentration of 1.4 mM. Since methyl bromide did not induce electrophysiologic changes consistent with evidence of neurotoxicity during one hour of observation it is concluded that it lacks immediate toxic effects on hippocampal rat neurons."

MB-induced changes in NE contents lasted for at least 24 hr after the cessation of exposure. cAMP was increased and cGMP was reduced by MB exposure.
