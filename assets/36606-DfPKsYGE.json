No recognizable transformation products in soil accumulated beyond 4% of the applied herbicide. After 15 months, approximately 25% of the applied isopropalin remained in the soil, and less than 10% was observed after 28 months. Only negligible amounts of radioactivity were detected in crops grown in soil treated with the herbicide. Isopropalin and its recognizable transformation products were not detected in any of the plant tissues examined. Fractionation techniques indicated that the radioactivity was randomly distributed throughout the plant tissue.",
