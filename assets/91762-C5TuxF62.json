    "Description": "Chlorimuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is urea in which one of the nitrogens has been substituted by a (2-carboxyphenyl)sulfonyl group, while the other has been substituted by a 4-chloro-6-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl group. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used (generally as the corresponding ethyl ester) as a herbicide. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a member of benzoic acids, a N-sulfonylurea, a member of pyrimidines, an organochlorine pesticide, an aromatic ether and a sulfamoylbenzoate.",

Absorption and translocation of 14C following application of 14C-chlorimuron and 14C-2,4-DB were not affected by the presence of the other unlabeled herbicide, except in Florida beggarweed and peanut where 2,4-DB affected distribution of 14C-chlorimuron in the treated leaf. In field studies, maximum efficacy was obtained with mixtures of chlorimuron plus 2,4-DB applied 7 or 9 wk after planting. Florida beggarweed control was greatest with chlorimuron or chlorimuron mixtures while the addition of 2,4-DB to chlorimuron improved morningglory and sicklepod control. At 9 and 11 wk after planting, addition of 2,4-DB to chlorimuron controlled Florida beggarweed better than chlorimuron alone. Peanut yields were increased by the addition of 2,4-DB at later applications.",

Treatments were applied to three pots of each species with a moving-belt sprayer delivering a spray volume of 168 L ha-1. A nonionic surfactant was added at 25% by volume to the spray solutions.",

Foliar fresh weights of the plants were determined 10 days after treatment and expressed as percent of the untreated control. Each herbicide solution was applied as a single 5-\u00b5l drop to the youngest fully expanded leaf of each plant. There were four single-plant replicates for each species."
