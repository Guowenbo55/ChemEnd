    "Description": "Dehydroacetic acid is a pyran-2,4-dione substituted at position 3 by an acetyl group and at position 6 by a methyl group. A fungicide and bactericide it is used primarily in processed fruit and vegetables. It has a role as a fungicide, an antibacterial agent and a plasticiser. It is a pyran-2,4-dione and a ketone.",
