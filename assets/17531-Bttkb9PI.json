With most of the organophosphorus agents ... virtually all the acute effects of moderate doses are attributable to this action. /Anticholinesterase agents/"

The predominant effect on the heart from the peripheral action of accumulated ACh is bradycardia, resulting in a fall in cardiac output. Higher doses usually cause a fall in blood pressure, often as a consequence of effects of anticholinesterase agents on the medullary vasomotor centers of the CNS. /Anticholinesterase agents/"
