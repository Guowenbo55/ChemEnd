    "Description": "Fluopimomide is a benzamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxybenzoic acid with the amino group of 1-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]methanamine. It is a benzamide fungicide, synthesized by Shandong Sino-Agri United Biotechnology Co., Ltd (China). Used for the control of cucumber and grape downy mildew, phytophthora capsici, litchi downy blight, potato late blight, rice sheath blight, and cotton rhizoctonia solani. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a monochloropyridine, a benzamide fungicide, an organofluorine compound, a member of benzamides and a monomethoxybenzene.",

The calculated EC50 (effective concentration for 50% inhibition) for LH-2010A was 6.70 \u00b5g/mL, while fluopicolide had an EC50 of 7.67 \u00b5g/mL. LH-2010A was found to be absorbed by the plants and translocated to other sites within the plant. The downward transportation observed for LH-2010A differed from that of fluopicolide. The absorption of LH-2010A by cucumber roots was inhibited by low temperature, respiratory inhibitors, sucrose, and amino acids, indicating that the absorption process is an active process.",
