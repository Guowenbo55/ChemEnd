BCFs ranging from 68 to 344 were observed in brook trout after 0.33 and 5.83 days exposure to parathion concentrations of 3,180 and 270 ug/l, respectively(2). In a terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem, there was no evidence for bioaccumulation in any of the organisms, including snails, algae, daphnia, mosquito larvae, and fish, at the end of the 38-day experiment, although the ecosystem organisms contained radiolabeled carbon indicating the presence of metabolism products(3). There is no evidence of bioaccumulated parathion in cattle, sheep, or rabbits(3). The average BCF in killifish after 24 to 72 hours exposure to the individual pesticide was 98; the average BCF was 88 in killifish after 24 to 72 hours exposure to a mixture of pesticides, including parathion(4).

            "Value": "Parathion biodegrades in acclimated natural waters within several weeks(1,2). 5 ppm of parathion completely degraded within 2 weeks in acclimated water from Holland Marsh, a vegetable growing area in Ontario, being almost quantitatively converted to aminoparathion; only 10% degradation occurred in 16 weeks when the water was sterilized(1). In the waters of the Little Miami River, OH, a small stream which receives domestic and industrial waste as well as farm runoff, 50% of parathion (10 ppb) degraded in 1 week and none could be detected after 4 weeks(2). Surface water of varying salinity (0 to 28 ppt), collected from the Mississippi Sound estuary system degraded parathion with a 45-day half-life at 30 \u00b0C which was independent of salinity(3). Both chemical and the biological action of marine plankton were responsible(4). When the water was filtered to remove the plankton, the half-life at 27 \u00b0C increased from 41 to 56 days(4). Parathion (1.4 to 28 ppm) degradation in soil with 3 different moisture contents increased with parathion concentration and moisture content(5). The percentage of parathion degraded after 11 days ranged from 96% at high concentration and moisture levels to 20% at low concentrations and moisture levels(5). Further degradation was very slow and the degradation was never complete(5). One reference claims that residues of parathion persisted for >16 yr but the level of application was extremely high(6). After 8 weeks of incubation in an organic and a mineral soil, <2 and 6%, respectively, of the 1 ppm parathion applied remained; in sterilized controls 80 and 95% remained(7). The half-life of parathion (10 ppm) in a sandy loam and organic soil was <1 and 1.5 weeks with only 5% remaining after 3 and 10 weeks, respectively(9). A lag period of approximately 2 weeks occurred when 0.1 and 1 ppm parathion was incubated in Willamette clay loam at moisture levels of 50% field capacity; half-lives were 16 and 26 weeks, respectively(11). Metabolic pathways involve both oxidative and reductive reactions(9). The primary oxidative pathway involves an initial hydrolysis to p-nitrophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid(9). A second oxidative pathway involves oxidation to paraoxon(9). Under low oxygen conditions reduction to aminoparathion occurs(9). When parathion (500 ppm) is incubated in flooded alluvial soil, 43% remained after 6 days and 0.09% after 12 days(12). The parathion is reduced to aminoparathion under these anaerobic conditions. Amendation of the soil with rice straw increases the rate of degradation(12). In parallel experiments in which parathion was incubated for 30 min in soil suspensions of 5, 30-day flooded (anaerobic) soils and aerobic soils, no degradation occurred in the aerobic soils, while 35 to 68% degradation occurred in the anaerobic soils. The most reduced soils effected the most rapid degradation(13). After repeated application of parathion to flooded soils the degradation pathway shifts from reduction to hydrolysis(14). Parathion is more persistent in flooded saline soils than non-saline soils; degradation was completed in 20 days in a non saline soil and the degradation rate decreased with salinity in 5 soils, ranging from 10 to 50% in 20 days(15). Parathion is degraded in activated sludge treatment plants. With adequate aeration, high levels of parathion wastes were destroyed within 7-10 days in a treatment plant(8). Parathion is destroyed during composting agricultural wastes(10)."

After 30 days incubation in non-sterile coastal river water, only 21, 14, and 6% of parathion remained at pH values of 6,7, and 8.16, respectively; in sterilized coastal river water, 64, 57, and 49% of the initial parathion remained after 30 days incubation at pH values of 6, 7, and 8.16, respectively(2)."

Covalent binding of (atomic) sulfur released in the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase catalyzed metabolism of certain thiono-sulfur compounds appears to be responsible for inhibition of monooxygenase activity & the loss of cytochrome p450 seen on admin of these compounds in vivo & incubation with cytochrome p450 monooxygenase enzymes in vitro. Liver necrosis & perhaps the induction of lung edema & neoplasia, as well as other effects of thiono-sulfur containing compounds are more likely the result of the covalent binding of electrophilic S-oxides or S-dioxides or carbene derivatives to tissue macromolecules. The rationale for implicating metabolites of thiono-sulfur compounds other than sulfur in these effects derives from the experiments with thioacetamide & the fact that atomic sulfur is highly reactive & appears to bind predominantly or exclusively to cytochrome p450."

Animals exposed in vivo had lowered ascorbate and hydroxyproline, malathion and malaoxon lowered lysyl oxidase in vitro."

            "Value": "We have evaluated the embryo lethality and embryo toxicity of parathion (diethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate) employing a rat post implantation embryo culture system. Sprague-Dawley rat embryos, explanted on day 11 of gestation, were cocultured with parathion for 24 hours in a defined cell culture medium consisting of 50% Waymouth's 752/1 medium and 50% fresh rat serum supplemented with antibiotics. At higher dose range (0.5-1 uL/mL), direct embryo lethality monitored as loss of yolk sac circulation and embryonic heart beat was observed. At lower dose levels (0.0625 and below), dose-dependent embryotoxic effects were observed including decreased growth, limb bud and somite development. Culture supplementation with hepatic S-9 fractions isolated from Aroclor 1254-pretreated rats significantly decreased parathion embryo toxicity. These findings suggest that parathion possesses direct embryo toxicity and that prenatal toxic effects associated with this compound can be altered by enzyme-mediated biotransformation."

            "Value": "The effects of ethyl parathion on the activities of various renal enzymes were studied in the offspring from dams treated with this insecticide during pregnancy. The enzymes tested were the (Na+-K+)- and the Mg2+-dependent ATPases, the glutathione S-transferases and carboxylesterases. The postnatal effects of parathion on kidney ATPases from undernourished rats were also assessed. The organophosphate was administered per os to pregnant rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight per day throughout gestation, and suspended after delivery. The offspring were divided in groups of normally-fed and undernourished rats. In the undernourished group, food restriction produced a decrease of 43% in body weight as compared to the normally-fed group. Offspring were sacrificed 6 weeks after birth and the enzymatic activities were determined in kidney homogenates. We found a decrease in the enzymatic activity of total ATPases, at the expense of the Mg2+-dependent ATPase. However, the activities of the (Na+-K+)-dependent ATPase, the glutathione S-transferases and the carboxylesterases did not show significant changes. On the other hand, under nutrition did not potentiate the effects of parathion on the ATPases. Thus, this organophosphate administered during pregnancy produced a selective inhibition on the renal Mg2+-dependent ATPase from offspring, which was not potentiated by our under nutritional model."

            "Value": "Bobwhite quail eggs were injected at 48 or 72 hr of incubation with various doses of the organophosphate (OP) insecticides diazinon or parathion and the embryos were examined after an additional 48 hr of incubation by both histological and cartilage-staining methods. Bobwhite embryos did not display the notochordal folding or vascular enlargement reported for organophosphate-injected chicken embryos. Cartilage staining of embryos injected with insecticide at 72 hr of incubation and recovered at day 12 of incubation revealed severe shortening and contortion of the vertebral axis, as well as tibiotarsal, rib, and sternum defects. Parathion was more potent in causing skeletal defects than diazinon. No type I defects (micromelia, parrot beak) were detected. Radiometric acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assays of whole embryo homogenates were performed for day 6, 9, and 12 diazinon-injected and control embryos. Diazinon effected drastic reductions in acetylcholinesterase activity. Although the acetylcholinesterase and axial skeletal responses of bobwhite embryos to organophosphate injection are similar to those reported in the literature for other species, some major differences in the bobwhite response were noted: namely, the absence of notochordal folding in the young bobwhite embryo and the absence of type I defects at day 12. These differences suggest that further studies with the bobwhite quail would be useful in clarifying the mechanisms involved in organophosphate-induced teratogenesis."

It was observed that the insecticides like ethyl parathion, phosphamidon, phosalone, endosulfan, carbofuran, monocrotophos, carbaryl and formothion were found to be significantly superior over control as ovicides. The order of toxicity observed to be was ethyl parathion, phosphamidon, phosalone, endosulfan carbofuran, monocrotophos, carbaryl and formothion which gave 69.43, 64.43, 55.95, 49.79, 46.71, 44.39, 42.81 and 36.51 per cent mortalities of eggs, respectively. The treatment with ethyl parathion was found to be the most effective against the eggs of spotted bollworm (Earias fabia Stoll) followed by the treatments with phosphamidon, phosalone and endosulfan. The latter three treatments were at par with each other. The insecticidal treatments like malathion, quinalphos, methyl demeton, endrin, phenthoate, DDT, BHC and dimethoate were observed to be ineffetive as ovicides as they were found to be at par with control."

            "Value": "Juvenile rats are more susceptible to the acute toxicity of the phosphorothionate insecticides parathion and chlorpyrifos than are adult rats. Developmental changes in brain acetylcholinesterase and hepatic aliesterase (carboxylesterase), cytochrome P450, and the P450-mediated metabolism of these two phosphorothionate insecticides were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Specific activities of acetylcholinesterase in cerebral cortex, but not medulla oblongata, and of liver aliesterases increased with age, indicating the presence of both more target esterases and more protective esterases, respectively, in the adult compared to the juvenile animal. Sensitivity of the brain acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by paraoxon and chlorpyrifosoxon, as measured by IC50 values, did not change significantly with age, whereas the hepatic aliesterase sensitivity to inhibition decreased with age. Progressive increases in activities of P450-mediated activation (desulfuration) (6- to 14-fold) and detoxication (dearylation) (2- to 4-fold), as well as concentrations of P450 (7-fold) and protein (2-fold), were observed between neonate and adult hepatic microsomes. Microsomal pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity followed a developmental pattern similar to desulfuration and dearylation, displaying a 16-fold increase between neonates and adults. However, microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity increased until 21 days of age, displaying a 16-fold increase, then decreased in adulthood to a level 10-fold higher than neonates. These results indicate that target enzyme sensitivity is not responsible for age-related toxicity differences, nor is the potential for hepatic bioactivation, whereas lower levels of hepatic aliesterase-mediated protection and P450-mediated dearylation probably contribute significantly to the greater sensitivity of juveniles to phosphorothionate toxicity."

The fraction of parathion leached from soil by 10 successive 200 ml applications of water to a soil column was 1.24 and 4.36 for an organic soil and sand, respectively(9). Only a small fraction of parathion adsorbed to a sandy loam, 10%, was found to undergo diffusion (diffusion constant in soil with highest moisture content 0.03 sq cm/day)(10). In soil columns of Nacodoches clay subsoil, parathion leached to 60 inches when 230 inches of rainfall was simulated, while in Houston black clay, 1725 inches of rain were required to produce leaching to 60 inches(13). In field studies, little leaching occurred in 16 yr after 4 annual applications of parathion despite 42 inches of precipitation per year(13). Little parathion was found below 9 inches, 6 yr after 30,000 to 95,000 ppm was applied to the soil(14). In a 15-yr study of residues in a light sand soil, no parathion was found below 8 inches(13). In an 8 mo persistence test under experimental conditions with 20 cm of simulated rain, no parathion was found below 1 inch. In cases where small amounts of parathion penetrated into the soil, it was believed to be the result of the movement of particulate or microparticulate matter containing sorbed parathion(13). In a field study involving the application of parathion to a peach orchard providing watershed for a 2.7 acre pond, no residue was found below 6 inches and there appeared to be little desorption of the insecticide from the bottom sediment of the pond(15). According to a classification scheme(16), these Koc values suggest that parathion is expected to have moderate to no mobility in soil."
