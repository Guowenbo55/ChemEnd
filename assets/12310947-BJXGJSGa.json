    "Description": "Aldrin is an organochlorine compound resulting from the Diels-Alder reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with norbornadiene. A proinsecticide (by epoxidation of the non-chlorinated double bond to give dieldrin), it was widely used as an insecticide before being banned in the 1970s as a persistent organic pollutant. It has a role as a persistent organic pollutant and a proinsecticide. It is an organochlorine insecticide and an organochlorine compound.",

The results demonstrate that insecticide uptake in the plant varies with the time of treatment application and with the rate of plant development. The accumulation of heptachlor in the plant is low compared to aldrin and dieldrin, and conversely, the translocation is higher for heptachlor, lower for aldrin, and poor for dieldrin. In the corn kernels, up to 70% heptachlor, 31% aldrin, and 4% dieldrin are accumulated. In the plant, aldrin is metabolized into dieldrin and heptachlor into heptachlor-epoxide.",
