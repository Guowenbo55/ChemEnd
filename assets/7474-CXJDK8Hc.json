            "Value": "PURE CULTURE: 61-70% reduction of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene after 8 - 13 days was observed when a mixture of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene under continuous flow conditions involving feeding, aeration, settling and reflux was inoculated with a species of Arthrobacter simplex isolated from industrial waste. When two aeration columns were used, one with A. simplex and the other with A. simplex, Streptomyces coelicolor, Fusarium sp. and Trichoderma viridis isolated from soil, a 90% reduction of the nitro compounds was observed after 10 days. The reduction of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene produced p-chloroaniline and some undefined products(1). The yeast Rhodosporidiam sp. reduced 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene under aerobic conditions to give 4-chloroacetanilide and 4-chloro-2-hydroxyacetanilide as final major metabolites(2). Whether these reductions in pure culture would occur in waste water treatment plants is unknown(SRC)."
