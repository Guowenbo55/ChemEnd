            "Value": "Macrolide antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents that inhibit protein synthesis by binding reversibly to 50S ribosomal subunits of sensitive microorganisms, at or very near the site that binds chloramphenicol. Erythromycin does not inhibit peptide bond formation per se, but rather inhibits the translocation step wherein a newly synthesized peptidyl tRNA molecule moves from the acceptor site on the ribosome to the peptidyl donor site. Gram-positive bacteria accumulate about 100 times more erythromycin than do gram-negative bacteria. Cells are considerably more permeable to the un-ionized form of the drug, which probably explains the increased antimicrobial activity at alkaline pH."

            "Value": "Although stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) via its cognate receptor CXCR4 is assumed to play a critical role in migration of endothelial cells during new vessel formation after tissue injury, CXCR4 expression on endothelial cells is strictly regulated. Erythromycin (EM), a 14-membered ring macrolide, has an anti-inflammatory effect that may account for its clinical benefit in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the effects of EM on endothelial cells and especially their expression of CXCR4 have not been fully evaluated. In this study, we demonstrated that EM markedly induced CXCR4 surface expression on microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and lung capillary endothelial cells in vivo. This ability to induce CXCR4 surface expression on endothelial cells was restricted to 14-membered ring macrolides and was not observed in other antibiotics including a 16-membered ring macrolide, josamycin. Furthermore, this EM-induced expression of CXCR4 on endothelial cells was functionally significant as demonstrated by chemotaxis assays in vitro. These findings suggest that EM-induced CXCR4 surface expression on endothelial cells may promote migration of CXCR4-expressing endothelial cells into sites of tissue injury, which may be associated with the known anti-inflammatory activity of this macrolide."
