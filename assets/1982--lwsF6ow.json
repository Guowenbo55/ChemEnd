    "Description": "Acephate is a phosphoramide that is methamidophos in which one of the hydrogens is replaced by an acetyl group. It has a role as an acaricide, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor and an agrochemical. It is a mixed diacylamine, a phosphoramide, an organic thiophosphate and an organothiophosphate insecticide. It is functionally related to a member of methamidophos.",

The main approach for control has been chemical intervention, but the study aimed to explore effective pest control methods while considering the environmental impact of pesticide use. The research evaluated the efficacy of acephate, applied through foliar spraying and root irrigation, in controlling S. frugiperda infestation in maize plants. It also examined the absorption, distribution, and dissipation of acephate and methamidophos in maize. Field trials revealed that root irrigation with acephate at a dosage of 6000 g a.i. ha\u22121 was the most effective method for S. frugiperda control. The study found that acephate and methamidophos were absorbed by maize roots, transported upwards, and concentrated in the leaves, particularly the new leaves. However, the residues of acephate and methamidophos in maize grains were undetectable after 60 days of treatment. The results indicated that root irrigation with acephate offered superior control over foliar spraying, with more uniform translocation and distribution of the pesticides and an extended period of efficacy. This method provides a potential approach to reduce pesticide residues while effectively managing S. frugiperda infestation in maize crops.",
