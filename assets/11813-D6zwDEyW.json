Neither 2,6-DNT nor 2,4-dinitrotoluene is carcinogenic in the strain A mouse lung bioassay. The ip administration of 2,6-DNT or 2,4-dinitrotoluene (150 mg/kg each) to Fischer 344 rats resulted, after 24 hr, in covalent binding to DNA of the liver (131.1 to 259.9 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 215.4 to 226.8 pmol 2,4-dinitrotoluene/mg DNA), and lower binding to DNA of the lung and the intestine (14.9 to 22.7 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 45.0 to 75.0 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA). Similar treatment of A/J mice resulted in lower binding in the liver (25.9 to 31.9 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 42.6 to 58.9 pmol 2,4-dinitrotoluene/mg DNA), no detectable binding of 2,6-DNT in extrahepatic tissues and low amounts of binding of 2,4-dinitrotoluene to lung and intestinal DNA (9.7 to 39.0 pmol/mg DNA). Covalent binding of the noncarcinogenic isomeric 2,4-dinitrotoluene to DNA of various tissues of both species suggests that factors other than binding to DNA determine the ultimate carcinogenic effect of these cmpd."

            "Value": "... Sprague-Dawley female rats were exposed via gavage to one of five concentrations of one of five nitrotoluenes [2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT) 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoulene (4ADNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4DNT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6DNT)] with necropsy and tissue collection at 24 or 48 hr. Gene expression profile results correlated well with clinical data and liver histopathology that lead to the concept that hematotoxicity was followed by hepatotoxicity. Overall, 2,4DNT, 2,6DNT and TNT had stronger effects than 2ADNT and 4ADNT. Common functional terms, gene expression patterns, pathways and networks were regulated across all nitrotoluenes. These pathways included NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. One biological process common to all compounds, lipid metabolism, was found to be impacted both at the transcriptional and lipid production level. ..."
