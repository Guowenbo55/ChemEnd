    "Description": "Iminoctadine is a member of the class of guanidines that is dioctylamine in which a hydrogen from each of the terminal methyl groups is replaced by a guanidino group. Once used as a fungicidal seed dressing, it is no longer approved for use in the European Union. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of guanidines, a secondary amino compound and an aliphatic nitrogen antifungal agent.",

Inu-apple) were studied over 12 weeks under laboratory conditions using 14C-labeled guazatine-TA. Autoradiographic studies showed that there was no observable movement of radiocarbon in the apple leaves following foliar application of 14C-guazatine-TA to either the abaxial or adaxial surface of the leaves. The rate of penetration of 14C into the apple fruits was extremely slow, with a major part of the 14C retained on the surface after application. Quantitative determination of 14C in the treated leaves indicated that the rate of 14C disappearance from the leaves was very slow, with approximately 87% of the applied 14C still located in the treated leaves after 12 weeks. The radiocarbon poorly penetrated the leaf tissues, with only 21% of the applied 14C found in the leaf tissues after 12 weeks. Similar results were observed in the fruits. The radioactive compounds dislodged from the surface of both leaves and fruits consisted mainly of intact guazatine. Phototransformation products, including a major product (Pm) and a few minor ones, were also detected, indicating photolysis of 14C-guazatine on the surfaces. Extracts from both leaves and fruits contained intact guazatine as the primary radioactive component, along with photolysis products, suggesting that guazatine and its photoproducts were highly resistant to plant metabolism. Translocation of radiocarbon from the 14C-guazatine-TA treated leaves to symplasts (fruits and newly developed leaves after treatment) was negligible, indicating limited movement of the compound within the plant.",
