    "Description": "Spirotetramat is an azaspiro compound that is methoxycyclohexane which is fused at position 4 to the 5-position of a 1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one that is substituted at positions 3 and 4 by 2,5-dimethylphenyl and (ethoxycarbonyl)oxy groups, respectively (the cis isomer). It is a proinsecticide (via hydrolysis of the ethyl carbonate group to give the corresponding 4-hydroxypyrrol-2-one, \"spirotetramat-enol\") and is used for the control of a wide range of sucking insects on fruit and potato crops. It has a role as a proinsecticide, an EC 6.4.1.2 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) inhibitor and an agrochemical. It is a member of benzenes, an azaspiro compound, a carbonate ester, a gamma-lactam and a member of pyrroles.",

Results showed that pymetrozine promoted the uptake of spirotetramat from the nutrition solution after root application. The root concentration factor was 0.290 and 1.566 after spirotetramat single application and mixed-application with pymetrozine, respectively. It had little effect on the degradation of spirotetramat, with the metabolites of M-keto, M-enol, and M-glu in tomato issue (root, stems, and leaves). After foliar treatments, pymetrozine accelerated the translocation of spirotetramat from leaves to stems, with the translocation factor of 0.145 and 0.402 after spirotetramat single application and mixtures with pymetrozine, respectively. Pymetrozine also promoted the degradation of spirotetramat to M-kto and M-enol in leaves. Besides, a partition-limited model was used to describe the distribution processes of spirotetramat in the tomato-water system after root application. It showed that pymetrozine accelerated the distribution balance of spirotetramat in the whole system. Our result indicates that the interaction among pesticides should be considered when studied for the uptake, translocation, and degradation of pesticides in crops.",

However, information about the transfer and cell diffusion characteristics of pesticides in vegetables is insufficient. In this study, we investigated the uptake, translocation, and subcellular distribution behaviors of four commonly used pesticides in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) under laboratory hydroponic conditions. Root uptake of pesticides followed the order of fenbuconazole > avermectin > thiamethoxam > spirotetramat. Thiamethoxam was more readily translocated from the root to the shoot, while spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin preferentially accumulated in the root. Cell soluble components were the dominant storage compartment for thiamethoxam, while the majority of spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin were partitioned into the cell walls.

These negative effects were minimised when an organosilicone/organic fluid blend adjuvant (Du-Wett\u00ae) was included in the tank mix.

Pymetrozine exhibited higher translocation from roots to shoots compared to spirotetramat. Pymetrozine was primarily absorbed in roots via the symplastic pathway and stored in the soluble fraction of lettuce root and shoot cells. Spirotetramat and its metabolites showed major enrichments in the cell wall and soluble fractions of root cells. In lettuce shoot cells, spirotetramat and B-enol were mainly enriched in the soluble fraction, while B-keto and B-glu accumulated in cell walls and organelles, respectively. Both symplastic and apoplastic pathways were involved in spirotetramat absorption. The uptake of pymetrozine and spirotetramat by lettuce roots was passive, with no aquaporin-mediated dissimilation or diffusion. These findings improve our understanding of the transfer of these pesticides and their metabolites from the environment to lettuce, as well as their subsequent bioaccumulation.
