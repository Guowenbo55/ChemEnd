            "Value": "... The metabolic mechanisms of methanol toxicity /are/ reviewed. ... It is noted that the most severe toxicity occurs many hours following peak blood and tissue methanol concentrations so that these do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of toxicity. Individual differences are seen both in this latent period and in individual susceptibility to methanol. This susceptibility may depend on the activity of folic acid requiring metabolic reactions involved in formate metabolism, formate being an intermediate produced during methanol oxidation and responsible for many toxic effects of methanol. Studies of the characteristics of methanol poisoning in non-primates and monkeys are examined. Despite the ingestion of lethal doses of methanol, non-primates generally do not develop significant metabolic acidosis nor impairment of vision, and no consistent histopathology has been demonstrated in these species. In monkeys, results suggest that the latent period represents a period of compensated metabolic acidosis; when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, blood pH begins to drop. Formate accumulates and produces acidosis in the methanol poisoned monkey, but not in the rat, apparently due to a slower rate of formate metabolism to carbon dioxide in the monkey. ... Studies demonstrating the role of alcohol dehydrogenase in methanol metabolism in the monkey are reported; however, the catalase/peroxidative system which participates in methanol metabolism in rats apparently does not function in the monkey. Formaldehyde and formate metabolism are also examined. The regulation of the rate of formate metabolism is governed by regulation of the hepatic tetrahydrofolate concentrations. ... Further research is needed to determine what step or process it is which places the primate at a distinct liability in the metabolic disposition of one carbon moieties."

            "Value": "Methanol toxicity is observed in monkeys and humans but is not seen in rats or mice. The expression of methanol poisoning is related to the ability of an animal to metabolize formate to carbon dioxide. Since the rate of formate oxidation is related to hepatic tetrahydrofolate content and the activites of folate dependent enzymes, studies were designed to determine hepatic concentrations of hepatic tetrahydrofolate and activites of folate dependent enzymes of human liver and livers of species considered insensitive to methanol poisoning. An excellent correlation between hepatic tetrahydrofolate and maximal rates of formate oxidation has been observed. In human liver, levels were only 50% of those observed for rat liver and similar to those found in monkey liver. Total folate was also lower (60% decreased) in human liver than that found in rat or monkey liver. Interestingly, mouse liver contains much higher hepatic tetrahydrofolate and total folate than rat or monkey liver. This is consistent with higher formate oxidation rates in this species. A second important observation has been made. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of formate oxidation to carbon dioxide, was markedly reduced in both monkey and human liver. Thus, two mechanisms may be operative in explaining low formate oxidation in species susceptible to methanol toxicity, low hepatic tetahydrofolate levels and reduced hepatic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity."

            "Value": "Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, has been hypothesized to produce retinal and optic nerve toxicity by disrupting mitochondrial energy production. It has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidase, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in ATP synthesis. Inhibition occurs subsequent to the binding of formic acid to the ferric heme iron of cytochrome oxidase, and the apparent inhibition constant is between 5 and 30 mM. Concentrations of formate present in the blood and tissues of methanol-intoxicated humans, non-human primates and rodent models of methanol-intoxication are within this range. Studies conducted in methanol-sensitive rodent models have revealed abnormalities in retinal and optic nerve function and morphology, consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin. In these animal models, formate oxidation is selectively inhibited by dietary or chemical depletion of folate coenzymes, thus allowing formate to accumulate to toxic concentrations following methanol administration. Methanol-intoxicated rats developed formic acidemia, metabolic acidosis and visual toxicity analogous to the human methanol poisoning syndrome."

            "Value": "In addition to neurofunctional changes, bioenergetic and morphological alterations indicative of formate-induced disruption of retinal energy metabolism have been documented in methanol-intoxicated rats. Morphological studies, coupled with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, revealed generalized retinal edema, photoreceptor and /retinal pigment epithelium/ (RPE) vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling and a reduction in cytochrome oxidase activity in photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol intoxicated rats. The most striking structural alterations observed in the retinas of methanol-intoxicated rats were vacuolation and mitochondrial swelling in inner segments of the photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol-intoxicated rats were swollen and expanded to disrupted cristae and showed no evidence of cytochrome oxidase reaction product. In contrast, photoreceptor mitochondria from control animals showed normal morphology with well-defined cristae and were moderately reactive for cytochrome oxidase reaction product. These findings are consistent with disruption of ionic homoeostasis in the photoreceptors, secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial function. Biochemical measurements also showed a significant reduction in retinal and brain cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats relative to control animals. Surprisingly, no differences from control values were observed in hepatic, renal or cardiac cytochrome oxidase activity or ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats. The reduction in retinal function, inhibition of retinal, optic nerve and brain cytochrome oxidase activity, depletion of retinal and brain ATP concentrations, and mitochondrial disruption produced in methanol-intoxicated rats are consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin with selectivity for the retina and brain."

Thus, humans ... possess low hepatic H4 folate levels, low rates of formate oxidation and accumulation of formate after methanol.

It is metabolized in the liver, and its metabolite formic acid has direct toxic effects, causing oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and increased lipid peroxidation associated with the mechanism of neurotoxicity. Methanol is known to cause acute toxicity of the central nervous system; however, the effects on peripheral neuromuscular transmission are unknown. In our study, we aimed to investigate the electrophysiological effects of experimentally induced acute methanol intoxication on neuromuscular transmission in the early period (first 24 hr).  After approval by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Ege University, the study was carried out on 10 Wistar rats, each weighing about 200 g.

Methanol's well known toxicity and use in a wide spectrum of applications has raised long-standing environmental issues over its safety, including its carcinogenicity. Methanol has not been listed as a carcinogen by any regulatory agency; however, there are debates about its carcinogenic potential. Formaldehyde, a metabolite of methanol, has been proposed to be responsible for the carcinogenesis of methanol. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and actively targets DNA and protein, causing diverse DNA and protein damage. However, formaldehyde-induced DNA adducts arising from the metabolism of methanol have not been reported previously, largely due to the absence of suitable DNA biomarkers and the inability to differentiate what was due to methanol compared with the substantial background of endogenous formaldehyde. Recently, we developed a unique approach combining highly sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods and exposure to stable isotope labeled chemicals to simultaneously quantify formaldehyde-specific endogenous and exogenous DNA adducts. In this study, rats were exposed daily to 500 or 2000 mg/kg [13CD4]-methanol by gavage for 5 days. Our data demonstrate that labeled formaldehyde arising from [13CD4]-methanol induced hydroxymethyl DNA adducts in multiple tissues in a dose-dependent manner. The results also demonstrated that the number of exogenous DNA adducts was lower than the number of endogenous hydroxymethyl DNA adducts in all tissues of rats administered 500 mg/kg per day for 5 days, a lethal dose to humans, even after incorporating an average factor of 4 for reduced metabolism due to isotope effects of deuterium labeled methanol into account."

Blood alcohol levels (mM) for the two alcohols obtained in control animals were equivalent following the final dose. Both alcohols produced a dose dependent reduction in baseline startle amplitude that was greater during exposure to ethanol than methanol. Loudness functions associated with pulse intensity were not diminished by the alcohols, however inhibition produced by a gap in noise was reduced following the highest dose of either alcohol."

Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brains found increased neuronal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus and an increased cellular apoptotic marker in hippocampal CA1 neurons (approx. 10% of neurons displayed chromatin condensation) in the methanol-fed groups. Two additional in vitro experiments in mouse embryonic cerebral cortex neurons and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells found that formaldehyde, but not methanol or the methanol end product formic acid, induced microtubule disintegration and tau protein hyperphosphorylation.

This paper expands this investigation to the non-human primate, rhesus macaque, through the chronic feeding of young male monkeys with 3% methanol ad libitum. Variable Spatial Delay Response Tasks of the monkeys found that the methanol feeding led to persistent memory decline in the monkeys that lasted 6 months beyond the feeding regimen. This change coincided with increases in tau protein phosphorylation at residues T181 and S396 in cerebrospinal fluid during feeding as well as with increases in tau phosphorylated aggregates and amyloid plaques in four brain regions postmortem: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and the hippocampus. Tau phosphorylation in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be dependent on methanol feeding status, but phosphorylation changes in the brain were found to be persistent 6 months after the methanol feeding stopped. This suggested the methanol feeding caused long-lasting and persistent pathological changes that were related to AD development in the monkey. Most notably, the presence of amyloid plaque formations in the monkeys highlighted a marked difference in animal systems used in AD investigations, suggesting that the innate defenses in mice against methanol toxicity may have limited previous investigations into AD pathology. Nonetheless, these findings support a growing body of evidence that links methanol and its metabolite formaldehyde to AD pathology."

The concern stems from a few animal studies reporting an association, although evidence suggests the studies may have been confounded by chronic respiratory infection.

In this article, we apply our Hypothesis-Based Weight-of-Evidence (HBWoE) approach to evaluate the evidence regarding methanol exposure and lymphoma, attending to how human, animal, and mode-of-action results inform one another, tracing the logic of inference within and across all studies, and articulating how one could account for the suite of available observations. Upon comparison of alternative proposals regarding what causal processes may have led to the array of observations as we see them, we conclude that the apparent association between methanol exposure and lymphoma in some animal studies is weak and strains biological plausibility, and is better interpreted as due to confounding or to a mechanism not relevant in humans."

Radiofrequency (RF) radiation is used in numerous workplaces, and many workers are concurrently exposed to RF radiation and various chemicals. The developmental toxicity of RF radiation is associated with the degree and duration of hyperthermia induced by the exposure. Previous animal research indicates that hyperthermia induced by an elevation in ambient temperature can potentiate the toxicity and teratogenicity of some chemical agents. We previously demonstrated that combined exposure to RF radiation (10 MHz) and the industrial solvent, 2-methoxyethanol (2ME), enhanced teratogenicity in rats. Interactions were noted at even the lowest levels of 2ME tested, but only at hyperthermic levels of RF radiation. The purpose of the present research is to investigate if the interactive effects noted for RF radiation and 2ME are unique to these agents, or if similar interactions might be seen with other chemicals. Because methanol is widely used as a solvent as well as fuel additive, and, at high levels, is teratogenic in animals, we selected methanol as a chemical to address generalizability. Based on the literature and our pilot studies, 0, 2, or 3 g/kg methanol (twice, at 6-hr intervals) were administered on gestation day 9 or 13 to groups of 10 Sprague-Dawley rats. Dams treated on day 9 were given methanol and exposed to RF radiation sufficient to maintain colonic temperature at 41 \u00b0C for 60 minutes (or sham). Those treated on day 13 were given methanol plus either 0 or 100 mg/kg 2ME. Because we observed that methanol produced hypothermia, some groups were given the initial dose of methanol concurrently with the RF or 2ME, and others were given the first dose of methanol 1.5 hr prior to RF or 2ME. Dams were sacrificed on gestation day 20, and the fetuses were examined for external malformations. The results indicate that RF radiation or methanol on day 9 increased the incidence of resorbed fetuses, but no interactive effects were observed. The resorptions were highest in groups given the experimental treatments 1.5 hr apart. The higher dose of methanol also reduced fetal weights. Administration of 2ME or methanol on day 13 increased the rate of malformations, and there was evidence of a positive interaction between 2ME and methanol. Fetal weights were reduced by 2ME and methanol alone, but no interaction was observed. Also, separation of the dosing with the teratogens did not affect the results."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ ... Rat and mouse whole embryo cultures are used to distinguish toxicity of methanol (CH3OH) and its metabolites, formaldehyde (HCHO) and formate (HCOONa), which are produced following transit through the visceral yolk sac (VYS), via addition to culture medium, or by direct embryonic exposure through microinjection into the amnion. Embryonic viability, increased dysmorphogenesis, and decreased growth parameters were altered in a dose-dependent fashion for each compound. Mouse embryos were more sensitive than rat, as indicated by significant decreases in viability at comparable, lower concentrations. HCHO produced dysmorphogenesis and caused embryolethality at nearly 1000-fold lower concentrations (0.004 mg/mL) than seen with either CH3OH or HCOONa. All agents produced incomplete axial rotation and delayed neural tube closure in mice, but only CH3OH elicited similar effects in the rat. Increased growth retardation, blood pooling in the head and VYS, enlarged pericardium, accumulation of necrotic matter in the amnion, and hypoplastic prosencephalon were observed in both species with all compounds. Microinjection of compounds into the amnion produced higher mortality in mouse and rat, compared to equimolar amounts added to the culture medium. CH3OH did not prevent neural tube closure in the rat when microinjected. HCHO is the most embryotoxic CH3OH metabolite and elicits the entire spectrum of lesions produced by CH3OH. The VYS serves a general protective role against toxicity and inherent differences in the embryonic metabolism of CH3OH may determine species sensitivity."

The two-cohort study design used 48 adult female Macaca fascicularis (24/cohort) monkeys exposed to 0, 200, 600, or 1800 ppm MeOH vapor for approximately 2.5 hr/day, 7 days/week prior to breeding and throughout pregnancy. Maternal body weight measurement, clinical observations and health assessments were conducted routinely throughout the study. Menstrual cyclicity was monitored during the pre-breeding and breeding periods and timed matings were conducted with nonexposed males. Females were monitored closely during the last month of pregnancy. At birth, infant physical characteristics were measured and a newborn health assessment was conducted. Methanol exposure did not alter menstrual cycles, the number of breedings to conception or conception rate. A total of 34 live-born infants were delivered (control=8, 200 ppm=9, 600 ppm=8, 1800 ppm=9). One female each in the control and 600-ppm group delivered a stillborn infant and a cesarean section (C-section) was required to deliver a hydrocephalic infant who died in utero in the maternal 1800-ppm group. Although not statistically significant, five MeOH-exposed females were C-sectioned due to pregnancy complications such as uterine bleeding and prolonged unproductive labor. These complications were not observed in the control group. The mean length of pregnancy in the MeOH-exposed groups was significantly decreased by 6 to 8 days when compared to controls. There were no MeOH-related effects on offspring birthweight or newborn health status. The consistent reduction in length of pregnancy observed in the MeOH females may reflect a treatment effect on the fetal neuroendocrine system. Given that the fetal hypothalamic--pituitary-adrenal axis controls pregnancy length in most species, these results suggest a modest but significant effect of MeOH on the biochemical events that control the timing of birth."

Intrinsic differences in the metabolism of CH(3)OH to formaldehyde (HCHO) and formic acid (HCOOH) by the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH3), and catalase may contribute to the observed species sensitivity. Specific activities for enzymes involved in CH(3)OH metabolism were determined in rat and mouse conceptuses during the organogenesis period of 8-25 somites. Spatial activity relationships were also compared separately in heads, hearts, trunks, and the visceral yolk sac (VYS) from early (7-12 somites) and late (20-22 somites) organogenesis-stage rat and mouse embryos. Catalase activities were similar between rat and mouse conceptuses. In the mouse heart, catalase activities were consistently lower when compared to other tissues. Specific activities for catalase were consistently highest in the VYS of both species when compared to other tissues of the embryo. These activities were highly significant in the 6-12 somite VYS. ADH1 activities were significantly higher in embryos when compared to VYS in both species, except for a 27% lower activity in the early 8-10 somite mouse embryo. Mouse ADH1 activities in the VYS were significantly lower throughout the organogenesis period when compared to the rat VYS or embryos of either species. Mouse activities were lower overall in specific tissues of the embryo but maintained the same relative proportions as in the rat. ADH3 activities in the rat VYS were significantly higher by 20% than those in the mouse. Mouse embryo ADH3 activities were slow to mature, starting at a level 42% below rat, and failed to reach optimal levels until the 14-16-somite stage. Heart ADH3 activities were also significantly lower in the mouse embryo at the 7-12-somite stage. Both species have lower ADH3 activities in the early heart, relative to other embryonic tissues. These results show a more slowly maturing capacity of the mouse embryo to remove HCHO, which provides a rationale for increased sensitivity of this species to CH(3)OH-induced embryotoxicity and teratogenicity."

Normally, the flexor chronaxia is shorter than the extensor chronaxia, and their ratio is stated to be relatively stable. /One study/ ... reported that the average chronaxia ratio for rats exposed in the high-dose group (49.77 mg/cu m) for 12 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 3 months, differed significantly from that in the control group of animals at week 8 of exposure. The average chronaxia ratio returned to normal during the recovery period and the effects in the low-dose group (1.77 mg/cu m) were insignificant. Histopathological changes found in the high-dose group, but not in the low-dose group, included poorly defined changes in the mucous membranes of the trachea and bronchi, hyperplasia of the submucosa of the trachea, slight lymphoid infiltration, swelling and hypertrophy of the muscle layer of arteries, slight degenerative changes to the liver and changes in the neurons of the cerebral cortex. /The second study/... reported that male rats exposed continuously for 90 days to a concentration of 5.3 mg/cu m (4 ppm) of methanol vapor, exhibited changes in chronaxia ratio between antagonistic muscles, in whole blood cholinesterase activity, in urinary excretion of coproporphyrin and in albumin-globulin ratio of the serum. Male rats exposed to 0.57 mg/cu m (0.4 ppm) of methanol vapor continuously for 90 days showed no changes. It should be noted, however, that an analysis of these studies ... indicated that, due to flaws in the study designs, these studies do not provide adequate evidence of an association between neurobehavioral effects and low-level exposure to methanol. Both studies were limited by the use of small numbers of animals per dose group, as well as insufficient reporting of experimental methods, study results and statistical analysis. /It was/ ... also stated that the biological significance of changes in the chronaxia ratio is uncertain."

A gradual loss in the body weight gain was observed in the pups exposed to 2% and 4% methanol in the FD group, while FS group exhibited this alteration only at 4% exposure. The assessment of spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) showing a significant increase in the distance travelled was observed in the 2% and 4% methanol-exposed groups in both the FS and FD animals when compared with their respective controls, but the effect was more marked in the FD group. A significant decrease in the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) was observed in pups exposed to 2% and 4% methanol in the FD group at PND 45. The results also suggest that disturbances in dopaminergic and cholinergic receptors were more pronounced in the FD group as compared to the FS group. A significant decrease in striatal dopamine levels was also observed in the FD group at 2% and 4% methanol exposure, while in the FS group, a significant decrease was exhibited only at 4% methanol exposure. An aberrant increase in the expression of Growth-Associated Protein (GAP-43), a neuron-specific growth-associated protein was observed in pups in the FD group exposed to 2% and 4% methanol, while an increase in the expression of GAP-43 in the FS group was found only at 4% methanol exposure in the hippocampal region as compared to their respective controls."

Developmental neurotoxicity of pregnant Long-Evans rats and their newborn offspring exposed to 5900 mg/cu m (4500 ppm) of methanol by inhalation for 6 hr daily /was studied/, beginning on gestation day 6, with both dams and pups then being exposed through postnatal day 21. Although findings suggested significant functional consequences in rats resulting from this exposure, these consequences were considered subtle in character. Exposure to 5900 mg methanol/cu m did not affect the suckling time and conditioned olfactory aversion test of newborn rats. Methanol exposed newborn pups were less active on postnatal day 18 and more active on postnatal day 25 than control newborn pups (motor activity test). The study found only isolated positive results that were small and variable. The two adult assays, the fixed-ratio wheel-running test and the stochastic discrimination test, yielded evidence of a significant methanol effect. No evidence of brain damage emerged on the basis of neuropathology, although differences in neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) arising from methanol exposure were observed in neonatal cerebella. Methanol treatment caused a decrease in expression in both NCAM 140 and NCAM 180."

At delivery, the litters culled to four offspring of each sex, were kept in the exposure chambers with the dams up to weaning, postnatal day (PND) 21. The offspring were evaluated as neonates for their ability to find a dam's nipple in the suckling test administered on PND5 and olfactory aversion using orange-oil and methyl-salicylate as odorants on PND10. Motor activity was evaluated on PND18 and PND25. The offspring were evaluated as adults by measuring their performance in two operant conditioning paradigms: running a specific number of revolutions in a rotating field for a feed pellet reward (running wheel test) and performing a complex lever pressing task for a feed pellet reward (stochastic spatial discrimination learning (SSDL) test). Methanol exposure did not affect performance in the suckling or odor aversion test. The exposed rats showed lower levels of motor activity on PND18, but higher levels of activity on PND25. When tested as adults, methanol exposed male rats showed decreases in the rate of running in the running wheel test compared to their baseline performance. Exposed females showed increased rates of running. Methanol exposed rats of both sexes showed impaired performance on the SSDL test at asymptotic levels of performance. /It was concluded/... that exposure to 4,500ppm methanol vapor during early development produces subtle changes in behavior in both neonatal and adult rats."

In contrast, the concentrations of formate in the brain were significantly lower than blood formate concentrations. These data suggest that the toxic actions of methanol on the visual system may be due to the selective accumulation of formate in the vitreous humor and the retina as compared with other regions of the CNS. Secondly, the retina has a very limited metabolic capacity to oxidize and thus detoxify formate. Thirdly, cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP concentrations have been shown to be selectively reduced in the retina, optic nerve and brain in methanol-intoxicated rats, suggesting that there may be tissue- and cell-specific differences in mitochondrial populations and in the actions of formate on mitochondrial function. Finally, in vitro studies in isolated retinal and cardiac mitochondria have shown that formate selectively inhibits retinal mitochondrial ATP synthesis. These findings support the hypothesis that formate acts as a selective mitochondrial toxin in the retina and establish a link between the effects of formate in vitro and the retinal toxicity associated with formate accumulation in methanol intoxication."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Methanol is among the most common short-chain alcohols in fermenting fruits, the natural food and oviposition sites of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our previous results showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) were associated with methanol detoxification in the larvae. Catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), esterases (ESTs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were specifically inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethylmeleate (DEM), respectively. CYPs were inhibited by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT). In the present paper, the involvements of these enzymes in methanol metabolism were investigated in female and male adults by determining the combination indices of methanol and their corresponding inhibitors. When PBO, 1-ABT, 3-AT, 4-MP and TPP were individually mixed with methanol, they exhibited significant synergism to the mortality of the adults after 72 hr of dietary exposure. In contrast, the DEM and methanol mixture showed additive effects. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity and up-regulated mRNA expression levels of several Cyp genes. Bioassays using different strains revealed that the variation in ADH activity and RNAi-mediated knockdown of alpha-Est7 significantly changed LC50 values for methanol. These results suggest that CYPs, catalases, ADHs and ESTs are partially responsible for methanol elimination in adults. It seems that there are some differences in methanol metabolism between larvae and adults, but not between female and male adults."

The FEP is a measure of the functional integrity of the primary visual pathway from the retina to the visual cortex and the ERG is a global measure of retinal function in response to illumination. The FEP was progressively diminished in methanol intoxicated rats, indicative of a disruption of neuronal conduction along the primary visual pathway from the retina to the visual cortex. ERG analysis in methanol-intoxicated rats revealed a significant early deficit in b-wave amplitude, followed by a temporally delayed lesser reduction in a-wave amplitude. The b-wave of the ERG is generated by depolarization of the Muller glial cells and reflects synaptic activity at the level of the bipolar cells. The b-wave of the ERG is extremely sensitive to conditions that interfere with retinal energy metabolism and is reduced or abolished following brief ischemia or the administration of metabolic poisons. Both FEP and ERG alterations occurred at the same time as accumulation of blood formate, indicative of a causal relationship between formate-induced metabolic and visual disturbances. Similar ERG reductions have been reported in methanol-intoxicated primates and in human methanol intoxication."
