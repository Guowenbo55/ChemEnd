The uptake was rapid in the first 24 hrs and then leveling off to a plateau after 72 hr. When the fish were transferred to fresh water, levels of acrylamide declined to 75% of the initial concentration after 96 hr(1)."

In order to access the efficiency of sewage works in removing acrylamide, two sewage works were dosed for four times longer than the residence time(5). Little loss of acrylamide occurred during initial or final settling. However 50 to 70% was lost in the activated sludge plants. Further studies showed that high loss rates required high microbial activity or, in particular, contact with surfaces of high microbial activity(5). Acrylamide, present at 100 mg/L, reached 70% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the modified Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(6). Using OECD Guideline 301D (Ready Biodegradability: Closed Bottle Test) and a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum, acrylamide reached 67 and 98.1% of its theoretical BOD in 15 and 28 days respectively which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(7).

In this study, we first investigated the effects of acrylamide (ACR) on slow axonal transport of neurofilaments in cultured rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons through live-cell imaging approach. Then for the underlying mechanisms exploration, the protein level of neurofilament subunits, motor proteins kinesin and dynein, and dynamitin subunit of dynactin in DRG neurons were assessed by western blotting and the concentrations of ATP was detected using the ATP Assay Kit. The results showed that ACR treatment results in a dose-dependent decrease of slow axonal transport of neurofilaments. Furthermore, ACR intoxication significantly increases the protein levels of the three neurofilament subunits (NF-L, NF-M, NF-H), kinesin, dynein, and dynamitin subunit of dynactin in DRG neurons. In addition, ATP level decreased significantly in ACR-treated DRG neurons. Our findings indicate that ACR exposure retards slow axonal transport of NF-M, and suggest that the increase of neurofilament cargoes, motor proteins, dynamitin of dynactin, and the inadequate ATP supply contribute to the ACR-induced retardation of slow axonal transport."

            "Value": "Acrylamide produces a central-peripheral distal axonopathy when administered chronically. This is characterized functionally by decreases in the monosynaptic reflex and dorsal root potential and alterations in the characteristics of the dorsal root reflex. Acute administration of acrylamide inhibits the oxidative enzyme complex nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form)-tetrazolium reductase and slows retrograde axoplasmic transport. This study was carried out to determine if the spinal cord reflexes are also affected following acute administration of acrylamide. Dose response studies revealed a dose-dependent increase in both the monosynaptic reflex and dorsal root reflex. A single injection of 50 mg/kg acrylamide caused an increase in both the monosynaptic reflex and dorsal root reflex within 15 min and continued for over 3 hr. These data are paradoxical since chronic administration of acrylamide results in decreased function. Two possible mechanisms are proposed. First, calcium ion regulation may be involved in both the acute and chronic effects of acrylamide on spinal cord reflexes. Second, a depolarization of the neurons is occurring just prior to cell injury or death."

The control group was administrated with 0.9% NaCl by i.p. injection and gavaged with 0.9% NaCl. The NAC group was administrated with 200 mg/kg NAC by injection and gavaged with 0.9% NaCl. The ACR group was administrated with 0.9% NaCl by injection and gavaged with 40 mg/kg ACR. The combined treatment group was administrated with 200 mg/kg NAC by i.p. injection and gavaged with 40 mg/kg ACR. The rats were administrated once a day for 2 weeks. After 24 hours of the last administration, the rats were decapitated. The blood was collected, the liver and kidney were separated. The body weight, organ coefficient and serum biochemical parameters were measured, and the pathological changes of the tissues were examined with a microscope. Then the expression of NF-kappaB p65, IkappaB-alpha and COX-2 were detected by Western blot. From the second day to the end of the exposure, the body weight of rats in the ACR group was statistically lower than that in the control group (p<0.05). Compared with the combined treatment group, the body weight in the ACR group statistically decreased in the second and third days (p<0.05). The liver and kidney organ coefficients in the ACR group were (4.159% +/- 0.371%) and (0.764% +/- 0.068%) respectively, which increased statistically when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The contents of ALT, AST and Cr in the serum in the ACR group were (77.370 +/- 16.397) U/L, (379.410 +/- 57.817) U/L, and (77.812 +/- 6.391) umol/L respectively, which were not significantly different with those in the control group and the combined treatment group (p>0.05). The content of bloor irea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum in the ACR group was (7.005 +/- 1.009) mmol/L, which was statistically higher than that in the control group (p<0.05).

Liver samples were fixed in formalin, routinely processed for paraffin embedding, sectioning and histochemical staining. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections showed an increase in the volume of hepatocytes, their nuclei and cytoplasm in both AA-treated groups compared to the control. In Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stained sections in low-dose group was noticed glycogen reduction, while in high-dose group was present its accumulation compared to the control, respectively. Serum analysis showed increased activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and decreased activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in both AA-treated groups, while the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased in low-dose, but decreased in high-dose group compared to the control, respectively. Present results suggest a prominent hepatotoxic potential of AA which might alter the microstructural features and functional status in hepatocytes of immature liver."

We have tested the hypothesis that a combination of prebiotic supplements during gestation has the propensity to attenuate acrylamide (ACR) induced oxidative impairments, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity in maternal and fetal brain of rats. To achieve this, pregnant dams given oral supplements of a combination of fructo- and xylooligosaccharides (FOS + XOS, 3 g/kg/day) during gestation days (GD 0-19) were exposed to ACR (200 ppm in drinking water, GD 6-19). The behavioral analysis revealed that ACR dams fed prebiotics displayed higher exploratory behavior in the open field test. The prenatal evaluation showed that ACR-induced decrements of placental/fetal weights were markedly restored with prebiotic feeding. Prebiotics significantly offset markers of oxidative stress, restored enzymic antioxidants, cholinergic and mitochondrial function in the maternal and fetal brain. Concomitantly, prebiotics restored ACR-induced depletion in the levels of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in the maternal cortex that positively correlated with cecal bacterial numbers. Collectively, these data suggest that prenatal prebiotic oligosaccharide supplements protect developing brain against oxidative stress-mediated neurotoxicity. While the underlying mechanism/s by which prebiotics abrogate the impact of neurotoxicants in the developing brain merits further studies, we speculate that it may be mediated predominantly through attenuation of oxidative stress and proliferation of enteric microbiota."

(5) After acrylamide feeding, the litter sizes of acrylamide-treated mice were significantly smaller compared to thus of control mice. Thus, our results indicated that acrylamide might affect oocyte quality through its effects on cytoskeletal integrity, ROS generation, apoptosis induction, and epigenetic modifications."

While acrylamide is unreactive with DNA, it is readily oxidized to glycidamide, which adducts with DNA. This metabolism occurs via the enzyme, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily E, and polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1). Acrylamide was administered to male CD1 mice for three or six months at a dose of 0.18 mg/kg body weight/day. DNA damage was detected in germ cells and mature spermatozoa of exposed mice without compromising their overall fertility. The use of resveratrol, an antioxidant and known CYP2E1 inhibitor, was found to ameliorate the DNA damage in both germ cells and spermatozoa. However, extended resveratrol treatment (six months, 10.0 mg/kg body weight/week) resulted in premature activation of these cells. Thus the DNA damage found in spermatozoa after chronic acrylamide administration can be alleviated but an alternative CYP2E1 inhibitor may be required."

Maternal toxicity during acrylamide exposure was expressed primarily by decreased weight gain at the high dose. Maternal weight gain during treatment and gestation as well as weight gain corrected for gravid uterine weight exhibited decreasing trends. Maternal weight gain during treatment was reduced below control values in the high dose group, and corrected weight gain was reduced in the 7.5 and 15 mg/kg dose groups. Gravid uterine and liver weights were not measurably affected by acrylamide treatment. In addition, other clinical signs were observed infrequently and exhibited no clear-cut relationship to acrylamide dose. Acrylamide treatment during gestation did not alter measured endpoints of embryo/fetal viability, growth or development. The percentages of resorptions, dead fetuses or malformed fetuses per litter, as well as fetal body weights, were statistically similar among the dose groups. Acrylamide treatment had no effect on the incidence of skeletal visceral or external malformations. There was a dose-related trend toward an increased incidence of variations, but there were no statistically significant pairwise comparisons. In conclusion, development of the CD rat was not sensitive to acrylamide administered by gavage at doses which depressed maternal weight gain. The lowest acrylamide dose administered, 2.5 mg/kg/day, represented a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for acrylamide-induced maternal toxicity. Embryo/fetal toxicity was not observed across the doses of acrylamide administered in this study.

The goal was to attempt to define the chronology of onset of these toxicities during exposure to low doses of ACRL, and separate the neurotoxicity from the reproductive toxicity. Dose levels were 3, 10, and 30 ppm in water. Clinical signs of toxicity were minimal at these low doses of ACRL and consisted only of increased water consumption for males at Weeks 1 and 16 and decreased water consumption for high-dose females at Week 1. Non dose-related decreases in water consumption were observed at Week 27. Feed consumption was normal as were male and female body weights throughout the study. Overall, forelimb and hind limb grip strength tests administered at various times to detect neurotoxicity in the F0 males and females were all normal. Exposure to ACRL at doses ranging from 0.72+/-0.05 mg/kg/day in the low-dose group (3 ppm) to 9.16+/-0.23 mg/kg/day in the high-dose group (30 ppm), for 27 wks did not significantly affect measures of reproductive competence, including initial fertility, mean number of litters/pair, the proportion of pups born alive, or adjusted live pup weight. However, overall live litter size was reduced by slightly more than one pup/litter at 30 ppm. A dominant lethal test was performed using the F0 males after approx 20 wks of ACRL treatment, resulting in increased postimplantation (early resorption) loss of one pup/litter at 30 ppm. A crossover mating trial was not sensitive enough to determine which sex was responsible for the reduced number of pups/litter. The number of live pups per litter tended to be lower when sires were treated with 30 ppm ACRL (control x control; 11.4 +/- 0.6 vs. ACRL male x control females: 9.4 +/- 1.3), but this was not significant. At necropsy of F0 adults no dose-related trends in reproductive or somatic organ or body weights were noted. Testicular spermatid numbers were decreased (11%) in mid- and high-dose mice. No treatment-related neural (sural and gastrocnemius nerves) or somatic organ histopathology was observed. ACRL at dose levels of </= to 30 ppm in water did not adversely affect pre-weaning growth or survival of the F1 generation, nor was there an effect on feed consumption before 82+/-10 days of age. Calculated exposure averaged 6.7+/-0.3 and 8.8+/-0.3 mg/kg/day for adult 82-day-old F1 males and females, respectively. Water consumption was increased at 30 ppm by 110 days of age for both sexes. No treatment-related clinical signs were noted. ACRL at 30 ppm had significant effects on the reproductive competence of the F1 generation, causing a 47% reduction in the number of F2 pups/litter. Some evidence of neurotoxicity was noted in the F1 generation at 10 and 30 ppm, as forelimb and hind limb grip strength was reduced in males at 10 and 16 wks of age, respectively. Grip strength was not affected in females. There was no evidence of treatment effect on F1 body or organ weights, sperm parameters, or histopathology in males, except for smaller absolute prostate weights at 30 ppm. In females, terminal body weight was not reduced, and ACRL had no affect on reproductive organ weight, vaginal cytology, or histopathology. An indication of general toxicity occurred in F1 females: absolute kidney/adrenal weight was decreased, and relative liver weight was increased at >/= 10 ppm. In summary, exposure to ACRL in water at dose levels of 30 ppm (9.2 mg/kg) resulted in slight reproductive toxicity (decreased pups/litter and spermatid head counts) and increased postimplantation loss (dominant lethal effect) in the absence of demonstrable neurotoxicity for the F0 animals. F1 animals dosed with 30 ppm ACRL were more severely affected than the F0 animals, exhibiting a more profound effect on fertility in the presence of slight neurotoxicity (decreased grip strength in males)."

A differential sensitivity of the enzymes to the inhibitory effects of the neurotoxins was observed. The order of increasing sensitivity to 2,5-hexanedione was enolase - GAPDH - PFK and to acrylamide the order was PFK - enolase - GAPDH. Neither neurotoxin inhibited LDH. The inhibition of enolase by acrylamide exhibited a mixed type pattern in double reciprocal plots. The inhibition could be completely reversed by dialysis indicating that it did not involve covalent bond formation. In the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione the inhibition of enolase by either acrylamide or 2,5-hexanedione was potentiated. Activity of enolase inhibited by both acrylamide and DTT could not be restored to pre-inhibition rates following dialysis indicating that an irreversible interaction between acrylamide and enolase had taken place. The results suggest that neurotoxic compounds which produce distal axonopathies have a common pattern of attack on glycolytic enzymes and that interruption of glycolysis is the underlying biochemical basis for both the physiological and morphological damage caused by these compounds."

Following intramuscular injection, rats were given intraperitoneal injection of 3% acrylamide every 3 days for 21 days. Nerve sprouting appeared 2 weeks after intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin type A and single-fiber electromyography revealed abnormal conduction at the neuromuscular junction 1 week after intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin type A. Following intraperitoneal injection of acrylamide, the peak muscle fiber density decreased. Electromyography jitter value were restored to normal levels 6 weeks after injection. This indicates that the maximal decrease in fiber density and the time at which functional conduction of neuromuscular junction was restored were delayed. Additionally, the increase in tibial nerve fibers was reduced. Acrylamide inhibits nerve sprouting caused by botulinum toxin type A and may be used to prolong the clinical dosage of botulinum toxin type A."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, we showed that 48 hr exposure to 10-625 mg/L acrylamide resulted in a significant decline in locomotor frequency of body bending, head thrashing and pharynx pumping. In addition, acrylamide exposure reduced crawling speeds and changed angles of body bending. It indicates that acrylamide induces locomotor defects, along with parkinsonian-like movement impairment, including bradykinesia and hypokinesia. Acrylamide also affected chemotaxis plasticity and reduced learning ability. Using transgenic nematodes, we found that acrylamide induced downexpression of P(dat-1) and led to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, the enhanced expression of unc-54, encoding a subunit of alpha-synuclein was found. It illustrates that acrylamide is efficient in inducing crucial parkinsonian pathology, including dopaminergic damage and alpha-synuclein aggregation. These findings suggest the acrylamide-induced locomotor defects and neurotoxicity are associated with Parkinson's disease."

The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) has an increasingly important role in the dopaminergic system. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate effects of ACR on dopamine and its metabolite levels, dopamine transport and metabolic gene expression in dopaminergic neurons. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were dosed orally with ACR at 0 (saline), 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg/day for 20 days. Splayed hind limbs, reduced tail flick time and abnormal gait which preceded other neurologic parameters were observed in the above rats. ACR significantly increased dopamine levels, decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA) contents in an area dependent manner in rat striatum. Immunohistochemical staining of the striatum revealed that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells significantly increased, while monoamine oxidase (MAO) positive cells were drastically reduced, which was consistent with changes in their mRNA and protein expressions. In addition, dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression levels were both down-regulated in the striatum. These results suggest that dopamine levels increase significantly in response to ACR, presumably due to changes in the dopamine transport and metabolism related genes expression in the striatal dopaminergic neurons."

Using the segmental analysis of radioactive label of proteins following 3H-leucine injections into the DRG, ACR (50-100 mg/kg) significantly reduced the rate of fast anterograde transport by 9.3 to 20.8% but, more importantly, reduced the quantity of transported protein by 42.4 to 51.3%. The non-neurotoxic analogue methylene bis-acrylamide did not significantly change either parameter. The reductions in transport were not due to general effects of the toxicant upon protein synthesis. Therefore, fast anterograde transport was significantly affected by a single exposure to ACR in the same magnitude as retrograde transport. Discovery of these dramatic changes was due to differences from previous studies in the time frame of study of transport in relation to toxicant injection and to measurements of the quantity of protein transported rather than only the rate.

To continue morphological examination of ACR neurotoxicity in CNS, a cupric silver stain method was used to define spatiotemporal characteristics of nerve cell body, dendrite, axon and terminal degeneration in brainstem and spinal cord. Rats were exposed to ACR at a dose-rate of either 50 mg/kg per day (i.p.) or 21 mg/kg per day (p.o.), and at selected times brains and spinal cord were removed and processed for silver staining. Results show that intoxication at the higher ACR dose-rate produced a nearly pure terminalopathy in brainstem and spinal cord regions, i.e. widespread nerve terminal degeneration and swelling were present in the absence of significant argyrophilic changes in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or axons. Exposure to the lower ACR dose-rate caused initial nerve terminal argyrophilia in selected brainstem and spinal cord regions. As intoxication continued, axon degeneration developed in white matter of these CNS areas. At both dose-rates, argyrophilic changes in brainstem nerve terminals developed prior to the onset of significant gait abnormalities. In contrast, during exposure to the lower ACR dose-rate the appearance of axon degeneration in either brainstem or spinal cord was relatively delayed with respect to changes in gait. Thus, regardless of dose-rate, ACR intoxication produced early, progressive nerve terminal degeneration. Axon degeneration occurred primarily during exposure to the lower ACR dose-rate and developed after the appearance of terminal degeneration and neurotoxicity. Spatiotemporal analysis suggested that degeneration began at the nerve terminal and then moved as a function of time in a somal direction along the corresponding axon. These data suggest that nerve terminals are a primary site of ACR action and that expression of axonopathy is restricted to subchronic dosing-rates."

Senescent cells show dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes and other regulators of cellular proliferation. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a pleiotropic role in biological processes through genotoxic stress. In this study, we examined the effects of acrylamide (ACR), a genotoxic carcinogen, on cellular senescence and the molecular mechanisms of ATF3 function in macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with ACR at low concentrations (<1.0 mM) resulted in senescence-like morphology and an increase in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity. Exposure of macrophages to ACR led to stress-induced, telomerase-independent senescence. In addition, ACR treatment for 1, 3, or 5 days showed a concentration-dependent increase in ATF3 expression and G0/G1 phase arrest. To better understand the role of ATF3 in controlling the senescence response to ACR, SA-beta-gal activity was examined using ATF3 knockdown and overexpression. ACR-mediated senescence was significantly decreased by knockdown of ATF3, whereas it was increased with ATF3 overexpression. We found that ATF3 regulated p53 and p21 levels. ATF3 also played an important role in regulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in response to ACR treatment. Moreover, phosphorylation of p38 and JNK kinases, which were activated during ATF3-mediated senescence, was observed in ACR-treated macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that ATF3 contributes to ACR-induced senescence by enhancing ROS production, activating p38 and JNK kinases, and promoting the ATF3-dependent expression of p53, resulting in regulation of cellular senescence in macrophages."

ACR treatment resulted in DNA damage in the liver, but not in the bone marrow. While ACR was not a clastogen, it was a weak (equivocal) mutagen in the cells of bone marrow. GMA caused DNA damage in the cells of bone marrow, liver and kidney, and induced MN reticulocytes and Pig-a mutant RBCs in a dose-dependent manner.

In contrast, acrylamide induced a dose-dependent increase in micronucleus formation but tested negative in the Pig-a assay in mice. Higher plasma concentrations of glycidamide in mice than rats are hypothesized to explain, at least in part, the differences in the response. Benchmark dose modelling indicates that structural DNA damage as opposed to point mutations is most relevant to the genotoxic mode of action of acrylamide-induced carcinogenicity.

ACR promoted the translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) from the cytosol to the nucleus, thereby enhancing the expression of downstream gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS). The regulation of Nrf2 activation by MAPK pathways was confirmed by the blockade of MAPK pathways. The suppression of JNK and p38 pathways showed a protective effect on ACR-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

This study examined the redox-dependent apoptotic and inflammatory responses of acrylamide (ACR) in an immortalized mouse microglia cell line BV2. The exposure of BV2 cells to ACR reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. ACR impaired cell energy metabolism by decreasing mitochondrial respiration, anaerobic glycolysis, and lowering expression of the complex I, III, and IV subunits. Mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, thus resulting in activation of the mitochondrion-driven apoptotic signaling. This was accompanied by (a) the modulation of redox-sensitive signaling, suppressed Akt activation and increased JNK and p38 activation, and (b) increased expression of NFkappaB and downstream inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide generation, thus supporting indirectly a proinflammatory effect of ACR. Nrf2 expression was also increased but not its translocation to the nucleus. Expectedly, the electrophilic attack of ACR on GSH resulted in substantial loss of GSH with a minor GSSG formation. These changes in the cell's redox status elicited by ACR resulted in increased H2O2 formation. The changes in mitochondrial functionality and complex subunit expression caused by ACR were reversed by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Likewise, NAC restored the cell's redox status by increasing GSH levels with concomitant attenuation of H2O2 generation; these effects resulted in decreased apoptotic cell death and inflammatory responses. ACR-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction along with a more oxidized redox status seems to be critical events leading to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and inflammatory responses."

The present study intended to correlate the role of key polymorphic genes of apoptosis (CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, LTA and TNFRSF1B) with biomarkers of effect of DNA damage, namely the sister chromatid exchange assay (SCE) and the comet assay in whole blood cells exposed to GA. The aim was to assess as a proof of concept the role that pro-apoptotic effector proteins might have in the yields of genotoxic effects when those effector proteins are coded by polymorphic genes. Whole blood from a small group of volunteers was exposed to GA to assess DNA damage and the volunteers were genotyped for polymorphic genes related to apoptosis pathways. A relation between the induction of SCE and several variants of the polymorphism CASP8 rs1035142 G>T was observed. Also, a relation between the % tail DNA and the CASP10 I522L polymorphism was found. Furthermore, associations between % tail DNA and several SNP-SNP interactions of CASP8 and CASP10 were found. A possible correlation between DNA damage and the genetic susceptibility, bestowed by polymorphic genes in the apoptosis inducing pathways was verified. /Glycidamide/"

A total of 200 female mice weighing 18-22 g were randomly divided into four clusters based on body weight, and each weight-based cluster included five groups (10 mice per group): negative control, positive control (cyclophosphamide), low, intermediate, and high dose ACR groups, and all the groups were administered ACR by gavage for 30 days. At the end of the study, the immunotoxicological effects of the ACR were evaluated through immunopathology, humoral immunity, cellular immunity, and non-specific immunity. The terminal body weight, spleen and thymus weights, lymphocyte counts in the ACR-H group were decreased, pathological changes were observed in lymph glands, thymus and spleen. %T cells in blood lymphocytes were significantly increased in all ACR-treated groups, and a significant reduction of % natural killer (NK) cells and increase of %Th cells were observed in the ACR-H group. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Concanavalin A(ConA)-induced splenocyte proliferation and serum half hemolysis value (HC50) were also significantly suppressed in the ACR-H group. ..."

They showed clinical signs of impaired nerve function, mainly in the hindlegs, with varying degrees of weakness and ataxia. The animals were irritable, nervous and hypersensitive to touch. Both pupils of the most badly affected animal were dilated and it had poor pupillary light responses; it also showed signs of axonal neuropathy. Selected hematological and clinical chemistry variables were normal. The severity of the neurological signs was correlated with the concentrations of hemoglobin adducts of acrylamides. The animals recovered substantially after their exposure. The gestations of four of the animals which were in calf proceeded normally."

We sought to characterize the dose-dependent effects of acrylamide on various properties, including cell morphology, contraction patterns, and junctional connexin 43 staining, in primary cardiomyocytes. We show that several days' exposure to 1-100 uM acrylamide resulted in altered morphology, irregular contraction patterns, and an increase in the amount of immunoreactive signal for connexin 43 at cell junctions. We conclude that dietary levels of acrylamide may alter cellular function with prolonged exposure, in primary cardiomyocytes."

Functional and structural properties of lipoproteins were modified by AA (final concentration of 5-100 mM) with loss of antioxidant ability and multimerization of apoA-I in vitro. AA exacerbated LDL oxidation, degradation, and LDL uptake into macrophages with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In human cells, treatment of AA (1-100 uM) caused cellular senescence of dermal cells with severe cytotoxicity. Waterborne exposure of zebrafish in cage water containing AA (300 ppm) resulted in acute death within 26 hr along with elevation of body weight, blood glucose, triglyceride, and hepatic inflammation. AA exposure caused fat accumulation in liver in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, AA affected lipoprotein metabolism to result exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Exposure of zebrafish to AA resulted in acute inflammatory death with hyperlipidemia."

Stomach sections were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative immmunohistochemical assessments of the expression of caspase-3, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EPGR) were performed. Our results showed that acrylamide produced mucosal erosions and depletion of the protective surface mucus together with widespread inflammatory infiltration. In addition, there was significantly increased expression of caspase-3 and iNOS and weak expression of EPGR. Rosemary exerted a protective effect against acrylamide-induced gastric toxicity via reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation as well as accelerating the healing process. ..."

According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that acetamide is expected to have very high to high mobility in soil. No significant adsorption of acrylamide by natural sediments, industrial and sewage sludges, clays (montmorillonite and kaolinite) was observed in adsorption studies(3). In an experiment evaluating leaching using soil TLC (thin-layer chromatography), Rf values ranging from 0.64 to 0.88, measured on four soils, indicated acrylamide is mobile in soil(4). Acrylamide has a higher mobility in sandy soils than in clay soils(4,5)."
