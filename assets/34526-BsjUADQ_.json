    "Description": "Pirimiphos-methyl is an organic thiophosphate that is O,O-dimethyl O-pyrimidin-4-yl phosphorothioate substituted by a methyl group at position 6 and a diethylamino group at position 2. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide, an agrochemical, an insecticide and an environmental contaminant. It is an organic thiophosphate and an aminopyrimidine. It is functionally related to a 2-diethylamino-6-methylpyrimidin-4(1H)-one.",

            "Value": "Pirimiphos-methyl, commercially known as Actellic\u00ae, is an organophosphorus insecticide employed in agricultural practices to combat various insect pests affecting crops. Pirimiphos-methyl does not possess systemic properties. This signifies that its mode of action is primarily confined to the application sites, such as the surfaces of leaves and fruits. This attribute is underscored by its swift dissipation from the treated plant surfaces, a phenomenon corroborated by the study's results. The absence of significant systemic movement implies that pirimiphos-methyl's efficacy and impact are predominantly localized, exerting control over pests directly exposed to the treated areas. Pirimiphos-methyl's influence is largely restricted to its point of application, rather than being extensively transported throughout the plant's vascular system."
