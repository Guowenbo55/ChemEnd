            "content": "The site of uptake, absorption, and distribution of flurazole and acetochlor in grain sorghum plants (Sorghum bicolor \"G-522 DR\") was investigated in laboratory and growth chamber studies conducted at Southern Illinois University. The results showed that acetochlor, which is a herbicide, was primarily absorbed through the shoots of the sorghum plants. The uptake of acetochlor into the plant was rapid and followed a linear pattern. By 7 days, the radiolabeled form of acetochlor (i.e., 14C) was concentrated in the primary roots of the sorghum plants. On the other hand, flurazole, which is a safener, was predominantly taken up by the roots of the sorghum plants. The absorption of radiolabeled flurazole (14C) occurred immediately after application and reached a plateau after 4 days. Similar to acetochlor, the 14C of flurazole was concentrated in the primary roots of the sorghum plants by 7 days. The presence of one chemical did not significantly affect the absorption and distribution of the other chemical in the sorghum plants. This suggests that the uptake and distribution mechanisms of flurazole and acetochlor in grain sorghum are independent of each other. It is worth noting that this information is specific to the experimental conditions and plant species mentioned in the study conducted at Southern Illinois University. The results may vary under different environmental conditions or with other plant species",
