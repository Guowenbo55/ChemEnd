    "Description": "Captan is a dicarboximide that is 3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydrophthalimide in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a trichloromethyl group. A non-systemic fungicide introduced in the 1950s, it is widely used for the control of fungal diseases in fruits, vegetables, and ornamental crops. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of isoindoles, an organochlorine compound, an organosulfur compound and a phthalimide fungicide.",

Following large doses, death is due to cardiac or respiratory failure. With smaller doses death may be delayed and is then apparently caused by infiltrative meningitis secondary to capillary hemorrhages. Animals dying early showed marked hemorrhagic capillary-venous congestion in the stomach, heart, lungs and highly vascular organs, including the thymus.

Therefore, a single i.p. dose of captan (20 mg/kg) was given to male Sprague-Dawley rats and its effect on liver microsomal mixed function oxidases and certain serum enzymes (SDH, SGPT and SGOT) was studied. The single dose of captan caused marked depression of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and the activity of benzphetamine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase, and moderate elevation of the serum enzymes indicative of liver damage. However, reduced glutathione (100 mg/kg, i.p.) given prior to captan, appears to decrease the liver toxicity as measured by reduced inhibition of the microsomal enzymes and elevation of serum enzymes activity. The results suggest that glutathione and other compounds containing sulfhydryl groups may protect the subjects from captan-induced liver toxicity."

Since it was anticipated that there would be reduced food consumption, a pair-fed control group was fed the average amount of food consumed by the mice fed with captan. Clinical observations, body weight and food consumption were measured after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of treatment for five males per group, and the small intestine and stomach were also examined histopathologically at these time-points. One mouse in the treated group and one mouse in the pair-fed group were killed on day 4 due to excessive body-weight loss. Among the mice fed with captan and the pair-fed mice, body weights were significantly reduced. These groups showed a body-weight loss of 2-3% at the end of the study, while a body-weight gain of 11% was observed in the control group. Food consumption was reduced by 37% on the first day of treatment and remained lower than that of controls throughout the first week of treatment. Food consumption was slightly reduced from weeks 2 to 4. In mice fed with captan at a concentration of 3000 ppm for one day, no treatment related abnormalities were observed in the duodenum or any other of the examined tissues. After 3 days of treatment, the duodenum showed crypt cell hyperplasia, shortening of the villi and a general disorganization of the villus enterocytes. In addition, immature cells were seen at the villus tips in all mice fed with captan from day 7 to day 28. In one out of five mice observed at days 3 and 7, gastritis in the glandular portion of the stomach was observed. On day 28, one mouse displayed a focal parakeratosis in the stomach. No treatment-related changes were observed in the jejenum or ileum. It was concluded that crypt cell hyperplasia occurs rapidly after exposure to captan at 3000 ppm. Changes in the villus or crypt cell population preceding the hyperplasia were not observable by routine histological methodology."

We investigated on the hematopoietic system of mice, the effect of a mixture of six pesticides frequently ingested through the intake of fruits and vegetables produced in France (alachlor, captan, diazinon, endosulfan, maneb, mancozeb). The mixture was administered repeatedly by gavage to mice for 4 weeks at levels derived from the human Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) level adapted to the mean weight of mice. Using a NMR-based metabonomic approach, we show that this treatment led to specific gender-linked variations in the level of hepatic metabolites involved in oxidative stress and in the regulation of glucose metabolism, indicating a metabolic signature for this repeated administration. Interestingly, exposure to the low-dose pesticide mixture induced significant changes in the blood cell counts with modifications in the clonogenic and differentiating capacities of hematopoietic progenitors showing abnormalities in the granulocytic and monocytic lineages in female and male mice, respectively. From a molecular point of view, the changes induced by the pesticide treatment correlated with modifications of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signalling pathway, the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and the c-Myc transcription factor, which are involved in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. /These/ results point to a significant effect of a very low dose of a mixture of commonly used pesticides on mice metabolism and hematopoietic system with major differences between males and females."

Duodenums were removed, fixed, and stained with Feulgen/fast green, and sections were examined for aberrant nuclei (apoptotic bodies and micronuclei) in crypts. No induction of nuclear aberrations were observed for any grade or dose of captan or its associated impurities. Captan did not alter the tumorigenic effects of dimethylhydrazine. Pretreatment with L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, which reduced glutathione levels by 55%, did not influence the incidence of nuclear aberrations. /It was/ concluded that the known intestinal carcinogenicity of captan must be induced by some unknown impurity or by an epigenetic mechanism."

Related effects were mucosal hyperplasia in stomach and jejunum (apparently in both sexes at all dose levels), and increased adenomas and adenocarcinomas in the jejunum in 10,000 ppm males. Body weights were reduced (dose-related) in both sexes at all doses. Distended abdomens, presumed to reflect poor nutritional status, were observed in all groups of males, as well as in high dose females.

One group dosed with 6,000 ppm for 12 months was followed after a 6- and 8-month recover. The most characteristic pathological findings consist of necrotizing and proliferative changes in the nonglandular portion of the stomach (after 3 months), dilation of the small intestines, and focal epithelial hyperplasia in the proximal part of the small intestine. Focal epithelial hyperplasia was also found in controls, but the incidence was lower compared to that of the treated animals, and the localization of these foci was more caudual than was the case for captan-administered mice. Diffuse hyperplasia was found only in treated  mice and was not considered prerequisite for the development of focal hyperplasia. Adenomas and adenocarcinomas also developed in the small intestines of treated mice with localization in the proximal 7 cm of the small intestine; the area of localization was the same for focal hyperplasia. Removal of captan from the diet resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of focal epithelial hyperplasia as compared to the incidence in concurrent controls. The incidence of neoplasia, however, in mice in the recovery group was not significantly different from that of concurrent lifetime-treated mice, but increased in mice treated for 6 months with a recovery period of 6 months and in mice treated for 12 months with a recovery period of 6-8 months, respectively, when compared to controls. The latter increase was not found in mice treated for 6 months with a recovery period of 12 months."

The day of insemination was designated day 1 of gestation. On day 30, the animals were sacrificed and maternal and developmental toxicity were examined. The study was performed according to OECD test guideline 414. Body-weight gain and food consumption were reduced in dams at 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day. Body-weight gain during days 7 to 19 of gestation was 238, 205, 57 and 159 g at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day, respectively. Reduction in body-weight gain was most marked during days 7 to 10 of treatment (16, 40, 68 and 143 g at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day, respectively). Food consumption was correspondingly reduced. One female at the highest dose was killed on day 19 after signs of abortion. In dams in all treated groups, a dose-dependent increased incidence of few or no feces and a slightly increased incidence of diarrhea were observed. In one and three dams at the intermediate and highest dose, blood was observed in the urine. On the basis of reduced body-weight gain and reduced food consumption, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg bw per day. Compared with the control group, an increased incidence of post-implantation loss was observed at the highest dose (control, 7%, highest dose, 23%), and the incidences of both early (3% versus 11%) and late intrauterine deaths (4% versus 12%) were increased. The statistically non-significant increase in late intrauterine deaths at the intermediate dose was within the range for historical controls. Mean fetal body weight was decreased by 17% at 100 mg/kg bw per day, which was reflected in a decreased mean gravid uterus weight. At the two higher doses, the incidence of abnormal fetuses was increased. The number of fetuses with one or more major abnormalities at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day was, respectively, 1, 0, 2 and 8. Eight fetuses (out of 86) from five different litters at 100 mg/kg bw per day had at least one major abnormality compared with only one fetus (out of 102) in the control group. Four of the eight affected fetuses at 100 mg/kg bw per day were in the same litter. The type and incidence of major defects at 100 mg/kg bw per day were: gross torso malformations, one; encephalocoele/open eyes/gross malformation of skull, one; mid brain ventricles extremely dilated/cebocephaly, one; maxillae fused, two; pulmonary artery extremely reduced, one; 11th rib and thoric arch absent, one; omphalocoele, one; forepaw extremely flexed, two; and pollex absent-bilateral, one. Two fetuses (out of 75) from two different litters at 30 mg/kg bw per day had one or multiple major abnormalities. The type and incidence of major defects in these two animals at 30 ppm were: microphthalmia, one; fused mandibles, one; pulmonary artery extremely enlarged, one; subclavian artery absent, one; and forepaw extremely flexed, one. These multiple malformations observed in two fetuses in the group receiving the intermediate dose were considered to be incidental. One fetus in the control group had an extremely enlarged aorta. In fetuses in the groups receiving the intermediate and highest doses; an increased incidence of cysts on the liver was found (one, one, five and six at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day, respectively). Also in fetuses in the groups receiving the intermediate and highest doses, increases in the incidences of a number of skeletal variations were observed. Incidences of these variations at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg bw per day were: extra 13th rib with normal length, 61%, 52%, 77% and 78%; 27 pre-sacral vertebrae, 21%, 12%, 57% and 46%, asymmetrical development of 1st and 2nd sacral vertebrae, 2%, 1%, 5% and 7%. At the intermediate and highest doses, slight increases in the incidences of the following variations were also observed: 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th lumbar transverse processes partially ossified; and 3rd lumbar transverse processes partially ossified; odontoid partially ossified. In addition, at the highest dose, the incidence of partially ossified 2nd lumbar transverse processes was increased. Also at the highest dose, the mean manus score was significantly increased, which reflects reduced ossification. On the basis of the increased incidences of variations in fetuses at 30mg/kgbw per day, the NOAEL for embryo/fetotoxicity was 10 mg/kg bw."

Studies which measured the interaction of RNA polymerase with template DNA revealed that the binding of enzyme to DNA was inhibited by captan. Glycerol-gradient sedimentation of the captan-treated RNA polymerase indicated that the inhibition of the enzyme was irreversible and did not result in dissociation of its subunits. These data are consistent with a mechanism in which RNA polymerase activity was irreversibly altered by captan, resulting in an inability of the enzyme to bind to the template.

In a parallel manner, the lymphoblastic stimulation of splenic cells by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied in captan-treated mice and their controls. The stimulation by PHA of splenic cells that were mainly T cells was clearly inhibited (45%) by day 14 of captan ingestion. Thereafter, the inhibition was only partially released until day 42. B cells, stimulated by LPS, presented a decrease in stimulation in captan-treated mice, during the first week of diet (20%). Then an important increase in the stimulation of these cells occurred at day 21 (85%) followed by a return to the normal value at day 42. These results pointed out a clear depressive effect of captan-diet on the immune response of the animals. The inhibition of SRBC-antibody formation during the first stage of the treatment may be correlated to the inhibitory effect of captan on T cells, which were cooperative with B cells for the expression of SRBC-antibody synthesis.

With regard to its effect on the drug-metabolizing enzymes of rat liver, the activity of aniline hydroxylase and the level of cytochrome P-450 were found to decrease in the treated rats 24 hr after a single oral dose (650 mg/kg). The loss was even greater in the animals receiving diethyl maleate 1 hr prior to captan. Furthermore, usual increase in the activity of drug biotransformation enzymes seen after phenobarbital treatment appears to decrease in rats dosed with this fungicide. In vitro incubations of rat liver microsomes with captan resulted in a profound loss of cytochrome P-450 and the activity of benzphetamine N-demethylase as well as aniline hydroxylase. Although the inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzyme activity by captan was observed in microsomal incubations with or without NADPH, a detectable amount of carbonyl sulfide (COS) was found only in the incubations that contained captan plus NADPH. Carbonyl sulfide appears to arise from a captan-derived metabolite, thiophosgene (CSCl2), which decomposes to COS in aqueous solutions and in the presence of NADPH inhibits the activity of drug biotransformation enzymes."

The properties of CAP-MSNs-\u03b2-glucan were characterized using various techniques, including FTIR, \u03b6-potential, DLS, XRD, TGA, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM. The study evaluated the ability of CAP-MSNs-\u03b2-glucan to protect CAP from photolysis and hydrolysis compared to a commercial CAP formulation (CAP-CF). It also examined the distribution of CAP-MSNs-\u03b2-glucan in plant tissues, its bioactivity against Fusarium graminearum (a plant pathogen), and its toxicity to zebrafish (Danio rerio) compared to CAP-CF. Results showed that CAP-MSNs-\u03b2-glucan had high loading efficacy and could release up to 83.8% of the cargo after 20 days through enzymatic release. The nanovehicle demonstrated significant protection of CAP from UV degradation and pH changes. CAP-MSNs-\u03b2-glucan showed better distribution in corn tissues and higher inhibiting potency against Fusarium graminearum compared to CAP-CF. Additionally, it exhibited lower toxicity to zebrafish.
