    "Description": "Malachite green is an organic chloride salt that is the monochloride salt of malachite green cation. Used as a green-coloured dye, as a counter-stain in histology, and for its anti-fungal properties in aquaculture. It has a role as a fluorochrome, a histological dye, an antifungal drug, a carcinogenic agent, a teratogenic agent, an environmental contaminant and an antibacterial agent. It contains a malachite green cation.",

However, ready biodegradability tests, i.e. static flask screening test, Warburg respirometer, and a semicontinuous flow activated sludge system, using acclimated wastewater from a malachite green-producing workshop resulted in a removal rate of greater than 70%, indicating ready biodegradability(2). A Mycobacterium sp has been shown to decolorize a 20 mg/ml solution of malachite green 53% in 2 hrs at 24 \u00b0C; the solution was completed decolorized in 22 hrs when incubated at 32 \u00b0C(4). The pH remained at 6.8 and the number of cells did not increase(3)."

Western blots of MG /Malachite Green/ induced preneoplastic cells showed no phosphorylation of ERK1, an increased phosphoactive ERK2 associated with a decreased expression of phosphoactive JNK2. However, total forms of ERKs, JNKs and p38 Kinases showed similar levels of expression in control and preneoplastic SHE /Syrian hamster embryo/ cells. Indirect immunofluorescence studies have shown a distinct nuclear localisation of phosphoactive ERKs in MG induced preneoplastic cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed an increase of S-phase cells in preneoplastic cells compared to control SHE cells."

            "Value": "... In order to understand the mechanism(s) of tumor promotion by MY /Metanil yellow/ and MG /malachite green/, we have studied the levels of PCNA, a marker of cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1, and its associated kinase, cdk4, cyclin B1, and associated kinase, cdc2. Immunohistochemical staining showed an elevated level of PCNA in animals administered MY and MG subsequent to DEN /N-nitrosodiethylamine/  treatment. Western and Northern blot hybridization showed an increased expression of both cyclin D1 and its associated kinase cdk4, and cyclin B1 and its associated kinase cdc2, in livers of rats administered MY and MG after administration of DEN as compared to untreated or DEN controls. The increased level of mRNA was due to the increased rate of transcription of these genes as studied by run-on transcription assay."
