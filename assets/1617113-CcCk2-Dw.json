    "Description": "Quizalofop-P-ethyl is an ethyl 2-{4-[(6-chloroquinoxalin-2-yl)oxy]phenoxy}propanoate that has R configuration. A proherbicide for quizalofop-P, it is used to control annual and perennial grass weeds in a variety of crops, including potatoes, sugar beet, peanuts, cotton and flax. It has a role as a proherbicide and an agrochemical. It is an ethyl 2-{4-[(6-chloroquinoxalin-2-yl)oxy]phenoxy}propanoate and a quinoxaline herbicide. It is functionally related to a quizalofop-P. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-quizalofop-ethyl.",

            "content": "The study investigated the transgenerational effects of environmental stresses, specifically drought stress and herbicide treatment, on the response of Eragrostis plana Ness, an invasive perennial grass in South America, to the herbicide quizalofop-p-ethyl (QPE). The hypothesis was that priming by environmental stresses could lead to decreased sensitivity to herbicides in the progeny. The results showed that the population of E. plana exposed to drought stress (DRY) became less sensitive to quizalofop-p-ethyl treatment in the subsequent generation (G2). This reduced sensitivity was associated with changes in physiological and molecular mechanisms, including reduced stomatal conductance, increased hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation, and upregulated expression of certain genes involved in herbicide metabolism. These findings suggest a transgenerational adaptation of E. plana to abiotic stresses, with potential implications for weed management strategies.",
