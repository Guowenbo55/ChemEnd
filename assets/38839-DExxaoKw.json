Marked differences were observed in the rates and amounts of absorption and translocation between rice (tolerant) and barnyardgrass (susceptible) plants. When applied to the leaf surface, NK-049 readily penetrated the barnyardgrass leaf, while in rice, the absorption was slow. Translocation both upward and downward from the treated zone through leaf veins was slight in both plants. When applied to roots by dipping in NK-049 solution, barnyardgrass absorbed significantly more chemical compared to rice and readily translocated to aerial parts. When applied to intact seeds, NK-049 was absorbed more rapidly by barnyardgrass on a seed weight basis, while on a seed number basis, rice seeds absorbed more NK-049 than barnyardgrass seeds. Once absorbed by seeds, radioactivity was translocated to the first leaves in the seedlings of both rice and barnyardgrass, with a significantly greater amount in barnyardgrass than in rice. No appreciable difference was found in the metabolism of NK-049 between the two plants. The study suggested that the selective action of NK-049 is mainly influenced by differences in the rate and amount of absorption and translocation between rice and barnyardgrass. Carotenoid formation in barnyardgrass was strongly inhibited by NK-049, whereas that in rice was not affected, indicating a significant difference in the susceptibility of the carotenoid-biosynthesis systems of the two plants to NK-049, contributing to the selective herbicidal action of the chemical.",
