            "Value": "Iodofenphos applied at 0.3 mg/kg soil slightly stimulated the soil nitrifying activity while a 10 fold increase in the insecticide rate caused an inhibition of nitrification. The nitrification inhibition increased with further increase in iodofenphos rate to 6-7.5 mg/kg soil. The inhibition increased during the 1st 10 days of the insecticide application and then decreased but was still observed 30 days after iodofenphos treatment of the soil."

            "Value": "Biotransformation of a series of organophosphorus compounds by the 9,000 g supernatant of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver was tested in an in vitro system fortified either with NADPH-generating cofactors or with reduced glutathione. Elimination rate constants for both systems were calculated from linear decay curves when substrate concentrations were used that were considerably lower than the Km values of the concerned enzymatic reactions. The results reveal a large variation in both the oxidative and the glutathione-mediated biotransformation rate of the organophosphorus compounds. Half-lives ranged from 25 to 1,216 min in the NADPH system and from 18 to 381 min in the glutathione system. Elimination rate constants in the glutathione system were related to Hammett sigma constants or reactivity toward 4-nitrobenzylpyridine, which substantiates the assumption that electrophilicity is the controlling variable for the reaction with glutathione within this particular class of compounds. A remarkable analogy was observed between compounds that were metabolized relatively quickly by glutathione S-transferases and compounds that showed a reduced bioconcentration factor in guppies. A significant improvement of the relationship between the bioconcentration factor in guppies and the octanol/water partition coefficient was obtained when the rate constant with glutathione was introduced in this relationship. Such an improvement was not obtained with the rate constants from the oxidative system. These observations are discussed in view of the differences in the activities of the involved enzyme systems in the test species and in view of the possible relevance of the different biotransformation pathways for the in vivo situation."

Higher doses usually cause a fall in blood pressure, often as a consequence of effects of anticholinesterase agents on the medullary vasomotor centers of the CNS. /Anticholinesterase agents/"

            "Value": "Iodofenphos (CIBA C-9491) is a notable pesticide with systemic attributes that effectively manage ticks on livestock, control stable flies like Stomoxys calcitrans, and combat cattle grubs such as Hypoderma lineatum. In the context of its systemic nature, the research focused on determining residues and metabolites of iodofenphos. During analytical development, exposure of iodofenphos standard solutions in hexane to fluorescent light resulted in a peak shift on the gas chromatogram, indicating photodecomposition. Further investigation revealed that iodofenphos in hexane exposed to sunlight for 6-8 hours decomposed entirely into a product yielding a distinct peak. Similar photodecomposition occurred with the oxygen analogue in 8-10 hours of sunlight. Iodofenphos in carbon tetrachloride, when exposed to sunlight for 8-10 hours, also decomposed, producing a peak with the same retention time as ronnel, along with molecular iodine color formation. The photodecomposition products were identified as metabolites, sharing structural similarities with ronnel, differing only in the chlorine or iodine atom in the 4-ring position. The primary phenolic metabolites were identified as 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,5-dichloro-4-iodophenol, and it was concluded that these two phenols should be included in the analytical procedure to assess iodofenphos and its metabolites. This systemic aspect underscores the transformation of iodofenphos upon exposure to light and highlights the importance of understanding its degradation pathways for effective pesticide management."
