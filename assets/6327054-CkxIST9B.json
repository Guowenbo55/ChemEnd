The presence of 3 organotin fractions was shown; unchanged compound, dicyclohexyltin oxide, and monocyclohexylstannoic acid, and inorganic tin compounds, mainly stannic acid."

No attempt was made to determine the relative contributions to degradation from biodegradation, soil catalyzed degradation, and photolysis on the soil surface(1). No methylation of tricyclohexyltin hydroxide degradation products was observed in soils under aerobic or anaerobic conditions(2)."
