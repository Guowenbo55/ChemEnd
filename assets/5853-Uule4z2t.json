Persistence of trichlorfon in soils has been reported as 2 weeks or less and is degraded by ammonifying microorganisms(1). Trichlorfon degrades rapidly in aerobic soils with reported half-lives of approximately 1-27 days under non-sterile conditions(2). The biodegradation rate constant and half-life for trichlorfon was determined to be 0.28/day and 2.5 days, respectively, in an aerobic biodegradability test using an activated sludge inoculum incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 50 days(3). The decomposition rate of trichlorfon in river water at pH 7.39 was higher than in distilled water at pH 7.3-7.5 indicating that biodegradation aided in trichlorfon's decomposition in water(4)."

The toxicity of all four chemicals was significantly affected by pH in all tests, except for Gammarus exposed to terbufos. The toxicity of terbufos to rainbow trout and Gammarus was less at pH 7.5 than at higher or lower pH. The toxicity of both nitrophenols decreased as pH increased, whereas the toxicity of trichlorfon increased with pH. The effect of pH on trichlorfon toxicity decreased with temperature. Temperature significantly affected the toxicity of all four chemicals to both species. Toxicity increased with temperature in all tests, except for rainbow trout exposed to nitrophenols; toxicity decreased as temperature increased for rainbow trout. Chemical bioconcentration was also significantly affected by temperature and pH and was directly related to toxicity in most tests. Significant interactive effects between toxicity-modifying factors were also frequently observed. Temperature and pH effects on chemical toxicity need to be considered in chemical hazard assessment to ensure adequate protection of aquatic organisms."

In particular, in vitro studies in mouse oocytes showed the induction of aneuploidy and polyploidy at the first meiotic division and of severe morphological alterations of the second meiotic spindle. We have tested the hypothesis that an acute treatment of mice with TCF might similarly affect chromosome segregation in maturing oocytes. Superovulated MF-1 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 400 mg/kg TCF or orally administered with 600 mg/kg TCF either at the time of or 4 hr after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injection. Oocytes were harvested 17 hr after HCG and metaphase II chromosomes were cytogenetically analyzed. No significant increase of aneuploid or polyploid cells was detected at any treatment condition. A significant (p<0.001) decrease of metaphases showing premature chromatid separation or premature anaphase II in all TCF-treated groups with respect to controls suggested that TCF treatment may have delayed the first meiotic division. To evaluate possible effects of the pesticide upon the second meiotic division, a group of females orally treated with 600 mg/kg TCF at resumption of meiosis was mated with untreated males and zygotes were collected for cytogenetic analysis. No evidence of aneuploidy induction was obtained, but the frequency of polyploid zygotes was increased fivefold over the control level (p<0.01). Such polyploid embryos might have arisen from fertilization of oocytes that were either meiotically delayed and still in metaphase I at fertilization or progressed through anaphase II without cytokinesis. These findings show that in vivo studies on aneuploidy induction in oocytes may yield results different from those obtained by in vitro experiments and that both kinds of data may be necessary for risk assessment of environmentally relevant exposures."

To explore dose-response and direct and indirect, potentially synergistic effects of TCF on the somatic cells and the oocyte within a follicle, we presently employed preantral follicle culture. 100 ug/mL TCF added at the time of hormonally stimulated resumption of meiosis of follicle cell-enclosed mouse oocytes, 16 hr before in vitro ovulation, induced significant rises in first meiotic nondisjunction in oocytes from preantral follicle culture. Lower concentrations (6 ug/mL TCF) disturbed polar body formation. Nuclear maturation to meiosis II in absence of cytokinesis resulted in significant increases in polyploidy. Oocytes maturing in follicles in the presence of TCF had aberrant second meiotic spindles. Influences of TCF on somatic cell function were evident by reduced follicular mucification in vitro and deceased progesterone production. In contrast to TCF, acetylcholine (0.1-100 uM) increased progesterone production. The observations therefore suggest that TCF influences oocyte maturation and folliculogenesis directly and indirectly. High TCF is aneugenic at first meiotic division in oocytes, irrespective of the presence or absence of follicle cells. At lower concentrations TCF interferes with spindle formation, chromosome congression at meiosis II, and coordination of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, posing risks for second meiotic errors. The observations suggest that chronic TCF exposure during maturation in the follicle may predispose oocytes to the formation of chromosomally unbalanced preimplantation embryos after fertilization."

After the various concentrations of trichlorfon treatment (0, 0.04, 0.2, 1, 5 or 25 umol/L) for 24 hr, the progesterone production presented a dose-dependent decrease in the presence of some stimulators such as human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), cholera toxin (CT) or forskolin. However, the levels of intracellular cAMP remained unaltered, which suggested that trichlorfon suppressed steroidogenesis occurred after PKA activation along cAMP/PKA pathway. Moreover, trichlorfon suppressed the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mRNA and protein, and also profoundly inhibited the activity of P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), rather than 3beta-hydorxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). The suppressive expression of P450scc mRNA and protein further accounted for the inhibitory action of trichlorfon on steroidogenesis.

Metabolic activity, intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured to examine the impact of metrifonate on viability and integrity of cultured rat cortical astrocytes. The influence of metrifonate, acetylcholine and selective cholinergic ligands on nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) synthesis and secretion was determined by specific two-site enzyme immunoassays. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to metrifonate displayed no toxic effects on cell viability. Metrifonate and acetylcholine potently and transiently elevated NGF and BDNF, but not NT-3, protein levels and secretion with different intensity and time frame of their maximal response. Stimulatory effect on NGF was mimicked by selective nicotinic receptor agonist nicotine and completely blocked by nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine.

TCF stimulated maturation to meiosis II at 50 microg/ml, but arrested meiosis in some oocytes at 100 ug/mL. TCF at 100 ug/mL was aneugenic causing non-disjunction of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I, a significant increase of the hyperploidy rate at metaphase II, and a significant rise in the numbers of oocytes that contained a 'diploid' set of metaphase II chromosomes (dyads). TCF elevated the rate of precocious chromatid segregation (predivision) at 50 and 100 ug/mL. Pulse-chase experiments with 100 ug/mL TCF present during the first 7 hr or the last 9 hr of maturation in vitro did not affect meiotic progression and induced intermediate levels of hyperploidy at metaphase II. Exposure to > or =50 ug/mL TCF throughout maturation in vitro induced severe spindle aberrations at metaphase II, and over one-third of the oocytes failed to align all chromosomes at the spindle equator (congression failure). These observations suggest that exposure to high concentrations of TCF induces non-disjunction at meiosis I of oogenesis, while lower doses may preferentially cause errors in chromosome segregation at meiosis II due to disturbances in spindle function, and chromosome congression as well as precocious separation of chromatids prior to anaphase II. The data support evidence from other studies that TCF has to be regarded as a germ cell aneugen."

By causing spindle aberrations and influencing chromosome congression, trichlorfon appears, therefore, to predispose mammalian oocytes to random chromosome segregation, especially when they undergo a first division and develop to metaphase II during exposure."

According to a classification scheme(7), these Koc values suggests that trichlorfon is expected to have high to very high mobility in soil(SRC). In lysimeter studies designed to simulate golf course fairways and greens, trichlorfon was found to migrate quickly and was detected in the leachate after the first watering event(8)."

            "Value": "In this study, the available phosphorus (AP) and TCF concentrations in soils and maize (Zea mays) seedling tissues were measured in response to escalating TCF concentrations during 216 hr of culture. Maize seedlings growth considerably enhanced soil TCF degradation, reaching the highest of 73.2% and 87.4% at 216 hr in 50 and 200 mg/kg TCF treatments, respectively, and increased AP contents in all the seedling tissues. Soil TCF was majorly accumulated in seedling roots, reaching maximum concentration of 0.017 and 0.076 mg/kg in TCF-50 and TCF-200, respectively. The hydrophilicity of TCF might hinder its translocation to the aboveground shoot and leaf. Using bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that TCF addition drastically lessened bacterial community interactions and hindered the complexity of their biotic networks in rhizosphere than in bulk soils, leading to the homogeneity of bacterial communities that were resistant or prone to TCF biodegradation. Mantel test and redundancy analysis suggested a significant enrichment of dominant species Massilia belonging to Proteobacteria phyla, which in turn affecting TCF translocation and accumulation in maize seedling tissues. This study provided new insight into the biogeochemical fate of TCF in maize seedling and the responsible rhizobacterial community in soil TCF absorption and translocation."
