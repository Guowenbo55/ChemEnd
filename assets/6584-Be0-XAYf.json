    "Description": "Methyl acetate is an acetate ester resulting from the formal condensation of acetic acid with methanol. A low-boiling (57 ??) colourless, flammable liquid, it is used as a solvent for many resins and oils. It has a role as a polar aprotic solvent, a fragrance and an EC 3.4.19.3 (pyroglutamyl-peptidase I) inhibitor. It is an acetate ester, a methyl ester and a volatile organic compound.",
