            "Value": "Difenacoum was not detected in tissue samples of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) collected from the upper Loire River (France) region between 2004-2008(1). Difenacoum was detected, at concentrations of 0.08 ug/g or higher, in liver tissue from bird species (common buzzard, barn owl) collected from Loire Atlantique France in 2003(2). Difenacoum was detected in a liver sample from one great horn owl (Bubo virginianus) collected during a monitoring study between June 2008 and Feb 2010 in the New Jersey area(3). Difenacoum, brodifacoum, bromadiolone and flocoumafen were detected in golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and eagle owl (Bubo bubo) livers at a total concentration of between 11 and 255 ng/g in approximately 70% of the golden eagles and 50% of the eagle owls examined in a Norwegian study between 2009 and 2011(4). Difenacoum was detected in British tawny owl (Strix aluco) livers at a geometric mean concentration of 0.03 ug/g(5). In British polecat (Mustela putorius) livers, difenacoum was detected at concentrations of 0.1-0.35 ug/g(6). Liver tissue from eagle owls collected in Sweden contained difenacoum levels of 15 ng/g while muscle tissue contained levels ranging from <1 ng/g (the detection limit) to 1.8 ng/g(7)."
