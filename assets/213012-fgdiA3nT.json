            "content": "Aminopyralid is a new auxinic herbicide that provides Canada thistle control at lower use rates than clopyralid. Studies were conducted to determine if differences in absorption, translocation, or metabolism account for aminopyralid\u2019s greater biological activity. Radiolabeled aminopyralid and clopyralid were applied to individual leaves of rosette-stage Canada thistle plants. Nonionic surfactant was used for the absorption studies because it provided higher aminopyralid absorption than methylated seed oil or crop oil concentrate. Clopyralid was absorbed very rapidly, reaching 72% 24 h after treatment (HAT) and remaining near or above 80% during a 192-h time course. During the same time period, aminopyralid absorption increased from 34 to 60%. Clopyralid translocation out of the treated leaf was significantly higher than aminopyralid, 39% compared with 17%, respectively, 192 HAT. More of applied clopyralid translocated to aboveground tissue 192 HAT (27%) than to roots (12%), whereas aminopyralid translocation was similar in aboveground tissue (10%) and roots (7%) 192 HAT. Neither aminopyralid nor clopyralid was metabolized 192 HAT. Although aminopyralid is effective at lower use rates than clopyralid, clopyralid absorption and translocation were higher in Canada thistle. These results suggest that aminopyralid\u2019s chemical structure may provide for greater biological activity at the target site than clopyralid.",

Differential efficacy between fall and spring applications suggests vernalization impacts herbicide absorption and translocation in other perennial asters. Clopyralid and aminopyralid absorption and translocation were quantified in non-vernalized and vernalized plants following application of 14C labeled herbicides 2, 4, 8, 24, and 72 h after treatment. Less 14C clopyralid was absorbed, and at a slower rate, in vernalized plants. Movement out of the treated leaf was slower, with 14C clopyralid translocating more rapidly than 14C aminopyralid. More 14C moved to the roots in non-vernalized plants compared to vernalized plants, regardless of herbicide. Increased translocation to belowground survival structures is needed for effective control of C. juncea.",
