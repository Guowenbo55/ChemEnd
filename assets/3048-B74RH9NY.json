            "Value": "AEROBIC: Endrin appears to be resistant to biodegradation in natural waters and most soils. Greater than 80% of endrin was recovered from sterilized and unsterilized natural water (drainage canal of Holland Marsh, Ontario, Canada) and distilled water after 16 weeks(1). No degradation of endrin observed - Little Miami River water, 8 weeks(2). Soil biodegradation half-lives of approximately 4 to 8 years(3) and 14 yrs(4) or more(5) have been reported. Considerable degradation (51% - 4 days in Rutledge sand to essentially 100% in Magnolia sandy loam) has been reported(6); however, biodegradation was not conclusively proven to be the degradation route nor were the products identified(6). After 2 months endrin recovery in flooded (anaerobic) Casiguran soil was only 8.4% while 88.24% was recovered in the upland (aerobic) soil(7); endrin persisted in all other soils for 2 months(7). Endrin, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0 percent of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(10). The half-life for endrin in soil under aerobic conditions was reported as 4,300 days(11). ANAEROBIC: Anaerobic conditions apparently stimulate biodegradation of endrin, although it remains persistent(8). The half-life in thick anaerobic sewage sludge is 5-14 days with 4 unidentified products observed(9)."

Twenty grams of dorsal fish muscle were extracted and the residues analyzed by GLC; reagent blanks and spike samples were included with each sample. The waters from which the fish were obtained receive drainage from industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Water samples were not assayed for specific components.

The percutaneous LD50 for 10 month old mallard drakes (n =2) after a 24 hr dermal foot exposure to the 97% sample aoppears to be >140 mg/kg. Signs observed after percutaneous treatment included hyperexcitability, tenseness, shakiness, jerkiness, ataxia goose-stepping ataxia, slowness, and stumbling. These signs appeared as soon as 3 hr after the initiation of treatment. Remission took up to 4 days after the end of treatment. Mild dermal irritation was caused by exposure to endrin. When the percutaneous LD50 is compared with the acute oral LD50, endrin appears to have a relatively low order of dermal hazard in mallards."

In fact reproduction may continue with little change even at dosage levels that produce some convulsions. The results in wild deer mice are similar. Increased fetal mortality and also increased fetal toxicity (primarily delayed and deviant ossification) /was reported/ in the offspring of rats and mice that were bred for the first time 1 week after receiving four oral doses of endrin emulsion at a rate of 0.58 mg/kg at weekly intervals. The small differences were of unstated statistical significance. Endrin administered pregnancy at half the LD50 level produced a marked increase in fetal deaths of hamsters but not mice. Open eye, webbed foot, cleft palate, and especially fused ribs were seen in young hamster and may have been related to growth retardation."

High levels also were found in the offspring of resistant mice, suggesting that the difference may be inherited. The evidence for inheritance (in contrast to tolerance) is reasonable inasmuch as endrin is excreted rapidly, but final proof would require, among other things, demonstration that the young received no endrin via the placenta and milk. In nature, where the possibilty of outbreeding cannot be excluded, pine mice gradually lost resistance to endrin after application of endrin as a control measure was stopped."

The LD50 of 12-ketoendrin is 1.1 and 0.8 mg/kg in male and female rats respectively, and it exerts its full effect during the first 20 hr, compared to 4 to 8 days for endrin. Thus, 12-ketoendrin may be responsible for much of the acute toxicity of endrin or of intermediate metabolites in the rat. However, the fact that the brains of rats killed by endrin contain (in addition to endrin) substantially less 12-ketoendrin than do the brains of rats killed by 12-ketoendrin suggests that endrin is toxic per se."

A single foliar spray of endrin emulsion at low dosages (90 g of active ingredient per hectare) on 8- to 11-day-old summer plants was effective in protecting the plants from damage for about 15 days. The persistent effect of endrin was attributed to the kill of newly hatched larvae by the toxicant translocated from the initial deposit into the post-treatment growth of the plants. Endrin also exhibited some repellent action against ovipositing flies.
