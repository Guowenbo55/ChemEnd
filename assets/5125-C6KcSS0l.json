The study did not determine whether the observed degradation of tribufos was due to abiotic processes (such as photolysis or hydrolysis) or biological processes(1). Residues of tribufos contained in cotton gin wastes were stable to composting under anaerobic and aerobic conditions(2). The amount of tribufos recovered from an untreated seawater/sediment mixture after 5 days was 20% versus a 77% recovery after 7 days from mixtures that were sterilized with formalin; no volatilization losses were observed in experiments with sediment present(3). A 50% loss was observed in untreated seawater without sediment after accounting for volatilization losses, but no sterilized control experiments were run in seawater alone(3). Some of the losses observed in these experiments may have been due to abiotic hydrolysis(3)."

Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly inhibited 28 days after treatment among hens receiving S,S,S-tri-n-butyl-phosphorotrithioate in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg/kg, as well as among tri-o-cresyl-phosphate and parathion treated animals. Brain acid phosphatase and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase activity values were significantly higher in all treated animals as compared to controls. Single dermal doses of S,S,S-tri-n-butyl-phosphorotrithioate and tri-o-cresyl-phosphate also caused an initial decrease in plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity. Hens receiving S,S,S-tri-n-butyl-phosphorotrithioate in single dermal doses of 250 to 1,000 mg/kg developed ataxia, which progressed into paralysis in some animals. Histopathological examinations revealed axon and myelin degeneration of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in certain animals. The severity and frequency of the neuropathological lesions observed were found to be dose dependent. The neurological dysfunctions and neuropathological lesions noted among S,S,S-tri-n-butyl-phosphorotrithioate treated hens were similar to those exhibited by tri-o-cresyl-phosphate treated controls. Parathion produced acute cholinergic effects, but did not cause delayed neurotoxicity. /It was/ concluded that S,S,S-tri-n-butyl-phosphorotrithioate is capable of producing delayed neurotoxicity among hens in a single dermal doses of 250 to 1,000 mg/kg."

O,O-Diethyl-O-(4-nitrophenyl) phosphorothioate (parathion) and tri-o-cresyl phosphate were used as negative and positive controls for organophosphorus induced delayed neurotoxicity. Brain acetylcholinesterase was significantly inhibited with topical doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg of DEF and with orally and dermally applied parathion. Plasma cholinesterase and liver microsomal carboxylesterase activities were significantly reduced from control in all treatment groups. Neurotoxic esterase was significantly decreased from control with topical dosing of 200, 500, and 1000 mg/kg DEF and with tri-o-cresyl phosphate treatments. Oral doses of DEF increased cytochrome p450 content by 70 to 200% while dermal application caused a 200 to 325% increase over control. p-Chloro-N-methylaniline demethylase was also increased by treatments but to a lesser extent than that of aniline hydroxylase or cytochrome p450 content. Tri-o-cresyl phosphate and parathion had no significant effect on liver microsomal oxidative enzymes. Liver microsomal proteins from hens treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, or DEF were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A striking increase in a 49K protein band in microsomes from phenobarbital and DEF (616 and 338%, respectively) treated hens was seen, while the 55K protein band showed an 861% increase in microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated hens. In conclusion, dermally applied DEF was more effective in inhibiting esterases and inducing cytochrome p450 than orally administered DEF; toxicity was directly related to the dose and route of administration."

Clinical observations included: (1) acute toxicity (typical of ChE inhibition, and responsive to atropine treatment), (2) a \"late effect\", which begins within 2 days of treatment and which may continue with progressive neurological effects leading to death, all in the absence of neurohistopathological signs, and (3) TOCP-like delayed neurotoxicity with associated microscopic lesions. Neurohistopathological changes comparable to TOCP effects were seen only at 1000 mg/kg (highest dose tested (HDT)) dermal dose of DEF; oral dosing of DEF did not lead to neurohistopathological changes.
