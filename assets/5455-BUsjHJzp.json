    "Description": "Thiram is an organic disulfide that results from the formal oxidative dimerisation of N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamic acid. It is widely used as a fungicidal seed treatment. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an antiseptic drug and an antifungal agrochemical. It contains a dimethyldithiocarbamate. It is functionally related to a dimethyldithiocarbamic acid.",

Thiram, at 100 ppm, inoculated with 30 ppm activated sludge at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7.0 was less than 30% degraded after two weeks(2,3). Thiram has been reported to degrade more rapidly in unsterilized soil than in sterilized soil; however, degradation rates were not specified(4,5). Thiram, at 300 ppm, was 20% and 25% degraded after 24 days in autoclaved and non-autoclaved alluvial sandy loam (pH 7.3), respectively(6). Copper dimethyldithiocarbamate, dithiocarbamate, dimethylamine, and carbon disulfide are major metabolites in soil(5,7,8). Other metabolites include elemental sulfur, methionine, formaldehyde, dimethyldithiocarbamate-alpha-aminobutyric acid, and the corresponding keto-acid(2).

In addition, incorporation of (14)C-activity from glucose, glycerol, and palmitic acid into phospholipids (pls) decreased in most of the components, showing a compensatory increase in only a few of them. Fatty acid (fa) concentrations in phosphatidylcholine (pc) or phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) molecules were increased or decreased from one fatty acid class to the other. This alteration of the fatty acid concentrations in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively, was virtually exclusively in position 2 of the two pl molecules. The total content of saturated fats in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine was significantly decrease only after 1 g/kg thiram; this was assoc with an increase in total unsaturated fas. The multiple changes in the bioformation and composition of microsomal membrane pls suggest a disturbance of the monooxygenase system. It is conceivable that there is an interrelationship between the observed impairment and the inhibitory effect of thiram on the microsomal monooxygenase (mms)."

In addition, thiram exerted a significant lethal effect on implants, relative to controls. The number of preimplantation losses increased from 0.2 per female among controls to 0.69 per female among exposed mice. The number of dead implants increased from 0.4 per female among controls to 1.75 per female among exposed mice."

In parallel with malondialdehyde formation inhibition, oxidative destruction of microsomal cytochrome P450 was delayed with increasing thiram concentrations. As thiram inhibited lipid peroxidation both in heat-denatured and freshly prepared microsomes, it can be deduced that the dithiocarbamates intervene in a non-enzymatic oxidation phase of the lipid peroxidation."

Researchers optimized an LC-MS/MS method for analyzing thiram residues in vegetables (eggplant, lettuce) and fruits (strawberry). Careful steps were taken to minimize thiram degradation during storage and preparation, including using low temperature, adding sodium sulfate anhydride as a dehydrating agent, adding sodium bicarbonate to regulate pH, and adding EDTA to reduce enzymatic activity. The optimized procedure achieved good recoveries (80-106%) and relative standard deviations (<10%) at 0.1 and 0.01 mg/kg fortification levels (n=5) in eggplant, lettuce, and strawberry. Detection limits below 0.0012 mg/kg were obtained. This validated methodology minimized degradation of the non-systemic fungicide thiram, allowing effective residue detection in produce samples using LC-MS/MS."
