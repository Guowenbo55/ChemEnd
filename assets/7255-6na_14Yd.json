    "Description": "3-chloro-p-toluidine is a monochloroaniline that is p-toluidine in which one of the hydrogens that is meta to the amino group is replaced by a chlorine. It has a role as an avicide. It is a chloroaniline and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is functionally related to a p-toluidine.",

            "Value": "Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were continuously exposed to 0.1 um/mL of uniformly -labled 3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride for 28 days, followed by 28 days depuration. Concentrations in the edible, nonedible, and whole-body tissues were 2.9, 12.0, and 7.5 ug/g tissue, respectively. BCF values of 33, 150, and 88, respectively, were calculated. About 64% of the accumulated radiolabeled compound and metabolites were eliminated from the fish by day 28 of depuration. The authors conclude that bioconcentration will be low at sublethal concentrations(1). A log BCF of 1.9445 was reported, corresponding to a BCF of 88(SRC), in bluegill sunfish exposed to 3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride for 28 days in accordance with EPA guideline 165.4 - Laboratory Studies of Pesticide Accumulation in Fish(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration of 3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). /3-Chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride/"

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of 3-chloro-p-toluidine can be estimated to be 180(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3-chloro-p-toluidine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, primary aromatic amines can react with humic matter in soil forming an irreversible complex and as a result may be immobilized in soil(3-4). With the increase of humic matter in soil, the tendency towards irreversible complex formation may increase and 3-chloro-p-toluidine may become increasingly immobilized(4). In sandy soil containing marginal amounts of humic matter, 3-chloro-p-toluidine may be mobile(5)."
