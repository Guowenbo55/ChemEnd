            "Value": "AEROBIC: The primary mode of biodegradation for propoxur appears to be hydrolysis of the carbamate linkage(1). The biodegradation of propoxur under aerobic conditions in silt loam and sandy loam soils followed first order kinetics for the first 112 and 180 days, respectively(1). The half-life values were 80 days for the silt loam and 210 days for the sandy loam(1). Propoxur was the major extractable residue found in the studies(1). One day after propoxur was applied to a sandy loam soil with no history of insecticidal treatment, 94% remained(2). However, when soil was previously treated four times with carbofuran (a methylcarbamate), only 20% of the propoxur remained after 1 day; this shows that acclimation markedly affects the rate of biodegradation of propoxur in soil(2). In another laboratory study, the biodegradation half-life of propoxur in Montardon soil, not previously treated with carbofuran, was 146 days, while in previously treated soil, the half-life was 9.3 days(3). Propoxur is reported to biodegrade quite rapidly in water, particularly when the bacterial activity and temperature are high(4). In a biodegradation test which used a combination of activated sludge, silt loam soil, and sediment as an inoculum, the half-life of propoxur was 44 days under aerobic conditions(5). When glucose and peptone was added as a source of carbon and energy, the half-life decreased to 19 days under aerobic conditions(5). Using a mixture of non-acclimated sludge, field soil, and river sediment as inoculum, the aerobic biodegradation half-life was 0.6 day at an initial concentration of 2 ppm at 18-22 \u00b0C(6)."

Propoxur or a metabolite was postulated to operate on or with growth factors to elicit hyperplasia and eventual tumor development. Since some propoxur metabolites are phenols, and since some phenols share with propoxur the property of being urinary bladder oncogens only at extremely high dose levels, threshold effects may be present. Low urinary pH was noted to inhibit binding of epidermal growth factor, which is abundant in rat urine. This is consistent with rat studies, in which pH reduction markedly reduced the extent of hyperplasia. Perspectives offered in this discussion suggest that propoxur-induced tumors in rats may not be relevant to man, but the \"possible adverse effect\" designation remains until more definitive evidence can be obtained."

In both sexes at 5000 ppm there were increases in incidence and degree of what was described as slight peripheral neuropathy (mainly characterized by myelin alterations, such as vacuolization, myelinovoid formation, and occasional phagocytes). Additionally, there was an increased incidence of slight muscular atrophy of the rear extremities. At 1000 and 5000 ppm there were significant increases in hyperplasia of the urinary bladder in both sexes (males: 1/50, 1/50, 10/50 and 44/100 for the 0, 200, 1000 and 5000 ppm groups; females: 0/50, 0/50, 5/50, 4/48).

Nominal exposure levels were 0 (vehicle: a 1:1 mixture of propylene glycol and ethanol), 2, 10, or 50 mg propoxur/cu m. Corresponding analytical concentrations were 0, 2.2, 10.4, or 50.5 mg/cu m. There were frequent occurrences of significant cholinesterase inhibition (plasma, RBC and brain) at 10 and 50 mg/cu m. Statistically significant RBC cholinesterase depressions at 2 mg/cu m at weeks 25-26 and 51 were not part of dose-related trends and/or were probably within the limits of normal variation.

The high dose dogs received 1800 ppm during weeks 1-40, 3600 ppm for weeks 41-44, and 5400 ppm for weeks 45-52. The mean quantities of propoxur consumed per animal were 0, 62.4, 186.3, or 780.7 mg/day; or values about 0, 6.77, 22.0, or 98.2 mg/kg/day. At the highest dose level, one male died at week 50. After week 20, highest-dose dogs of both sexes had lower mean body weights than their corresponding controls; at week 41 and thereafter their weights were significantly lower. At week 41 three dogs in the high-dose group showed an increased incidence of vomiting (after the level of propoxur was raised from 1800 to 3600 ppm). One high-dose female had poor weight gain in the first 40 weeks, and appeared emaciated at the end of the study. This dog was one of those vomiting more frequently after week 41, and had gone from 6.6 kg at week 40 to 6.0 kg at week 52. After the level was raised to 5400 ppm, almost all of the high-dose dogs had an increased incidence of vomiting; some also showed more frequent salivation. Most also had spasms throughout their entire bodies after feeding, while two \"exhibited an uncertain gait with slightly bent joints.\" One dog \"temporarily showed aggressive behavior\" and another \"exhibited circular movements.\" Mean thrombocyte counts were consistently (and significantly) elevated in high-dose dogs, and there was an additional increase in this parameter after week 40 (when the propoxur concentration was increased). Mean cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in mid- and high-dose dogs from week 6; mean cholesterol levels were consistently elevated, sometimes significantly so, (relative to control values) in 200 ppm dogs from week 6 to termination. At termination, mean N-demethylase activity was significantly elevated in mid and high-dose dogs; cytochrome P450 was elevated (but not significantly) in high-dose dogs only. Plasma cholinesterase activities tended to be lower in high-dose dogs relative to control values, and RBC ChE activities tended to be lower (relative to controls) in dogs receiving 1800 ppm one hour after feeding. Mean liver weights and mean thyroid weights were elevated at termination in the high-dose dogs, and the organ-to-body weight ratios were significantly elevated. However, the high mean thyroid weights were due to findings from only two of the high-dose dogs, one of which had a thyroid cyst; without these dogs the mean thyroid weight from high-dose dogs was comparable to that of controls (high-dose dogs: 0.892 g; controls: 0.928 g). Mean kidney and mean adrenal weights were somewhat elevated in the high-dose dogs. Mean thymus weights in high-dose dogs were significantly lower (4.07 g vs a control value of 0.869) and the thymus-to-body weight ratio was significantly lower in high-dose dogs (0.479 g/kg vs 0.872 g/kg). Since the low-dose dogs showed an elevated mean cholesterol level which was part of a well-defined dose trend, a NOEL was not observed in the original one yr study. Subsequently, in a bridging study, groups of 4 male and 4 female beagle dogs were fed diets containing 0 or 70 ppm propoxur for 6 months (males: 0 or 2.46 mg/kg/day; females: 0 or 2.71 mg/kg/day). In this 6 month study, there was no indication of any effect (including an elevation of cholesterol levels) on animals receiving the diet containing 70 ppm propoxur. This establishes a NOEL in the dog of 2.46 mg/kg/day."

The NOEL was changed to 50 ppm /based on mild simple hyperplasia and on a single case of papillary hyperplasia./ Papillomas were observed at 3000 ppm at 2 year term of study, in association with greater degree and earlier onset of hyperplasia. Trends continued in 5000 and 8000 ppm groups, with papillomas and carcinomas. Tumors were observed as early as 78 weeks in the 8000 ppm group.

These exposure levels were equivalent to 0, 33, 132. or 543 mg/kg/day of for males, and 0, 39, 163, or 703 mg/kg/day for females. Additional groups of 12 male and 12 female rats were fed diets containing 0 or 8000 ppm propoxur for 13 weeks, followed by a 4 week recovery period. There were Functional Observation Battery (FOB) and Motor and Locomotor observations at pretreatment and weeks 4, 8, and 13. Epileptoid seizures were observed in 5/24 8000 ppm females during FOB testing. It is hypothesized that these were due to acetylcholine accumulation in the brain and a genetic disposition of these rats. In males, 1/12 at the 2000 ppm (but 0/24 at 8000 ppm) showed epileptoid seizures during FOB testing; this one occurrence was not considered to be related to treatment. Slightly decreased grip strength and foot splay in males and females at 2000 and 8000 were considered to correlate with body weight retardation at these dietary exposure levels. Motor and locomotor activity were not affected in males of any dose level or in females exposed to 500 or 2000 ppm; activity was extremely low in individual females at 8000 ppm that had epileptoid seizures during FOB testing which was immediately prior to motor and locomotor activity measurements. There were no other indications of neurological effects observed in testing. Week 13 ophthalmic examination showed a reduced pupillary reflex in 4/24 males and 2/24 females exposed to 8000 ppm, presumably due to cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to mean brain weights. There were no significant differences between controls and 8000 ppm rats (6/sex/group examined) with respect to microscopic neurology findings. At week 13, 2000 ppm and 8000 ppm males had significantly lower mean body weights (-12% and -21% respectively); as did 2000 and 8000 ppm females (-7% and -20%) than controls. Plasma and Red Blood Cell (RBC) cholinesterase measurements were taken from 6/sex/group of the non-recovery rats at weeks 4 and 14, and brain ChE was measured at week 14. For males, RBC ChE was significantly reduced at 2000 and 8000 ppm for week 4, and at 8000 ppm for week 14. For females, plasma ChE was significantly reduced at 8000 ppm for week 4. Brain ChE was significantly reduced at week 14 in 2000 and 8000 ppm males and females (2000 ppm: males: -24%; females: - 18%; 8000 ppm: males: -28%; females: -19%), and \"marginally\" (but with p </= 0.01) in 500 ppm males (-14%). Cholinesterase inhibition associated with exposure to carbamates is reversible, and so these measured cholinesterase activities may not fully indicate the maximum levels of inhibition that occurred, as presumably some time elapsed between blood or brain collection and measurement of ChE activities. The NOEL for FOB and motor and locomotor activity changes is 163 mg/kg/day for females, with a LOEL of 703 mg/kg/day; the NOEL in males is 543 mg/kg/day (HDT). The NOEL for ophthalmic changes is 132 mg/kg/day for males and 164 mg/kg/day for females, with a LOEL (reduced pupillary reflex in some rats) of 543 mg/kg/day for males and 703 mg/kg/day for females. The NOEL for reduced ChE in females was 39 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 163 mg/kg/day (reduced brain ChE activity, with reduced plasma ChE at 703 mg/kg/day); for males the NOEL was below 33 mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested); the LOEL was 33 mg/kg/day (reduced brain ChE activity at all dietary exposure levels; reduced RBC ChE at 132 and 543 ppm). There were no indications of any dose-related microscopic effects in skeletal muscle tissues or neural tissues; the NOEL for microscopic lesions (and histoneurological effects) is 543 mg/kg/day for males and 703 mg/kg/day for females. This was the highest dose tested. This study satisfies the guideline requirement (82-7) for a subchronic neurotoxicity screening study in rats."

In general, motor activity was a sensitive measure of ChE inhibition for all these carbamate pesticides, and vertical activity showed the greatest magnitude of effect at the highest doses compared to either horizontal activity or ChE inhibition. Brain and RBC ChE activities were generally affected similarly. Pearson correlation coefficients of within-subject data showed good correlation between the behavioral and biochemical end points, with brain ChE inhibition and horizontal activity showing the highest correlation values. Determination of benchmark dose levels for 10% change in each end point also revealed that these two measures produced the lowest estimates.

Maximum inhibition of blood cholinesterase was observed within 30 min after administration of propoxur. The half-life of enzyme-activity recovery was estimated to be 208.6 min. Peak brain cholinesterase inhibition was also detected between 5 and 30 min of the pesticide administration, but the half-life for enzyme activity recovery was much shorter, in the range of 85 min. Within this same time interval of the enzyme effects, diminished motor and exploratory activities and decreased performance of animals in the active avoidance task were observed. Likewise, behavioral normalization after propoxur followed a time frame similar to that of brain cholinesterase. These data indicate that behavioral changes that occur during intoxication with low oral doses of propoxur may be dissociated from signs characteristic of cholinergic over-stimulation but accompany brain cholinesterase activity inhibition."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Modulations in ionic composition were seen in the rat brain during propoxur treatment indicating an impairment in the electric activity of neurons, oxygen consumption, ATPase system, disruption in the movement of ions across inonic pumps and synaptic transmission. The specific activity levels of ATPase were also altered confirming that the impairment in the ATPase system might be due to the ionic imbalances under propoxur stress."

            "Value": "The Koc of propoxur ranges from <1 to 103(1,2). In batch equilibrium studies, propoxur was very mobile, with Koc values of 3.4, 11.2, and 102.6 for sandy loam, silt loam, and silty clay soils, respectively(2). In other studies, Koc values ranged from 28-68, and for silt loam, sandy loam, sand, and clay loam soils, the Koc values were 39 (Kd = 0.597, 2.9 %OM, pH 5.9), 0.76 (Kd = 0.004, 1.1 %OM, pH 6.6), 34 (Kd = 0.181, 1.0 %OM, pH 4.3), and 28 (Kd = 0.329, 2.2 %OM, pH 6.4), respectively(1). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that propoxur has very high to high mobility in soil(SRC). In soil thin-layer mobility studies on six soils, propoxur was found to be mobile, with Rf values of 0.70 to 0.89(2)."
