            "Value": "At an initial concentration of 0.8 and 0.08 mg/l, quinoline had a BCF ranging from <0.1-2.5 and <1.0-3.8, respectively, in orange red killifish(1). Rainbow trout swimup fry, ranging from 0.21-0.41 g in size, were exposed to quinoline at 1 mg/l for 48 hours and analyzed for bioconcentration(2). Whole body levels of quinoline increased rapidly during the first 4 hours of exposure and reached an apparent plateau after about 24 hours. Quinoline had a calculated bioconcentration factor of 3.73. After 48 hours, the fish were placed in non-quinoline contaminated water for 24 hours and monitored for depuration(2). Less than 2% of unmetabolized quinoline remained after the 24-hour depuration period. Metabolites found within fish tissues included hydroxyquinolines and quinolinethiols(2). In a static exposure study using fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 8 was measured(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Quinoline, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0.2% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(1). Under aerobic conditions, quinoline, present at 1 mg/l, reached 90 percent degradation in 310 hours after exposure to groundwater from a gasoline contaminated aquifer(2). The biodegradability of quinoline at various concentrations was determined using a river water die-away test and water collected from the Green River (Newton, KY)(3). The kinetics of removal of quinoline from solution was dependent on the initial concentration. The lowest quinoline concentration (0.1 mg/l) differed from the others in that it exhibited a longer lag period than did the three progressively higher concentrations. In general, the half-lives for the degradation of quinoline ranged from 2.25-5.25 days at initial concentrations ranging from 0.1-150 mg/l(3). The highest half-life of 5.25 days occurred at an initial concentration of 150 mg/l. The presence of quinolinone in the outermost groundwater samples collected on day 471 has been attributed to its being an aerobic biodegradation product of quinoline which was added as a component of coal tar creosote to a natural sand aquifer in Borden, Ontario, Canada as part of a field study(4). Quinoline at a concn of 6 ng/g was completed removed by activated sludge and a dissolved air flotation treatment system with similar results reported using a pilot-scale mixed-media filter system and activated carbon columns(5). Quinoline was degraded in a Danish sandy soil from Lundgaard, Jutland, characterized by 2.47% organic carbon content, 80.2% sand, 13.2% silt, 4.8% clay, and a pH of 5.8; using batch experiments at pH 5.8 and 7 with concns of 10 and 50 mg/kg quinoline, 14CO2 production was 21%/day after 3-4 days in all experiments(6). Microbial utilization was found to be desorption-rate limiting(7)."

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: Primary digesting sludge was collected from a sewage treatment plant and used to determine the potential for anaerobic biodegradation of quinoline(1). Within four weeks, quinoline was completely degraded while being incubated at 35 \u00b0C. Quinolinone has been identified as an anaerobic biodegradation product of quinoline in an aquifer study(2). Using a mixed culture in a biofilm under nitrate-reducing conditions, influent concns between 15 and 5,000 ug/l were transformed by hydroxylation to 2-hydroxyquinoline and further methylated at the homocyclic ring to 3,4-dihydro-2-quinoline(3). Quinoline was degraded under groundwater conditions to oxygenated analogs of the parent compound(4). Under methanogenic conditions, after a 6 month acclimation, methane production was 85% of the expected amount, indicating that quinoline could be anaerobically degraded(4). Quinoline at a concn of 15 mg/l was biodegraded to hydroxylated products in freshwater sediment slurries incubated under methanogenic conditions at 23 to 25 \u00b0C for a period of 80 days(5). Quinoline was degraded under sulfate-reducing conditions using microorganisms obtained from a creosote-contaminated aquifer in Pensacola, FL(6)."

            "Value": "Quinoline is carcinogenic to the liver in rodents, but it is not clear whether it acts by a genotoxic mechanism. We previously demonstrated that quinoline does induce gene mutation in the liver of lambda/lacZ transgenic mice. In the present report, we reveal the molecular nature of the mutations induced by quinoline in the lambda cII gene, which is also a phenotypically selectable marker in the lambda transgene. (The cII gene has 294bp, which enables much easier sequence analysis than the original lacZ gene (3kb)). The liver cII mutant frequency was nine times higher in quinoline-treated mice than in control mice. Sequence analysis revealed that quinoline induced primarily G:C to C:G transversions (25 of 34). Thus, we have confirmed that quinoline is genotoxic in its target organ, and the G:C to C:G transversion is the molecular signature of quinoline-induced mutations."

            "Value": "Quinoline is carcinogenic to the liver of rats and mice and mutagenic to bacterial tester strains in the presence of rat liver microsomal enzymes. The unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) study suggested that quinoline might be a non-genotoxic carcinogen because of the lack of UDS-inducing capacity. In order to determine whether or not cancer induction is initiated by mutagenic DNA lesions, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the mutagenicity of quinoline in an in vivo mutation assay system using the lac Z transgenic mouse (Muta Mouse). Mutation was only induced in the liver, the target organ of carcinogenesis by quinoline, but not in the other organs examined, i.e. lung, kidney and spleen. Mutant frequency in the liver was 4-fold higher than in the untreated control animals. Dimethylnitrosamine, used as a positive control, induced mutation at a frequency 5-fold higher in the liver and 3-fold higher in the spleen than in their respective control organs. It can be concluded that the genotoxicity of quinoline is responsible for its hepatocarcinogenesis, although UDS was not induced under the conditions previously reported."

            "Value": "Induction of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) was studied in hepatocytes of F344 rats exposed in vivo to the hepatocarcinogen quinoline (Q). Hepatocytes were isolated 4-48 hr after a single dose of 200 mg/kg body weight or 24 hr after 28 repeated doses (once a day) of 25-200 mg/kg body weight/day by gastric intubation, and allowed to proliferate in Williams' medium E supplemented with epidermal growth factor. Cells were fixed after a culture period of 48 hr. A single dose of Q induced chromosome aberrations in up to 22% of metaphase cells, and SCEs with a frequency of up to 1.27 per chromosome 12 hr after the dose, while the control values were 1% and 0.63 per chromosome, respectively. Treatment with 28 repeated doses of Q induced significant chromosome aberrations and SCEs dose-dependently. Cytogenetic damage induced induced in the liver by repeated doses of Q was greater than induced by a single dose. Furthermore, Q induced replicative DNA synthesis in the liver, but failed to induce micronucleus formation in the bone marrow. The noncarcinogen 8-hydroxyquinoline was also examined and found to be essentially non-genotoxic to rat liver. These results show that Q is a genotoxic carcinogen to rat liver and the present method of in vivo cytogenetic assay should be useful for evaluating the genotoxicity of hepatocarcinogens."

Mice were intraperitoneally treated in single injections with three dose levels (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) of each chemical with corn oil as solvent vehicle. Bone marrow was sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hr postinjection. Quinoline resulted in a significant dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE) at the 24 h sampling time for all doses tested. The high dose (100 mg/kg) and the medium dose (50 mg/kg) also induced statistically significant increases (P <.05) in the number of MPCEs at 48 hr interval. The ratios of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes at the 24 h sampling time were lower for the treated than the control animals. Although HOQ resulted in some increases in the number of MPCEs over the control, this compound induced a statistically significant increase in the number of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (MNCEs) at all three doses following 24 hr treatment. Both low and medium doses also induced a higher incidence of MNCEs at the 48 and 72 hr sampling times. No data were available for the high dose at these times. The cytotoxic effect of this compound was expressed as low PCE/NCE ratios with all doses at 24 hr after injection and as a high mortality rate in animals treated with the high dose (100 mg/kg)."

Several chemically related agents were also evaluated for their anticalculus effects. The most effective anticalculus agent was 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate. At concentrations of 4 or 5%, swabbed over molar teeth, it was essentially equally effective in retarding the formation of rat calculus. Significant (1% level) reduction occurred with concentration as low as 3% in rats. When used so as to mimic mouthrinse use, 4% 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate also significantly (5% level) reduced formation of calculus in rats. All rats showed normal behavioral and weight-gain patterns. Visual evaluation of oral tissues in the swabbing tests plus visual and histopathological evaluation of oral tissues in the mouthrinse procedure showed 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate had no irritating or toxic effects. In dogs, the teeth treated with 4% 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate nine times during a five-day period had 93.7 to 98.4% less buccal plaque than vehicle-treated teeth. The antiplaque effect was considerable in both canines and fourth premolars. In older dogs, teeth treated with 4% 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate 15 times during a ten-day period had 33 to 46.1% less plaque than when treated with the vehicle. The effect was considerable on canines but slight on fourth premolars. In older dogs after 24 treatments during a 15-day period, 4% 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate removed 25 to 57.5% of established plaque whereas the vehicle removed 2.5 to 22.5%. Again, 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate was more effective on canine buccal plaque. These results show that 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate is an effective anticalculus and antiplaque agent that is nontoxic to animal oral tissue. The results also indicate that the dog is a suitable animal model for the evaluation of antiplaque agents. /8-Hydroxy quinoline sulfate/"

            "Value": "The measured log Koc for quinoline is 2.84(1). The adsorption coefficients of quinoline to Ca-montmorillonite and creek sediments are 7.3 and 10.9, respectively(2). A Koc of 43 was reported using low-organic-carbon subsurface materials(11). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that quinoline is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Quinoline was found to be relatively mobile using a Danish sandy soil(10). Intensity of quinoline added to a natural sand aquifer on the Canadian Air Force Base Borden, Ontario, Canada via a field study using coal tar creosote were found to increase after 278 days, about 25 m from the croesote source, added at an initial concn of 10.1 g/kg creosote(4). Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(7,8), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). The pKa of quinoline is 4.90(5), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(6); therefore, adsorption increases with increasing soil acidity(11). Sorption onto airborne particulates has been observed(9). A Kd value of 0.83 was measured using a Danish sandy soil from Lundgaard, Jutland, characterized by 2.47% organic carbon content, 80.2% sand, 13.2% silt, 4.8% clay, and a pH of 5.8(10)."
