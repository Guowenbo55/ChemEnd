    "Description": "Benazolin is a member of the class of benzothiazoles that is 4-chloro-1,3-benzothiazol-2(3H)-one which is substituted on the nitrogen by a carboxymethyl group and at position 4 by chlorine. A post-emergence herbicide used (generally as a salt or ester) for the control of annual weeds in wheat and oilseed rape. It is not approved for use with the European Union. It has a role as a herbicide and a synthetic auxin. It is a member of benzothiazoles, a monocarboxylic acid and an organochlorine pesticide. It is a conjugate acid of a benazolin(1-).",

Wheeler], turnip rape (Brassica campestris L. \u2018Echo\u2019), and rape (Brassica napus L. \u2018Target\u2019) was investigated with the aid of 14C-benazolin. The label was more mobile in wild mustard than the rape species following leaf treatment and accumulated in young leaves, stem, and stem apex. The label was also found in foliage after root treatment. In both cases, the translocated label was primarily that of 14C-benazolin, implying phloem and xylem transport. The susceptibility of wild mustard and tolerance of the rape species to foliar-applied benazolin can be partly explained by different rates of transport to susceptible meristematic sites. Root exudation of the label following leaf treatment was greater in wild mustard than in the rape species and was not correlated with selectivity. Labeled benazolin was rapidly metabolized by the Brassica species to four derivatives which appear to be less toxic than benazolin. Specific differences in metabolism were not sufficient to explain selectivity. Negligible amounts of 14CO2 were released by the three species following treatment with 14C-benazolin.",
