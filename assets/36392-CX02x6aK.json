It was found that groundnut absorbed about twice the amount of fluchloralin compared to pigweed during continuous application over 4 and 8 days. Groundnut retained 80% of the absorbed [14C] in the roots after 8 days, while pigweed showed rapid translocation to the leaves, with 45% and 70% of the absorbed [14C] found in the leaves at 1 and 8 days after application, respectively. Pigweed also exhibited different patterns of fluchloralin metabolism compared to groundnut, with most of the herbicide being metabolized by pigweed roots. The tolerance of pigweed to fluchloralin and the sensitivity of groundnut can be attributed to differential root absorption, translocation, and metabolism of the herbicide. The accumulation of absorbed fluchloralin in the roots of groundnut may contribute to the inhibition of crop plant growth.",
