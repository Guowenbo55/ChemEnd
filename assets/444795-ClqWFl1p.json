    "Description": "All-trans-retinoic acid is a retinoic acid in which all four exocyclic double bonds have E- (trans-) geometry. It has a role as a keratolytic drug, an antineoplastic agent, an antioxidant, a signalling molecule, a retinoid X receptor agonist, an anti-inflammatory agent, an AP-1 antagonist, a retinoic acid receptor agonist and a human metabolite. It is a retinoic acid and a vitamin A. It is a conjugate acid of an all-trans-retinoate.",

            "Value": "Although the precise mechanism(s) of action of tretinoin has not been fully elucidated, it is known that the drug is not a cytolytic agent. Tretinoin induces cellular differentiation and decreases the proliferation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. The PML/RAR-a fusion protein resulting from the chromosomal translocation appears to block myeloid differentiation at the promyelocyte stage, possibly by complexing and inactivating wild-type PML or by inhibiting the normal retinoic acid signaling pathway. In patients with APL who achieve a complete remission with tretinoin therapy, the drug causes an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the cellular leukemic clone followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells. Observations supporting cellular differentiation effects as a mechanism of tretinoin include the absence of bone marrow hypoplasia during induction, the appearance of immunophenotypically unique \"intermediate cells\" expressing both mature and immature cell surface antigens, and the presence of both Auer rods and the translocation in morphologically mature granulocytes until a late stage of induction. The mechanism by which the population of malignant cells is eliminated is not fully understood but appears to involve apoptosis (programmed cell death). Following induction therapy, the PML/RAR-a fusion protein can be detected in the majority of patients, suggesting that tretinoin alone does not eradicate the leukemic clone."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of all-trans-retinoic acid can be estimated to be 2.0X10+4(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that all-trans-retinoic acid is expected to be immobile soil. The estimated pKa of all-trans-retinoic acid is 4.76(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4)."
