    "Description": "Thiencarbazone-methyl is an N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfur atom is attached to a 4-(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methylthiophen-3-yl group and in which the non-sulfonated nitrogen is substituted by a 3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl group. It is a herbicide used for the selective control of grasses and broadleaf weeds primarily in corn. It has a role as an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a member of thiophenes, a methyl ester, a member of triazoles, a N-sulfonylurea and an ether. It is functionally related to a thiencarbazone.",

Forty-eight hours after foliar microapplication, 14C-TCM absorption was highest in ivyleaf morningglory (60%), followed by field bindweed (50%), wild buckwheat (35%), tall morningglory (17%), and hedge bindweed (9%). In all species, 14C-TCM was translocated systemically. By 24 h after application, 14C-TCM was detected in all parts of the plants. The translocation pattern is species-specific, with more translocation in tall morningglory and wild buckwheat. In all vining weeds 14C-TCM was almost not metabolized whereas corn metabolized almost all 14C-TCM 48 h after application. The efficacy of TCM was analyzed using dose\u2013response curves. Wild buckwheat had the lowest value for the dose at which 50% of the activity occurs (2.1 g ai ha\u22121 TCM), followed by hedge bindweed and ivyleaf morningglory. Field studies confirmed the high control of wild buckwheat with TCM. Even at the lowest tested concentration of TCM, wild buckwheat was controlled by over 90%. In contrast, efficacy of TCM in field trials against perennial vining weeds was very low, 25% for field bindweed and 65% against hedge bindweed. Control efficacy could be well explained by the translocation pattern of TCM in vining weeds.",
