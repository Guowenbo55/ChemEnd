    "Description": "Urea is a carbonyl group with two C-bound amine groups. The commercially available fertilizer has an analysis of 46-0-0 (N-P2O5-K2O). It has a role as a flour treatment agent, a human metabolite, a Daphnia magna metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a fertilizer. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide and a one-carbon compound. It is functionally related to a carbonic acid. It is a tautomer of a carbamimidic acid.",

In 3-day static-system tests using golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus), the BCF of urea was <10(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Urea is rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonia and carbon dioxide in environmental systems by the extracellular enzyme, urease, which originates from microorganisms and plant roots(1). The degradation of urea was examined in a river die-away study using various river waters and test conditions(2). At 20 \u00b0C, degradation was complete within 6-14 days of incubation while at lower temperatures (e.g., 4-12 \u00b0C), little or no degradation occurred in 10-14 days in some waters(2). Below 8 \u00b0C (simulating winter conditions), a maximum daily degradation of 3-6% was observed during the first 7 days of incubation(2). Depending upon the source of the water, degradation under aerobic conditions varied from slightly faster to more than twice as fast as compared to anaerobic conditions(2). In a river die-away, 1.05-2.20% of added urea hydrolyzed after 10-days while only 0.35% hydrolyzed in sterile controls(3). Urea was completely biodegraded in aerobic biodegradation studies using activated sludge inoculum and a 14-day incubation period(4). In degradation studies using estuary and coastal waters from Georgia, avg urea degradation rates of 6.2 to 19.6 nmoles/l hr were observed(5); phytoplankton was responsible for urea decomposition in these waters(5). Using an activated sludge seed, 85.9% of the theoretical carbon dioxide production was measured from urea biodegradation over a 5-day incubation period(6). In another study, 66% of urea at initial concn of approx 0.1 mg/l biodegraded in a soil-water suspension at 35 \u00b0C after 5 days(7). In 4-day carbon dioxide evolution tests using waters collected from three regions of the Pacific Ocean, gas evolution was observed to be much faster in sunlight than in dark controls (e.g., ratio of light to light+dark was 61.6-86.4%)(8); the reason for the accelerated rate in sunlight is that urea is actively decomposed by photosynthesis of phytoplankton that occurs in seawater(8)."

There is an increase in anaerobic glycolysis, blood glucose, and blood lactate ... . Acidosis is manifested. The exact means by which ammonia blocks the citric acid cycle is not known. It is postulated that ammonia saturation of the glutamine-synthesizing system causes a backing-up in the citrate cycle, a decrease in its intermediates, and a decrease in energy production and cellular respiration, which leads to convulsions ... . The decrease of citrate cycle intermediates is postulated to result from reamination of pyruvic, ketoglutaric, and oxaloacetic acids."

            "Value": "Intravenous urea in monkeys has not damaged the ciliary epithelium, supporting a belief that reduction of intraocular pressure in glaucomatous patients is accomplished by an osmotic, rather than a toxic mechanism. However, intracarotid injection of concentrated urea in monkeys has done dramatic damage to the retina and the ciliary body. Retinal pigment epithelial cells are affected and blood-retina barrier broken down. The blood-aqueous barrier is broken down secondary to changes in the capillaries and selective damage to the ciliary body epithelium. Intraocular pressure is strikingly reduced and the aqueous outflow system rapidly shows swelling of the connective tissue of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal, and then edema of the trabecular meshwork. However, in several weeks there is general return to normal, except for failure of pigmented ciliary epithelium to regenerate."

No adsorption was measurable in five of the soils(1). In a sixth soil (36.5% organic carbon), a Koc of 8 can be determined from the Freundlich isotherm(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that urea is expected to have high mobility in soil. However, it has been reported that urea can adsorb to humic acids by free-radical complexation(3). Complexed urea may adsorb to soil more strongly than uncomplexed urea(SRC)."
