    "Description": "Dimethoate is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is N-methylacetamide in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group attached to the carbonyl moiety is replaced by a (dimethoxyphosphorothioyl)sulfanediyl group. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an agrochemical, an acaricide, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an insecticide, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is an organic thiophosphate and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It is functionally related to a N-methyl-2-sulfanylacetamide.",

Biodegradation may play a minor role in the disappearance of dimethoate in the river water; no experiments were conducted with sterilized river water(1). Half-lives of 171, 173 and 219 days were given for river water, filtered river water and sea water, respectively at 6 \u00b0C, and 43, 29 and 36 days at 22 \u00b0C(2). Percent degradation in chehalis clay loam soil in 2 wk, non-sterile, 77%, autoclaved, 18%, irradiated, 20%(3). Half-lives in soil in June-July averaged 11 days, and less than 2% of applied dimethoate residue detected after 10 months(3). Dimethoate half-lives in soil from Zhejiang Province, China were given as 5.1 and 7.1 days in 1989 and 1990, respectively(4). Dimethoate was given a half-life of 7 days(5-7) and 11 days(8) in an unspecified field soil sample. In laboratory experiments at 20-30 \u00b0C half-lives for degradation were 28.9 and 36.7 days(3). However, dimethoate degraded faster when incubated for 30 days in samples of autoclaved sand, sandy clay loam, loam, and clay soils than in similarly treated nonsterile soils(9). Biodegradation appears to depend on the soil type and the microorganisms present in the soil(9). A half-life of 122 days has been observed in soil(10) which also suggests that biodegradation of dimethoate can be slow. In moist soils, dimethoate is readily oxidized to dimethoxon(11), but the role of microbial degradation on the removal of dimethoate from the environment is uncertain(12). Recovery of dimethoate incubated with enrichment cultures using raw sewage: 0 days, 54 ppm; 0.5 days, 54 ppm; 1 day, 52.5 ppm; 6 days, 22.4 ppm; 9 days, 13.5 ppm; 12 days, not detected(13). Using an initial concn of 100 mg/L dimethoate, 0-17 %Theoretical BOD was observed after a 4 week period in a biodegradation screening test using 30 mg/L sludge(14).

Fruiting cotton plants treated with a dimethoate soil drench accumulated small amounts in squares and bolls above ground, demonstrating translocation from roots to distant shoot structures. Less than 1 microgram was found in square stamens/pistils where bollworm larvae fed. Additionally, young cotton plants absorbed dimethoate from nutrient solutions at a slower rate than water uptake. Plants deficient in phosphorus absorbed less dimethoate from solutions than complete nutrient solutions.

Specifically, emulsifiable concentrates of these insecticides were applied to the soil surface of rice plants, and the penetration, translocation, and accompanying insecticidal activity were examined. The results showed that disulfoton exhibited high concentrations in the underground parts of the rice plant shortly after application, indicating rapid penetration into the underground parts. Dimethoate showed almost equal concentrations in both the above-ground and underground parts, suggesting that it can easily penetrate and translocate within the plant body. In contrast, the penetration and translocation of vamidothion were gradual, while those of thiometon and mecarbam were weak. The increase in mortality of the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) in an insecticide bioassay conducted using the same application method corresponded roughly to the increase in insecticide concentrations in the above-ground parts. At the end of the experiment (6 days after application), residues of vamidothion were low.",
