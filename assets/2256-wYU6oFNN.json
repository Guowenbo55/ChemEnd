The percent atrazine remaining from rhizosphere and edaphosphere (non-vegetated) soil samples collected at an agrochemicals dealership in Iowa was determined to be approximately 55% in the rhizosphere and 75% in the edaphosphere, suggesting that the microbial activity of Kochia sp in the rhizosphere soil increased atrazine degradation(2). Atrazine was found to exhibit a half-life of about 30 days in soil samples collected from the top surface (10 cm) from the Ebro delta, Tarragona, Spain between 1989 and 1991; deethyl atrazine was the major degradate formed, with deisopropylatrazine detected in one sample(3). Degradation studies of atrazine in subsoils from an Atlantic coastal plain watershed revealed 13.3 to 25.0% carbon dioxide evolution from sandy loam soils, indicating that atrazine was not appreciably mineralized in the soils(4). In a study using a Port Byron silt loam soil (pH 5.4), 68% of the applied radio-labeled atrazine was present 16 months after treatment; hydroxyatrazine was the major degradation product(5). Atrazine had half-lives of 20-360 days, observed in laboratory studies conducted with loamy soil from a corn field in Bologna, Italy(6). The shortest half-lives were observed for soils inoculated at temperatures of 35 \u00b0C, while the longest half-lives observed occurred at 5 \u00b0C(7). Experiments with s-triazine-adapted Colorado soil (35.2% sand, 28% silt, 36.8% clay, 19 g C/kg organic matter and pH 7.9) had atrazine degradation half-lives of 2.0 to 28.2 days(7). Experiments with s-triazine-adapted Mississippi soil (15.8% sand, 47.2% silt, 36.7% clay, 13 g C/Kg organic matter and pH 6.67) had atrazine degradation half-lives of 0.8 to 5.6 days(7). The biodegradation half-life of atrazine in adapted surface soil was 5-18 days, half-lives increased with soil depth to 43 days at 80-110 cm depth, in unadapted soils surface half-lives were 56-72 days and 156-186 days in subsurface unadapted soils; studies were conducted in Northern Greece(8)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Atrazine was degraded 23% in 96 hours when incubated in raw seawater obtained from the Pacific Ocean(1). Atrazine had half-lives of 340-7900 and 19-120 hours in unexposed and re-exposed sediment/water samples, respectively, collected from Lake Superior, Superior Harbor and St. Louis River(2). Microorganisms in aerobic incubations of alluvial aquifer sediment mineralized <0.1-1.5% of added radio-labeled atrazine; carbon dioxide production was greater in shallow sediment (<6 m) than in deep sediment (>17 m)(3). Atrazine degradation in silty loam and sand samples collected from Hesse, Germany was investigated; microbial degradation of atrazine occurred in alkaline soil with the primary metabolites of desethyl atrazine and deisopropylatrazine while chemical degradation of atrazine yielded hydroxyatrazine; in addition, atrazine degraded 3-4 times faster in soils at 25 \u00b0C than at 10 \u00b0C(4). Measures of CO2 evolution from atrazine labeled with (14)C at the ethyl or propyl groupings(5) have demonstrated that dealkylation is the major mechanism involved in microbial degradation of atrazine(6-7). Decomposition studies of (14)C ring labeled atrazine evolve (14)CO2 at slow rates, indicating the s-triazine ring is fairly resistant to microbial degradation(5-7). Aerobic half-lives of atrazine in wetland samples from Columbus, OH region ranged from 4.6 to 1734 days, dependent on location and depth of sample(8)."

Our investigations on the role of pesticides in liver dysfunctions have led us to detect an inhibition of FSP1 expression of 70% at 50 um and around 95% at 500 uM of ATZ (p<0.01). This gene encodes the protein S100a4 and is a clinical biomarker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in the metastatic process. Here we investigated the possible effect of ATZ on cell migration and noticed that it prevents the EMT and motility of the HepG2 cells induced by the phorbol ester TPA. ATZ decreases Fak pathway activation but has no effect on the Erk1/2 pathway known to be involved in metastasis in this cell line. These results suggest that ATZ could be involved in cell homeostasis perturbation, potentially through a S100a4-dependant mechanism."

Similarly, oestradiol 2-hydroxylase (ED2H) activity was also significantly decreased by 28-51% by atrazine and simazine at all doses. However, no change in CYP2C11 protein level by either chloro-s-triazine was observed. K(m) for T2AH was significantly increased only by simazine (200 umol/kg), whereas the Vmax and Cl(int) for T2AH were significantly decreased by atrazine and simazine at all doses. 7-Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), 7-methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD) and 7-pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase (PROD) activities were significantly increased by 1.4-1.6-, 1.7-3.2- and 1.5-2.2-fold respectively, by both chloro-s-triazines at 200 or 400 umol/kg.

These results suggest that the pattern of changes in P450 isoforms by chloro-s-triazines differs between atrazine and simazine, that these herbicides change the constitutive and/or male specific P450 isoform(s) in rat liver, and that these changes closely relate to the toxicity of chloro-s-triazines"

Here, male mice were exposed to 50 ug/kg BW/day CYP, 100 ug/kg BW/day ATZ or 1 ug/kg BW/day EE2 supplied in their drinking water for 20 weeks. During the exposure, mice were fed a high energy diet (HD). The bodyweights were not significantly affected by chronic exposure to EDCs, while the serum-free fatty acids (FFA) levels, hepatic lipid accumulation and triacylglycerol (TG) contents increased significantly in the ATZ- and CYP-HD groups. To determine the mechanism involved, we determined the expression levels of the genes in the glucose and fat metabolism pathways in the liver and adipose tissue. The results showed that chronic exposure to ATZ and CYP increased the mRNA levels of a number of key genes involved in both the de novo FFA synthesis pathway and the transport of FFA from blood. The increased amount of FFA was partially consumed as energy through beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Some of the FFA was used to synthesize TG in the liver by up-regulating primary genes, which resulted in increased TG levels and lipid accumulation. The results indicate that chronic exposure to EDCs has the potential to cause energy metabolic dysregulation and hepatotoxicity in mice."

Atrazine was administered orally at 50 or 200 mg/kg of body weight dose for 28 consecutive days. In order to assess possible structural alterations, tissue sections were examined histologically and then subjected to quantification analysis using stereological methods. The tissue specimens were routinely processed and stained with Mallory trichrome method in order to clearly distinguish muscle cells from the connective tissue components. A toluidine blue staining method was additionally used for the demonstration of mast cells. Statistically significant increase in length density and numerical density of capillaries were found at both the investigated doses of atrazine compared with the control. The increase in surface density and volume density of capillaries found at lower dosage of atrazine was significant in comparison with the control. The extensive mast cell degranulation was noted on the histological examination at both doses of the applied chemical. No significant changes were demonstrated for the stereological parameters of cardiomyocytes. Based on the available published data and the present results, it can be concluded that atrazine promoted angiogenesis in the rat myocardium, which might be partially mediated by mast cells."

To test this hypothesis, suckling-induced prolactin release was measured in Wistar dams treated twice daily with the herbicide atrazine (atrazine, by gavage, on PND 1-4 at 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg body weight), or twice daily with the dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine (BROM, sc, at 0.052, 0.104, 0.208, and 0.417 mg/kg); BROM is known to suppress prolactin release. Similarly, atrazine has also been reported to suppress prolactin in adult females. Serum prolactin was measured on PND 3 using a serial sampling technique and indwelling cardiac catheters. A significant rise in serum prolactin release was noted in all control females within 10 min of the initiation of suckling. Fifty-mg/kg atrazine inhibited suckling-induced prolactin release in all females, whereas 25 and 12.5 mg/kg atrazine inhibited this measure in some dams and had no discernible effect in others. The 6.25 mg/kg dose of atrazine was without effect. BROM, used here as a positive control, also inhibited suckling-induced prolactin release at doses of 0.104 to 0.417 mg/kg, with no effect at 0.052 mg/kg. To examine the effect of postnatal atrazine and BROM on the incidence and severity of inflammation (INF) of the lateral prostate of the offspring, adult males were examined at 90 and 120 days. While no effect was noted at 90 days of age, at 120 days, both the incidence and severity of prostate inflammation was increased in those offspring of atrazine-treated dams (25 and 50 mg/kg). The 12.5 mg/kg atrazine and the two highest doses of BROM increased the incidence, but not the severity, of prostatitis. Combined treatment of ovine prolactin (oPRL) and 25 or 50 mg/kg atrazine on PND 1-4 reduced the incidence of inflammation observed at 120 days, indicating that this increase in INF, seen after atrazine alone, resulted from the suppression of prolactin in the dam. To determine whether or not there is a critical period for these effects, dams were dosed with 25 and 50 mg/kg on PND 6-9 and PND 11-14. Inflammation was increased in those offspring from dams treated on PND 6-9, but this increase was not significant. Dosing on PND 11-14 was without effect. These data demonstrate that atrazine suppresses suckling-induced prolactin release and that this suppression results in lateral prostate inflammation in the offspring. The critical period for this effect is PND 1-9."

At the termination of the study, the average body weight of rats receiving atrazine at 100 mg/kg per day was found to be reduced by approximately 9%. This suggested the possibility that the effects of atrazine on the reproductive tract may not be direct, but rather, the noted deficits of the male reproductive tract resulted from reduced food intake by the treated rats. We tested this by feeding control (vehicle-gavaged) rats amounts of food equivalent to that consumed by the atrazine-fed rats, and then assessing reproductive tract endpoints. Even mild food restriction resulted in reductions in serum testosterone concentration, in the weights of androgen-dependent organs, and in serum LH concentration; the same deficits that were seen in atrazine-gavaged rats. Indeed, the effects of atrazine on the male reproductive tract seen in rats receiving atrazine at greater than 50 mg/kg per day could not be distinguished from the effects of reduced food consumption."

After every ATR injection we found hypoactivity that lasted up to five days, and it was accompanied by reductions in levels of striatal DA, DOPAC, and HVA without any alteration in the striatal expression of the mRNAs for Mn-SOD, Trx-1, DAR-D(1), or DAR-D(2). In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens no changes in monoamine markers were observed, and a down-regulation of Trx-1 expression was detected shortly after the ATR treatment. Moreover, in the ventral midbrain, we found that ATR induced a down-regulation of mRNA for Th and DAT, but it increased VMAT2 mRNA expression.

In both acutely- and chronically-treated animals, serum and intratesticular levels of testosterone were significantly reduced by approximately 50%. For in vitro exposures, Leydig cells isolated from rats on pnd 49 were co-cultured with 232 microM atrazine in the presence of a maximally stimulating concentration of luteinizing hormone. Compared with cells cultured with vehicle and luteinizing hormone alone, testosterone production by Leydig cells treated with atrazine was reduced by 35%. A similar decrease was observed when Leydig cells were stimulated with dibuterol cAMP (db-cAMP) in lieu of luteinizing hormone, but not when cells were stimulated with hydroxycholesterol, indicating that the effects of atrazine on testosterone production can be bypassed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that atrazine acts as an endocrine disrupter in rat males by directly inhibiting Leydig cell testosterone production."

One dose of atrazine (300 mg/kg) suppressed the LH and prolactin surge in ovariectomized LE, but not SD female rats. Atrazine (300 mg/kg) administered to intact LE females on the day of vaginal proestrus was without effect on ovulation but did induce a pseudopregnancy in 7 of 9 females. Three daily doses of atrazine suppressed the estrogen-induced LH and prolactin surges in ovariectomized LE females in a dose-dependent manner, but this same treatment was without effect on serum LH and prolactin in SD females. The estrogen-induced surges of both pituitary hormones were suppressed by atrazine (75-300 mg/kg/day) in a dose-dependent manner in females of both strains evaluated after 21 days of treatment. Three experiments were then performed to determine whether the brain, pituitary, or both organs were the target sites for the chlorotriazines. These included examination of the ability of (1) the pituitary lactotrophs to secrete prolactin, using hypophyosectomized females bearing pituitary autotransplants (ectopic pituitaries); (2) the synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to induce LH secretion in females treated with high concentrations of atrazine for 3 days; and (3) atrazine (administered in vivo or in vitro) to suppress LH and prolactin secretion from pituitaries, using a flow-through perifusion procedure. In conclusion, the results of these studies demonstrate that atrazine alters LH and prolactin serum levels in the LE and SD female rats by altering the hypothalamic control of these hormones. In this regard, the LE female appeared to be more sensitive to the hormone suppressive effects of atrazine, as indicated by the decreases observed on treatment-day 3."

It is currently unknown whether environmental chemicals can induce changes associated with premature luteinization. Using rat granulosa cells (GC) in vitro, we demonstrated that exposure to atrazine(ATR), a widely used herbicide, causes GC phenotype that resembles that of human premature luteinization. At the end of the 48-h stimulation with FSH, ATR-exposed GC showed (1) higher levels of progesterone, (2) overexpression of luteal markers (Star and Cyp11a1), and (3) an increase in progesterone:estradiol ratio above 1. Mechanistic experiments were conducted to understand the signaling events engaged by ATR that lead to this phenotype. Western blot analysis revealed prolonged phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in ATR- and FSH-exposed GC. An increased level of ERK1/2-dependent transcriptional factor CCATT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB) was observed after 4 hr of ATR exposure. Inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin) and MEK (U0126) prevented ATR-induced rise in progesterone level and expression of luteal markers in FSH-stimulated GC. Atrazine intensified AKT and CEBPB signaling and caused Star overexpression in forskolin-stimulated GC but not in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated GC. In the presence of rolipram, a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), ATR was not able to further elevate AKT phosphorylation, CEBPB protein level, and Star mRNA in FSH-stimulated GC, suggesting that ATR inhibits PDE4. Overall, this study showed that ATR acts as a FSH sensitizer leading to enhanced cAMP, AKT, and CEBPB signaling and progesterone biosynthesis, which promotes premature luteinization phenotype in GC."

Previous work has shown that exposure to high doses of ATR in rats results in blunting of the hormone-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and inhibition of pulsatile LH release without significantly reducing pituitary sensitivity to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. Accompanying the reduction in the LH surge was an attenuation of GnRH neuronal activation. These findings suggest that ATR exposure may be acting to inhibit GnRH release. In this study, we examined GnRH directly to determine the effect of high doses of ATR on GnRH pulsatile release, gene expression, and peptide levels in the female rat. Ovariectomized adult female Wistar rats were treated with ATR (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 days via gavage. Following the final treatment, GnRH release was measured from ex vivo hypothalamic explants for 3 hr. In another experiment, animals were administered either vehicle or ATR (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) daily for 4 days. Following treatment, in situ hybridization was performed to examine total GnRH mRNA and the primary GnRH heterogeneous nuclear RNA transcript. Finally, GnRH immunoreactivity and total peptide levels were measured in hypothalamic tissue of treated animals. ATR treatment resulted in no changes to GnRH gene expression, peptide levels, or immunoreactivity but a reduction in GnRH pulse frequency and an increased pulse amplitude. These findings suggest that ATR acts to inhibit the secretory dynamics of GnRH pulses without interfering with GnRH mRNA and protein synthesis."

The CL(50) /European for LC50/, CL(50/2) and CL(50/5) concentrations of both herbicides were tested. The spermatozoa were incubated with the herbicides during 4 and 4.5 hours (capacitated and reacted, respectively) at 39 \u00b0C in a humid atmosphere and 5% CO2. The acrosomal reaction was induced by adding progesterone during the last half hour of incubation. The negative control was under the same conditions, with no herbicides. Capacitation and acrosomal reaction were evaluated using the chlortetracycline stain and viability using the eosin-nigrosine stain. The experiments were done at least three times. Control values were considered as 100%. Sperm viability with both herbicides decreased significantly as concentration was increased. The CL50 for atrazine was 40 uM and for fenoxaprop-ethyl was 60 uM. Results demonstrate that both herbicides increased the capacitated and acrosome-reacted spermatozoa respect to the control. The action of atrazine begin at 8 uM, the capacitated spermatozoa increased to 152-155% and reacted to 153-172% as dose increased, but it was not concentration dependant. The fenoxaprop-ethyl increased capacitation to 189-279% and acrosomal reaction to 143-200%, clearly presenting a concentration-response effect. Both compounds showed significant differences when compared to the negative control."

ATZ (175, 87.5, and 43.75 mg/kg bw/day) was administered by gavage method for 28 days. The following indexes were determined in various groups of mice: body and organ weight; antibody aggregation of serum hemolysin; proliferative response of splenocytes to ConA; delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH); natural killer cell activity; clearance of neutral red and nitric oxide (NO) release from peritoneal macrophages; apostosis and necrosis of splenocytes and thymocytes; cytokine production; and serum lysozyme. Results showed that cell-mediated, humoral immunity, and non-specific immune function in the high-dose ATZ group were suppressed; NO release and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/interleukin-4 (IL-4) were also significantly decreased in the high-dose group. In the medium-dose group, the proliferation response and IFN-gamma production was significantly decreased. In the low-dose group, the proliferation response was significantly decreased. Serum lysozyme was decreased in the ATZ-treated groups. The percentage of early apoptosis in thymocytes was increased significantly in high- and medium-dose ATZ groups. In conclusion, ATZ elicited an inhibitory effect on cell-mediated immunity, humoral immunity, and non-specific immune function of mice."

Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) from one Gram-negative representative strain Escherichia coli K12 and one Gram-positive representative strain Bacillus subtilis B19, respectively, were tested for response to atrazine stress. The results indicated that SOD, CAT, GST and T-AOC were induced upon exposure to atrazine. The growth of two bacteria was better in the absence than in the presence of atrazine, indicating that atrazine can decrease bacterial growth. The changes of enzyme activities indicate the presence of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by atrazine may be due to imbalance of redox potential in bacterial cells, which leads to bacterial metabolic disorder."

The adsorption of atrazine by aluminum montmorillonite was 0.37 mole/g at pH 6.0, by aluminum montmorillonite + sodium hydroxide was 2.70 mole/g at pH 7.4, and by aluminum hydroxide was 0.50 mole/g at pH 6.2; the adsorption of atrazine by iron montmorillonite was 0.94 mole/g at pH 4.6, by iron montmorillonite + sodium hydroxide was 1.50 mole/g at pH 5.7, and by iron hydroxide was 0.32 mole/g at pH 7.5(4). At an initial concentration of 100 ug/L atrazine, the amount of atrazine adsorbed by montmorillonite at pH 4.5 and pH 9.5 was determined to be 4.4 and 1.65 ug/L, respectively; the amount of atrazine adsorbed by kaolinite at pH 4.5 and pH 9.5 was determined to be 0.02 and 0.03 ug/L, respectively(5).

Hydroponic experiments were conducted using a concentration of 10 mg L\u22121 for both herbicides. The findings indicate that acetochlor is taken up by wheat roots through the apoplastic pathway and primarily accumulates in the roots with limited upward translocation. In contrast, atrazine is taken up by roots through the symplastic pathway and subsequently transported to the stems and leaves. The preferential distribution of acetochlor in root organelles with higher lipid contents restricts its upward translocation, while atrazine exhibits easier upward translocation due to its low bioconcentration in root organelles and cell walls. The partition-limited model effectively predicts the uptake of acetochlor and atrazine by wheat roots and the distribution of atrazine to the stems and leaves. The results highlight the potential risk to the safety of wheat crops posed by residual atrazine in soil, as it can be taken up by wheat roots and acropetally translocated.",

The relationships between uptake and transpiration rate were discussed in the light of the physico-chemical properties of these compounds, notably their partition coefficients in oil/water systems and their dissociation constants. Apart from 2,4-D, sorption of these compounds appears to be a passive process. At pH 4, the uptake of 2,4-D seems to be influenced by metabolism; not only may the concentration of this compound in the transpiration stream be considerably greater than that in the medium surrounding the roots, but absorption by roots is markedly reduced at low temperatures and by sodium azide. The initial rate of uptake of these compounds correlates reasonably well with their partition coefficients in olive oil/water or ra-dodecane/water systems; likewise, the concentration in the transpiration stream is greater for lipophilic than for lipophobic substances. The hydrogen ion and calcium concentrations of the ambient medium appear to have no effect on the uptake of compounds with low pK's, but the uptake of those substances which protonate between pH 4 and pH 6 is affected by them. These findings are discussed from the viewpoint that the pathways of transport of lipophilic and lipophobic compounds across the roots may differ.",

Significant differences were observed among species in herbicide distribution within the plants. Carrot and parsnip seedlings retained a high proportion of absorbed linuron in their root systems, while lettuce and turnip translocated over 60% of absorbed linuron to the shoot. With atrazine, differences among species were less pronounced. The amount of herbicide translocated correlated with the amount of water transpired by the plants, but the effective concentrations in the transpiration stream were lower than in the treatment solutions. Thin-layer chromatography of plant extracts revealed that up to 45% of translocated linuron in parsnip and carrot was metabolized, while little metabolism occurred in the shoots of lettuce and turnip or in the roots of any species. These findings suggest that parsnip and carrot seedlings' tolerance to linuron is due to a combination of root fixation and metabolism in the shoot.",
