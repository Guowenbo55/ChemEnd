Miosis, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea & frequency of urination ... Nicotinic effects consist of fasciculation of muscles, weakness & paralysis. Central nervous system effects include nervousness, apprehension, ataxia, convulsions & coma. Death is due to resp failure, or sometimes cardiac arrest. There is little difference between signs produced by different organophosphorus compounds, but route of absorption may influence one system more than another. /Organophosphorus cmpd/"

            "Value": "The cardiovascular actions of anticholinesterase agents are complex, since they reflect both ganglionic and postganglionic effects of accumulated ACh on the heart and blood vessels. The predominant effect on the heart from the peripheral action of accumulated ACh is bradycardia, resulting in a fall in cardiac output. Higher doses usually cause a fall in blood pressure, often as a consequence of effects of anticholinesterase agents on the medullary vasomotor centers of the CNS. /Anticholinesterase agents/"

Residue analysis shows that the dimefox concentration in the hop plants reaches a peak about one week after application, which increases with the amount applied. Then a gradual breakdown sets in so that at the time of harvesting the differences between the dosages have virtually disappeared. Translocation of dimefox in the hop plant is very rapid, but the breakdown is faster at the top of the plant. Schradan concentrations were usually very low and residues at harvest time negligible.",
