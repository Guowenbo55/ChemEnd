The time-kill curve study showed that undecanol was fungicidal against S. cerevisiae at any growth stages was not influenced by pH values. The alcohols tested inhibited glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. The primary antifungal action of amphipathic medium-chain (C(9)-C(12)) alkanols comes mainly from their ability as nonionic surfactants to disrupt the native membrane-associated function of the integral proteins."

The flux of melatonin across hairless rat skin was found to be dependent on the carbon chain length of the fatty alcohols, with decanol showing the maximum permeation of melatonin. All fatty alcohols increased the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin blood flow significantly compared with the vehicle. The fatty alcohols (decanol, undecanol and lauryl alcohol), which showed greater permeation of melatonin, also produced greater TEWL, skin blood flow and erythema. Tridecanol and myristyl alcohol showed lower permeation enhancement effect but caused greater skin irritation."
