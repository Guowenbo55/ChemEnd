V79 cells were incubated with 50 or 100 ul of various concn of the test cmpd for 8 hr at 37 \u00b0C; mitotic indices were determined by counting metaphases in 500 cells. Chromosomes exposed to the test cmpd were stained in order to observe the chromosome numbers in a metaphase twice divided. The number of chromosomes in the V79 cells ranged from 20 to 25; metaphases which had 40 to 50 chromosomes were thus considered tetraploid cells. Observation of the metaphases in the sister chromatid exchange test revealed that only dimethylarsenic acid induced tetraploids and mitotic arrest. Tetraploid cells appeared to have low cell division ability or a slower cell cycle than diploid cells. Dimethylarsenic acid directly inhibited cell division and dimethylarsenic acid induced tetraploidy may be an important part of arsenic genotoxicity. This cmpd may be the ultimate carcinogen of arsenic."

Dimethylarsinic acid administered perorally at doses of 113, 85, and 57 mg/kg for 4 weeks produced dose-related decreases in body weight and survival rate in both sexes. Mortality was higher and appeared more quickly in females than in males. Histopathological findings in the kidney were proximal tubular degeneration and necrosis, as well as papillary necrosis, and hyperplasia of the epithelium covering the papillae. Since extensive proximal tubular necrosis was observed only in dead animals of both sexes, and not in survivors or the controls, it was concluded that the main cause of death could be attributed to nephrotoxicity of dimethylarsinic acid. The results thus show that dimethylarsinic acid is nephrotoxic to both male and female rats."

A histopathological study of the lung and liver in mice after dimethylarsinic acid administration was carried out by transmission electron microscopy. Ultrastructural alterations in the endothelial nuclei of the alveolar wall were observed 12-48 hr after administration. Heterochromatin tended to collect in a dense, compact mass lining the inner walls of the nucleus. A significant increase in heterochromatin induced by dimethylarsinic acid administration was observed by morphometric analysis. However, no substantial differences appeared in the sinusoidal endothelium of the liver. The much greater induction of morphological alterations, such as increased heterochromatin, in lung endothelial nuclei than in the liver might explain the high risk of lung cancer by arsenics, and that there may be a close relationship between heterochromatin alteration and DNA damages."

            "Value": "An in vivo investigation of the effects of dimethylarsinic acid, a primary metabolite of arsenate and arsenite, was conducted. Male ICR mice were orally dosed with sodium dimethylarsinic acid at concn of 1500 mg/kg. Following dosing the mice were sacrificed and their organs homogenized for a fluorimetric determination of DNA content. Another group of five mice were placed in metabolic cages after dosing with 1500 mg/kg sodium dimethylarsinic acid in order to determine the arsenic content in expired air. Organ assays, 12 hr after dosing was applied, revealed significant DNA breaks in the lungs, but much less in the spleen, kidney or liver. The pH dependence of these DNA breaks indicated that the DNA damage caused by dimethylarsinic acid was not the result of alkylating agents. Data from the expired air of dimethylarsinic acid dosed mice indicated that dimethylarsine was probably a major metabolite of dimethylarsinic acid. A comparison DNA breakage evaluation, involving dimethylarsinic acid and dimethylarsine, demonstrated that dimethylarsinic acid did not result in DNA breakage while dimethylarsine did. The DNA breaks observed in the lungs of dimethylarsinic acid exposed mice are the result of dimethylarsine which is metabolically generated from dimethylarsinic acid. The active oxygen produced in the lung via the reaction of dimethylarsine with molecular oxygen is probably the source of the DNA damage. This active oxygen mechanism explains the lung specific DNA breakage resulting from dimethylarsinic acid administration."

Male ICR mice were given an oral dose of 1500 mg/kg of dimethylarsinic acid after fasting for several hr. Of the pulmonary enzymes directly participating in protective reactions against active oxygen species, dimethylarsinic acid elevated superoxide-dismutase and glutathione-peroxidase activities. The elevations suggested that breaks in pulmonary DNA strands were partially if not completely due to active oxygen species, probably superoxide anion radicals, produced from molecular oxygen by undergoing one electron reduction by dimethylarsine and also by hydroxyl radicals formed through a chain reaction. Superoxide anion radicals were produced mainly in Clara and alveolar type-II cells. No histopathological changes were noted in the lungs, liver, kidneys, or spleen of these mice, but there was a significant increase in heterochromatin content in alveolar endothelial cells. Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogen was activated by dimethylarsinic acid dosing, possibly to replenish the diminished NADPH level. Glutathione-reductase was not activated, despite the reduction in glutathione. Pulmonary cell damage, particularly DNA strand scission, induced by oral dosing is partially if not completely due to active oxygen species produced in the metabolism of dimethylarsinic acid."

            "Value": "DNA damage induced by administration of dimethylarsinic acid to rats and mice was investigated. At 12 hr after administration of dimethylarsinic acid, DNA single-strand breaks were induced markedly in lung. The majority of dimethylarsine, one of the main metabolites, in the expired air was excreted within 6-18 hr after administration of dimethylarsinic acid to rats. In vitro experiments using nuclei isolated from lung of mice indicated that DNA strand breaks were caused by dimethylarsine. Furthermore, the strand breaks after exposure to dimethylarsine were reduced in the presence of catalase and/or superoxide dismutase. These results suggest that the strand breaks are induced not by dimethylarsine itself but by active oxygen, eg, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical produced both by dimethylarsine and molecular oxygen. When DNA was exposed to dimethylarsine, thiobarbituric acid reactive intermediates and cis-thymine glycol were produced. Dimethylarsine appears to induce DNA damage by the mechanism similar to the damage produced by ionizing radiation."
