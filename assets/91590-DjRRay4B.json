    "Description": "Irgarol 1051 is a diamino-1,3,5-triazine that is 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine carrying a N-tert-butyl, N'-cyclopropyl and a methylsulfanyl group at position 6. It has a role as an antifouling biocide, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is an aryl sulfide, a member of cyclopropanes and a diamino-1,3,5-triazine. It is functionally related to a 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine. It derives from a hydride of a 1,3,5-triazine.",

            "Value": "SEDIMENT: Irgarol 1051 was detected at <10-132 in sediment samples collected Sep 1993 from estuary and rivers of the Southern England coast(1). Irgarol 1051 concentrations decreased from 8 to <0.2 ng/g in sediment collected Aug 1994 to Apr 1995 from Port d'Ouchy, Lake Geneva, Switzerland(2). In sediment samples collected Apr-Nov 1996 from 3 sites in the Stockholm Archipelago, Irgarol 1051 was detected at only one site at <5-9 ng/g dry weight(3). In sediment samples collected Jul-Sep 1997 from marinas of the North and Baltic Sea, Irgarol 1051 was reported at <1.0-220 ng/g dry weight(4). Irgarol 1051 was detected at 0.01-0.11 ug/g dry weight in 6 of 27 sediment samples collected in 1998 from coastal locations of the UK(5). Irgarol 1051 was detected at <3.1-222.3 ppb in 15 sediment samples collected Oct 1998 and Jun 1999 from Blackwater Estuary, Essex, UK(6). Sediment samples collected Oct 1999 to Sep 2000 from Greek ports and marinas contained Irgarol 1051 at 3-690 ng/g dry weight in approximately 10% of the samples(7). Irgarol 1051 was detected at 0.03-3.2 ug/kg dry weight in sediment samples collected Apr 19-20, 2004 from thirteen sites along the coast of Thailand(8). Irgarol 1051 was detected at <0.04-8.2 ug/kg dry weight in samples collected in 2002 and 2003 from 8 sites in the port of Osaka, Japan(9). Sediment samples collected Jul 2004 and Sep 2005 from rivers adjacent to coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan contained Irgarol 1051 at <0.016-0.12 and <0.016-0.051 ug/kg, respectively(10). Irgarol 1051 was detected at <0.1-0.2 ug/kg dry weight in sediment core samples collected Aug 2006 to Aug 2007 from Suruga Bay, Tosa Bay and Nankai Tough, Japan(11). In 6 of 13 sediment samples collected July 2007 from Maizuru Bay, Japan, Irgarol 1051 was detected at 6.8-9.8 ug/g dry weight(12). The maximum reported concentration of Irgarol 1051 in sediment samples collected from southern California recreational marinas was 9 ng/g dry weight(13)."
