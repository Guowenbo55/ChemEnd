    "Description": "Indometacin is a member of the class of indole-3-acetic acids that is indole-3-acetic acid in which the indole ring is substituted at positions 1, 2 and 5 by p-chlorobenzoyl, methyl, and methoxy groups, respectively. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it is used in the treatment of musculoskeletal and joint disorders including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, bursitis and tendinitis. It has a role as an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an analgesic, a gout suppressant, a drug metabolite, a xenobiotic metabolite, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is a N-acylindole, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an aromatic ether and a member of indole-3-acetic acids.",

            "Value": "The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (e.g., celecoxib), appear to result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. While the precise mechanism of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of NSAIAs continues to be investigated, these effects appear to be mediated principally through inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors. This effect may be related to inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins that are believed to play a role in modulating the rate and extent of leukocyte infiltration during inflammation. Indomethacin also inhibits lysosomal enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although the mechanism has not been determined, this effect appears to depend on the nature of the stimulus and may not be related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.  It has also been postulated that indomethacin, as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, may increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) which may play a role in the inflammatory response. In supratherapeutic concentrations, indomethacin depresses the synthesis of mucopolysaccharides through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. By inhibiting cyclooxygenase, indomethacin and some other NSAIAs may also interfere with prostaglandin-mediated formation of autoantibodies that are involved in the inflammatory process."

            "Value": "This article reviews the pathogenic mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric damage, focusing on the relation between cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and various functional events. NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, at a dose that inhibits prostaglandin (PG) production, enhance gastric motility, resulting in an increase in mucosal permeability, neutrophil infiltration and oxyradical production, and eventually producing gastric lesions. These lesions are prevented by pretreatment with PGE2 and antisecretory drugs, and also via an atropine-sensitive mechanism, not related to antisecretory action. Although neither rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) nor SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor) alone damages the stomach, the combined administration of these drugs provokes gastric lesions. SC-560, but not rofecoxib, decreases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and causes gastric hypermotility and an increase in mucosal permeability. COX-2 mRNA is expressed in the stomach after administration of indomethacin and SC-560 but not rofecoxib. The up-regulation of indomethacin-induced COX-2 expression is prevented by atropine at a dose that inhibits gastric hypermotility. In addition, selective COX-2 inhibitors have deleterious influences on the stomach when COX-2 is overexpressed under various conditions, including adrenalectomy, arthritis, and Helicobacter pylori-infection. In summary, gastric hypermotility plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastric damage, and the response, causally related with PG deficiency due to COX-1 inhibition, occurs prior to other pathogenic events such as increased mucosal permeability; and the ulcerogenic properties of NSAIDs require the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2, the inhibition of COX-1 upregulates COX-2 expression in association with gastric hypermotility, and PGs produced by COX-2 counteract the deleterious effect of COX-1 inhibition."
