Assuming that the concentration of microorganisms to be constant at 1.8X10+8 organisms/l(2), the half-life for the pseudo first order biotransformation rate can be estimated as 8.4 days(SRC). In a natural water sample, the biodegradation of ronnel showed a lag period of greater than 3 days. When a natural water sample was amended with inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and traces of iron and magnesium), the lag period decreased by about 45% and of biodegradation half-life decreased to about half the value of an unamended solution(2)."
