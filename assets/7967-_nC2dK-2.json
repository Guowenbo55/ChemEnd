A 5-day 32% theoretical BOD was determined using the AFNOR T 90/103 test (screening biodegradation test) and microbes from 3 polluted surface waters(5). A 96% removal (based on COD) in a mineral salts solution was observed using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum(6). Five-day BODs of 68.2% and 62.4% of theoretical were obtained using standard and seawater dilution methods, respectively(7). In Warburg respirometer studies, 50% of theoretical BOD was observed in 20 and 50 hours using adapted and nonadapted cultures, respectively(8). Fifty percent of theoretical BOD was obtained in a 5-day test using mixed microbial cultures(2)."

            "Value": "A study was performed to investigate the degree of shrinkage of mitral cells in the rat olfactory bulb when adult male Sprague Dawley rats were continuously exposed at normal rat colony odors (control), deodorized air, or cyclohexanone for 2 months. A low concentration of cyclohexanone (8 ppm) was used, which had a recognizable odor. After 10 weeks of exposure olfactory bulbs were removed, and results showed that adult rats exposed to cyclohexanone or deodorized air had significantly smaller cells than control rats. Overall, mitral cells or animals exposed to cyclohexanone were smaller than those of animals exposed to deodorized air. The number of mitral cells per bulb did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups. Exposure of adult rats to a single predominant odor has two effects: it directly deprives many mitral cells of excitation, and (via interneurons) it reduces activity in others by inhibiting their excitatory afferents."

The maximum tolerated dose for rats was 6,500 parts per million (ppm). For female mice, the maximum tolerated dose selected was 25,000 ppm in water; for males, 13,000 ppm. An additional group of female mice was given 6,500 ppm. In rats the cyclohexanone treatment did not affect survival, even at the 6,500 ppm concentration. Many neoplasms were found in the cyclohexanone treated rats. Those that differed in incidence from the untreated controls included adenoma of the adrenal cortex in male rats at a dosage rate of 3,300 ppm. However, this is not taken to be indicative of a carcinogenic effect of cyclohexanone in F344-rats. The most significant histological findings in male mice involved proliferative lesions of the liver and lung. An increase in the incidence of malignant lymphoma in the female mice treated with 6,500 ppm cyclohexanone was noted along with increased hepatocellular neoplasms in the 6,500 ppm dose group among male mice."
