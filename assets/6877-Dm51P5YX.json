Ethyl anthranilate was tested at doses of 0.01, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 0.50, and 0.80 mg/plate in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 97, TA 98, and TA 100) in the presence and absence of rat or hamster liver S-9. Ethyl anthranilate was negative in these tests and the highest ineffective dose tested without significant toxicity in any S. typhimurium strain was 0.33 mg/plate. Total clearing of the background bacterial lawn occurred in nearly all cultures tested at doses above this level."
