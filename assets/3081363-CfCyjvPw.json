Among these compounds, fentrazamide, 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1H-tetrazole-1-carboxamide, stood out as a promising rice paddy herbicide. Fentrazamide demonstrated excellent efficacy against barnyardgrass, being applied during rice transplantation due to its prolonged residual activity in Japan and Korea. The study investigated the translocation of 14C-fentrazamide from treated roots to shoots in both rice and early watergrass. Over the course of 7 days, the translocation increased in both species, with rice exhibiting significantly higher translocation rates compared to early watergrass. The radioactivity per plant was substantially greater in rice, both in roots and shoots, while early watergrass showed higher relative percentages of absorbed radioactivity. This research indicates that fentrazamide is a systemic herbicide, demonstrating notable effectiveness in controlling barnyardgrass in paddy rice fields. ",
