    "Description": "Triflumizole is a carboxamidine resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of 4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)aniline with the oxygen of the acetyl group of N-(propoxyacetyl)imidazole. A sterol demethylation inhibitor, it is used as a fungicide for the control of powdery mildew, scab and other diseases on a variety of crops. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of imidazoles, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, a carboxamidine, an ether, a conazole fungicide and an imidazole fungicide.",

            "content": "The absorption, translocation, and metabolism of the imidazole fungicide triflumizole were studied in cucumber plants after treating leaves and fruits with [phenyl-U-14C] triflumizole. Triflumizole was rapidly broken down with a half-life of about 4 days. Autoradiography and bioassay showed that triflumizole was translocated into the treated leaf, reaching a concentration sufficient to control powdery mildew. Dissipation of 14C was slower in the treated fruit than in the treated leaf due to faster and greater absorption of 14C into the peel and flesh. The half-life of triflumizole in the treated fruit was 6 days, and the concentration of total residual 14C in the fruit was equivalent to 0.12 ppm of triflumizole 14 days after treatment. In cucumber plants, triflumizole underwent imidazole ring cleavage as the initial step of the main metabolic pathway, resulting in a N-formyl degradate that was further metabolized to a major metabolite, N-(4-chloro-2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-propoxyacetamidine (FM-6-1), followed by depropylation at the ether linkage.",
