Aerobic degradation in the field to sulfoxide and sulfotone has been reported(3). However, the observed breakdown of disulfoton in sterile and glucose-amended soil was considered to provide evidence against microbial oxidation(4). Loss of disulfoton in sterilized and unsterilized soil irradiated with sunlight for 1 week was 68-87% and 68-79%, respectively, suggesting that microbial metabolism was not responsible for the loss of disulfoton(1)."

In both R1 cells and isolated hepatocytes, distinct dose- and time-dependent morphological alterations including diminished amounts of heterochromatin, proliferation of lysosomal elements, dilation and vesiculation of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, induction of concentric membrane whorls and an increased amount of lipid droplets could be detected at concentrations of > or = 2 mg/l (R1 cells) and > or = 0.2 mg/l disulfoton (hepatocytes). Additional effects in isolated hepatocytes comprised marginalization of heterochromatin, myelin-like structures attached to mitochondrial membranes, formation of ring-shaped mitochondria, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum, induction of ring-shaped Golgi cisternae, glycogen depletion and occurrence of glycogenosomes. Structural changes in isolated hepatocytes could be correlated to suppression of lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, malic enzyme, esterase as well as glutathione S-transferase, but to a stimulation of 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and the rate of lipid peroxidation at concentrations > or = 0.01 mg/l disulfoton.

Each organophosphate was administered through the diet for 13 weeks  to separate groups of Fischer 344 rats at four dose levels, including a vehicle control. For  each study, 12 rats/sex/dietary level were tested using a functional observational battery  (FOB), automated measures of activity (figure-8 maze), and detailed clinical observations,  with half of the animals perfused at term for microscopic examination of neural and muscle  tissues. Separate groups of satellite animals (6/sex/dietary level) were used to measure the  effect of each treatment on plasma, erythrocyte (RBC), and brain cholinesterase (ChE)  activity. The results show that measures of ChE activity were consistently the most sensitive  indices of exposure and assisted in the interpretation of findings. All treatment-related  neurobehavioral findings were ascribed to cholinergic toxicity, occurring only at dietary  levels that produced more than 20% inhibition of plasma, RBC, and brain ChE activity.  Neurobehavioral tests provided no evidence of additional cumulative toxicity after 8 weeks of  treatment. The FOB and motor activity findings did not alter the conclusions and generally did  not reduce the neurobehavioral no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for any of the six compounds,  relative to the results from detailed clinical observations as conducted in these studies. The  one exception occurred with tebupirimphos, where the NOEL for motor activity was one dose  level lower than the NOEL for the FOB and clinical observations. These results support the  value of detailed clinical observations to screen for the neurotoxic potential of  organophosphates and a general standard of more than 20% inhibition of brain ChE activity for  cholinergic neurotoxicity."

Tolerance to disulfoton was due to a decr in the number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, while tolerance to propoxur appeared to be due to an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. In the present study we investigated if cross-tolerance between disulfoton and propoxur would occur. Cross-tolerance was evaluated by measuring acute toxicities, cholinesterase and carboxylesterase inhibition and hypothermic and antinociceptive effects. Mice tolerant to propoxur were cross-tolerant to the hypothermic and anticholinesterase effects of disulfoton. Similarly, when mice were pretreated with the microsomal enzyme inducer, phenobarbital, the toxicity of disulfoton was decreased. Mice made tolerant to disulfoton were cross-tolerant to the organophosphate chlorpyrifos, but were more sensitive than controls to the toxicity of propoxur. The acute toxicity of the organophosphate malathion was also increased in disulfoton-tolerant mice. Propoxur is metabolized by mixed function oxidases and possibly by a carboxylesterase. While hepatic microsomal enzymes appeared to be unchanged in disulfoton-tolerant mice, brain and liver carboxylesterase activities were significantly inhibited. Pretreatment of mice with the specific carboxylesterase inhibitor triorthotolylphosphate is known to greatly potentiate the toxicity of malathion and also potentiated, to a lesser extent, the toxicity of propoxur."

Basal and carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism were measured in cerebral cortex slices, by measuring the accumulation of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in the presence of lithium. In control animals carbachol caused a 600% increase in inositol phosphates accumulation with an EC50 of 100 uM. Maximal effect occurred with a LiCl concentration of 7.5 mM and required the presence of calcium. Administration of disulfoton for 10 days (2 mg/kg/day by gavage), decreased the number of muscarinic receptors in cortex from 1.1 to 0.7 pmol/mg of protein without changing the affinity of the receptors (both measured by binding of (3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate). Acetylcholinesterase was inhibited by 85%. Basal inositol phosphates accumulation was unchanged in disulfoton-treated rats, whereas carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphates accumulation decreased by 18%. No changes of norepinephrine-stimulated inositol phosphates formation and of alpha-1 adrenoceptors were present in cortices from disulfoton-treated rats. Recovery of muscarinic receptor binding and carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphates accumulation occurred at a similar rate and was completed 2 to 3 weeks after the end of the treatment, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity was still 38% inhibited 3 weeks later. These results support the hypothesis that a functional adaptation of muscarinic receptors is involved in the development of tolerance to organophosphates."

Binding of the specific muscarinic radioligand, (3H) quinuclidinyl benzilate ((3H) QNB) to ileal muscle, forebrain, and hindbrain from treated animals was significantly less than the amount bound to tissue from the control animals. Binding of (3H) quinuclidinyl benzilate to heart tissue from tolerant animals was not different from control values. After a typical tolerance-inducing regimen of 7 doses of 2 mg/kg/day disulfoton followed by 4 doses of 3 mg/kg/day, (3H) quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to heart from treated animals was 104% of controls, while binding to ileal muscle, forebrain, and hindbrain was 67, 69, and 77% of control values (p<0.001, 0.001 and 0.01), respectively.

OP-induced muscarinic acetylcholine receptors down-regulation in vivo is modeled by chronic in vitro exposure to muscarinic agonists. Many studies, both in vivo and in vitro, indicate that the treatment-induced decrease in muscarinic acetylcholine receptors number is accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA levels of specific muscarinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes. In this study, the in vivo effects of OP exposure on the mRNA levels of three muscarinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes (m1, m2, and m3) were examined in brain tissue and in peripheral mononuclear cells, which express the m3 subtype. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered disulfoton (2 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, and a subset of exposed animals was allowed to recover for 28 days. This treatment caused a 28% and 81% decrease, respectively, in (3H)-QNB binding and acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex, similar to that observed in previous studies; after recovery, these levels had returned to 99% and 90%, respectively, of controls. There was a significant decrease in m1 mRNA levels in hippocampus (23%) after disulfoton treatment, while no change was observed in the cortex, corpus striatum, medulla, or cerebellum. The m2 subtype mRNA was significantly decreased in both hippocampus (24%) and medulla (19%), but not in cortex, striatum, or cerebellum. m3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in cortex (10%), but no change was observed in hippocampus, medulla, cerebellum, or lymphocytes. After recovery, no differences in m1 or m3 mRNA levels were observed in any tissue examined, whereas the decrease in m2 mRNA in the hippocampus remained significant (29%). These results indicate that OP exposure can differentially regulate mRNA levels for MR subtypes in different brain areas, and suggest that m2 muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus are most affected by this treatment."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ Repeated exposures to organophosphorus insecticides has been shown to cause a decr of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in brain and in peripheral tissues. These changes are believed to be involved in the development of tolerance to organophosphorus toxicity and may play a role in cognitive dysfunctions observed following repeated organophosphorus exposure. Recently, cholinergic muscarinic receptors identified in circulating lymphocytes have been shown to be modulated similarly to brain cholinergic muscarinic receptors following repeated organophosphorus exposure, suggesting that these peripheral cells may be useful as indicators of cholinergic muscarinic receptor changes in the CNS. This study was designed to further investigate whether cholinergic muscarinic receptors on lymphocytes could serve as a biomarker for changes in brain cholinergic muscarinic receptors during prolonged organophosphorus exposure and during recovery from such exposure. Using the cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist (3)H quinuclidinyl benzilate to label cholinergic muscarinic receptors, it was found that exposure to disulfoton for 14 days (2 mg/kg/day by gavage) caused a significant decr (25-35%) in muscarinic receptors density in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, as well as in circulating lymphocytes. The decline of cholinergic muscarinic receptor density in lymphocytes paralleled those observed in brain, particularly in cortex & hippocampus, during exposure to disulfoton; however, while brain cholinergic muscarinic receptor levels recovered slowly after termination of exposure and remained significantly reduced 4 wk after the last treatment, (3)H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in lymphocytes recovered rapidly within 1 wk. Similarly, lymphocyte acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly inhibited and correlated well with brain acetylcholinesterase activity during exposure, but the recovery was rapid relative to acetylcholinesterase activity in brain."

Concurrent with the induction of tolerance, decreased sensitivity to the cholinergic agonists carbachol and oxotremorine could be demonstrated in studies of heart rate in vivo and in isolated preparations of ileum and atria. A significant decrease in the binding of the muscarinic antagonist (3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate could be demonstrated in ileum from disulfoton-tolerant animals. However, no alterations in the binding of (3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate, (3H)oxotremorine-M, or oxotremorine were evident in atria from tolerant animals.

            "content": "The penetration and translocation of vamidothion, dimethoate, disulfoton, thiometon, and mecarbam in rice plants were investigated using 32P-labeled compounds. Specifically, emulsifiable concentrates of these insecticides were applied to the soil surface of rice plants, and the penetration, translocation, and accompanying insecticidal activity were examined. The results showed that disulfoton exhibited high concentrations in the underground parts of the rice plant shortly after application, indicating rapid penetration into the underground parts. Dimethoate showed almost equal concentrations in both the above-ground and underground parts, suggesting that it can easily penetrate and translocate within the plant body. In contrast, the penetration and translocation of vamidothion were gradual, while those of thiometon and mecarbam were weak. The increase in mortality of the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) in an insecticide bioassay conducted using the same application method corresponded roughly to the increase in insecticide concentrations in the above-ground parts. At the end of the experiment (6 days after application), residues of vamidothion were low.",

Each compound was dissolved in chloroform and washed with water before being concentrated to dryness. Purity of each compound was determined by means of distribution of radioactivity in silica gel thin-layer chromatography and colorimetric determination with palladium chloride. Some compounds were further purified with thin-layer chromatography. Each compound was added to aceton:benzene:Newcoa 1863 at a ratio of 30:30:30 W/W to make a 10% emulsifiable concentration.",
