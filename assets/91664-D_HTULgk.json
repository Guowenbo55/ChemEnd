    "Description": "Tolclofos-methyl is an organic thiophosphate that is 2,6-dichloro-4-methylphenol in which the hydrogen of the hydroxy group group has been replaced by a dimethoxyphosphorothioyl group. Tolclofos-methyl is a phospholipid biosynthesis inhibitor and fungicide that is used for controlling soil-borne diseases caused by Typhula incarnata, Corticium rolfsii, Typhula ishikariensis, and Rhizoctonia solani. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is an organic thiophosphate and a dichlorobenzene.",

The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",

Our investigation focused on assessing the plants' uptake and translocation abilities of these pesticides under different growth conditions. We observed that the root concentration factor (RCF) of pesticides tended to increase with higher temperatures, although the influence of temperature on the transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) varied depending on the specific pesticide. Additionally, both RCFs and TSCFs of pesticides were notably higher under short days. Surprisingly, soil water content did not significantly impact the uptake and translocation of the pesticides. These findings underscore the importance of considering growth conditions, particularly temperature and day length, in developing accurate models for predicting plant uptake of these pesticides.",
