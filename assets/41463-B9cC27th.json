Leaf absorption of\u00a014C-pyridate was generally enhanced by the addition of 2,4-DB. Translocation of\u00a014C-pyridate out of the treated leaf did exceed 21% of the amount absorbed across all species, and\u00a014C-pyridate was not affected by the addition of 2,4-DB. Sensitivity of peanut, Florida beggarweed, and sicklepod to pyridate was independent of both adsorption and translocation. Metabolic detoxification of pyridate into a benign metabolite was highest in the tolerant peanut, lowest in highly susceptible Florida beggarweed, and intermediate in slightly susceptible sicklepod. Absorption of\u00a014C-2,4-DB by peanut was increased by approximately 10% with the addition of pyridate. No such increase was observed in either Florida beggarweed or sicklepod. Translocation of\u00a014C-2,4-DB out of the treated leaf was not affected by the addition of pyridate in any of the three species evaluated.",
