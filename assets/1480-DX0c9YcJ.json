The primary degradation product of 2,4,5-T in aqueous and soil systems is 2,4,5-trichlorophenol(3). Aerobic metabolism of 2,4,5-T leads to formation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and 3,5-dichlorocatechol which may further degrade to 4-chlorocatechol or cis,cis-2,4-dichloromuconic acid, 2-chloro-4-carboxy-methylene-but-2-enolide, chlorosuccinic acid and succinic acid(2). Degradation under anaerobic conditions has led to the formation of di- and mono-chlorophenols and 2,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid(4,5). Anaerobic degradation occurs much more slowly than aerobic degradation(6)."

            "Value": "In long-term degradation studies of massive quantities of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in test grids, field plots and herbicide storage areas were carried out. The method of herbicide application had significant impact on the amount applied per unit area and hence on residue persistence: spills > or = soil incorporation > aerial application. 2,4,5-T was more persistent in the soil than 2,4-D. The formulation of the herbicide also had significant impact on its persistence: isooctyl ester > butyl ester > acid. The addition of coconut charcoal increases persistence of the phenoxy herbicide residues, especially residues of 2,4,5-T. The appearance of dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol in soils treated with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T suggests that they are degradation products of the herbicides. A massive concn of herbicides does not sterilize the soils. Apparently, microbial populations respond both quantitatively and qualitatively to the presence of high concentrations of herbicides and may play an important role in their degradation. The contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenza-p-dioxin had a long persistence time in soils (years) and may be a major consideration in the use of soil (years) and may be a major consideration in the use of soil biodegradation as a disposal option for unwanted phenoxy herbicides or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenza-p-dioxin contaminated chemical wastes."

Exposure of cells to 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis; 50% inhibition occurred at 2.21 mM and 0.90 mM for 2,4-D & 2,4,5-T, respectively. Furthermore, strong synergistic inhibition of DNA synthesis was produced by mixtures (each having a total concentration of 1.25 mM) of 2,4-D with 2,4,5-T. Similarly, 2,4,5-T is more potent than 2,4-D in causing cytoskeletal perturbation as revealed by fluorescence microscopy. Treatment of cells with 2,4-D (2.5 mM) or 2,4,5-T (1.25 mM) for 20 hr resulted in severe MT aggregation and the appearance of large bundles, which were organized in a rope-like structure in the former and a dramatic octopus-like pattern in the latter. Further, MT bundling is particularly severe in the cell center. Under these conditions, marked changes in MF organization also occurred as evidenced by clustering and crisscrossing of MF in the perinuclear region. A 1:1 mixture (final= 1.25 mM of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, a formulation equivalent to Agent Orange composition, also induced a dramatic perturbation to the organization of MT and MF, resulting in the formation of ring-like structures. MT bundling is still apparent, especially around the outer edge of the \"rings.\" MF are localized predominantly along the cell periphery, where they appear to be aggregated tightly forming patches. Surprisingly, the synthesis and composition of cytoskeletal proteins, which are resistant to detergent extraction but released by CaCl2, are essentially unaffected by 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T. These results suggest that the dramatic perturbation of the cytoskeletal morphology caused by these herbicides probably only results from a structural reorganization and redistribution of MT and MF."

Also, their binding to proteins in rat plasma was determined in vitro by increasing the concentrations of chlorophenoxyacetic acids in the incubate from 0 to 1 mg/ml. Both 2,4-D and MCPA pretreatments increased brain concentrations of (14)C-labelled herbicides more markedly than 2,4,5-T pretreatments did. No essential differences were found in the different brain areas. Protein-unbound fractions of 2,4,-D and MCPA in the plasma were clearly higher than those of 2,4,5-T but the highest herbicide concentration increased the protein-unbound fraction of 2,4,5-T more (7-13-fold) than of 2,4-D and MCPA (5-fold). The results suggest that the greater increase in the penetration into the brain of 2,4-D and MCPA than of 2,4,5-T during their intoxication is due to some factors other than the changes in their binding to plasma proteins and mere enhanced diffusion through the blood-brain barrier."

In experiments where leaves were treated with 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T as the acid, triethanolamine salt, or 2-ethylhexyl ester formulations, absorption was found to increase with decreasing polarity of the molecule. Although the ester formulations exhibited lower relative mobility, their greater absorption resulted in greater accumulation in the roots compared to other herbicides. When dichlorprop or fenoprop formulated as the 2-ethylhexyl esters were applied, a definite effect of chemical structure was observed on both absorption and translocation. The results of these tests and their implications in the response of bigleaf maple are discussed.",
