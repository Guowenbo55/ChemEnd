            "Value": "Endeavour prawns from Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, and Groote Elylandt, Australia, contained 2,4-dibromophenol at concentrations of 58 to 200, 160, and 31 ug/kg, respectively(1). Ten different species of fish, collected in August 1992 from the eastern coast of Australia, contained 2,4-dibromophenol at concentrations of <0.05 to 2.0 ng/g for the carcass and <0.05 to 150 ng/g for the whole gut (analysis of single fish from each species)(2). Ocean fish were separated by species into pelagic carnivores, benthic carnivores, diverse omnivores and restricted omnivores; concentrations in the flesh ranged from <0.01 to 1.2 ng/g, <0.01 to 23 ng/g, <0.01 to 2.0 ng/g, and 0.2 to 0.5 ng/g, respectively, while concentrations in the gut ranged from <0.01 to 3.3 ng/g, <0.01 to 320 ng/g, 0.1 to 150 ng/g, and 2.5 to 26 ng/g, respectively(3). Thirty samples of 9 species of prawns, collected from the eastern coast of Australia from 1993 to 1996, contained 2,4-dibromophenol at concentrations of 0.20 to 1100 ng/g(4). 2,4-Dibromophenol concentrations in cultivated prawns ranged from <0.01 to 0.59 ng/g(4). 2,4-Dibromophenol was detected in marine fish, mollusks, and crustaceans obtained from a seafood shop in Hong Kong. Seasonal concentrations in the flesh of rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus) and brown-spotted grouper (Epinepheus areolatus) ranged from 0.727 to 9.47 ng/g and 0 to 5.36 ng/g, respectively; in the gut, concentrations ranged from 3.41 to 97.1 ng/g and 4.63 to 31.4 ng/g, respectively. In the mullusks, including clams (Tapes philippinarum) and oysters (Ostrea rivularis), seasonal concentrations ranged from 2.54 to 195 ng/g and 9.80 to 52.9 ng/g, respectively. For crustaceans, seasonal concentrations in the cephalothorax and tail of the shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) ranged from 1.78 to 10.4 ng/g and 0 to 6.78 ng/g, respectively; in crab (Charybdis feriatus), concentrations ranged from 27.6 to 214 ng/g(5)."
