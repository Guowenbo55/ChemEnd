    "Description": "Indaziflam is a diastereoisomeric mixture of the two fluoroethyl diastereoisomers of N-(2,6-dimethylindan-1-yl)-6-(1-fluoroethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine in which the indane moiety has 1R,2S configuration. A cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor, it is used as a pre-emergence herbicide for the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds in citrus, grapes, fruit trees, Christmas tree farms, lawns and sports fields. The two diastereoisomers have very similar biological activity; commercial material is a 95:5 mixture of the (1R,2S,fluoroethyl-R) and (1R,2S,fluoroethyl-S) diastereoisomers. It has a role as a herbicide and a cellulose synthesis inhibitor. It contains a N-[(1R,2S)-2,6-dimethyindan-1-yl]-6-[(1R)-1-fluoroethyl]-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine and a N-[(1R,2S)-2,6-dimethyindan-1-yl]-6-[(1S)-1-fluoroethyl]-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.",

Pecan trees were planted in pots with homogeneous porous media (sandy loam soil), preferential flow channels open to the soil surface, and shallow tillage at the soil surface. Pots were treated with indaziflam at two application rates of 25 and 50 g a.i./ha in 2014 and 2015. Each pecan tree was irrigated with 7 L of water every 2 weeks during the growing season. An irrigation volume of 2 L was used to maximize indaziflam retention time in the soil from Dec. 2015 until the end of the trees\u2019 dormant stage. In 2014, leachate samples were collected after each irrigation for quantifying indaziflam mobility. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0 to 12 and 12 to 24 cm after 45, 90, and 135 days of indaziflam application, and leaf samples were collected at the end of the growing season to quantify mobility and uptake. Indaziflam was detected in leachate samples, and the leaf indaziflam content increased with increasing application rate. Indaziflam and its breakdown products were detected at both sampling depths. Mass recovery and half-life values for indaziflam in the soil ranged from 38% to 68% and 63 to 99 days, respectively. No phytotoxicity effects were observed from increasing application rate and retention time of indaziflam in the soil. Most of the applied indaziflam was retained in the soil at shallow depth.",
