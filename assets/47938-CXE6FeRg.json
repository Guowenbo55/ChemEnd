            "content": "Under controlled environment growth room conditions, the EDSo values were determined for oat (Avena sativa L. cv. OAC Woodstock) and crabgrass (Digitaria ischaemum (Schreb., Muhl.)) at the three-leaf stage in response to foliar-applied fenoxaprop-ethyl. The EDSo values were found to be 58.5 and 15.8 g ai/ha for oat and crabgrass, respectively, at the three-leaf stage. For crabgrass at the three-tiller stage, the EDSo value was 11.9 g ai/ha. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Fredrick) was found to be tolerant to fenoxaprop-ethyl, so the EDSo value for wheat was not determined. When radioactively labeled [14C]fenoxaprop-ethyl was applied to the foliage, wheat, crabgrass, and oat absorbed 62%, 40%, and 35% of the applied radioactivity after 8 hours, and 84%, 84%, and 54% after 72 hours, respectively. Approximately 8%, 9%, and 3% of the applied radioactivity moved acropetally (upward) to the portion of the second leaf above the treated zone after 72 hours in wheat, oat, and crabgrass, respectively. Less than 2% of the applied radioactivity moved basipetally (downward) from the treated zone in all plant species. These results indicate that the differences in sensitivity between wheat and the sensitive species are not due to differences in the absorption or translocation of fenoxaprop-ethyl. However, the sensitivity differences between crabgrass and oat may be partially explained by differences in absorption and translocation. Metabolism studies revealed that in wheat, 62% of the recovered radioactivity was bound to insoluble constituents or converted to polar metabolites. In crabgrass and oat, these fractions accounted for only 28% and 40%, respectively. The bound and polar fractions likely represent detoxified forms of the herbicide. Oat predominantly produced metabolite A (27%), while crabgrass predominantly produced metabolite B (36%). Wheat produced small amounts of metabolites A (10%) and B (4%). Metabolite A, which is likely a glycosyl-ester conjugate, hydrolyzed to metabolite B when treated with p-glucosidase. The product of ether bond cleavage, 6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-benzoxazol-2-one, accounted for 21% to 26% of the recovered radioactivity in all three species.",

The results showed that water stress reduced the absorption and translocation of both herbicides when plants were harvested within 24 hours after application. However, the effect diminished after 48 hours. Water stress also reduced the phytotoxicity of fenoxaprop-ethyl but not imazamethabenz-methyl when applied as individual droplets.
