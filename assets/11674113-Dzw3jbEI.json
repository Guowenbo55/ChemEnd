The root uptake process involves an initial phase of rapid absorption followed by a slower and balanced phase. Accumulation of penflufen in the leaves and stems occurs gradually and maintains equilibrium. penflufen applied to the roots can be translocated to the stems and leaves, accumulating in these parts. Through leaf application on a single leaf, penflufen is quickly absorbed by the leaf and can translocate across leaves to other leaf segments, subsequently accumulating in the stems and roots. Specifically, the concentration of penflufen in the treated leaf decreases rapidly in the early stages of treatment, while it accumulates rapidly in the leaf below (the third leaf) and gradually decreases to equilibrium. The accumulation process of the pesticide in wheat plants' flag leaves, stems, and roots involves rapid uptake followed by a basic equilibrium state. penflufen applied through leaf application can translocate and accumulate between leaves, as well as translocate to the stems and roots. This demonstrates that penflufen possesses bidirectional translocation capabilities. In practical applications, it can be used for controlling both above-ground diseases through seed treatment or root application and root diseases through foliar spray on above-ground parts.",
