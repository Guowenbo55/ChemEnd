    "Description": "Strychnine is a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid that is strychnidine bearing a keto substituent at the 10-position. It has a role as an avicide, a glycine receptor antagonist, a cholinergic antagonist, a rodenticide and a neurotransmitter agent. It is a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid and an organic heteroheptacyclic compound. It is a conjugate base of a strychnine(1+). It derives from a hydride of a strychnidine.",

Moisture content was at 75% field capacity. Strychnine was added at 10 ppm and incubated at 25 \u00b0C in the dark for 56 days(1,3). After a lag of approximately 21 days, biodegradation proceeded rapidly with 97.6% and 92.3% removal after 56 days, respectively(1,3). The lag phase was attributed to combined microbial adaption and soil adsorption(1,3). Little or no degradation of strychnine at a concentration of 50 mg/kg was observed after 98 days in an acidic (pH= 5.9) Mintaro soil from South Australia(2). In contrast, >95% degradation was observed in Booleroo and Bute soils, pH of 6.72 and 7.32, respectively, from the same region(2)."

            "Value": "Strychnine is a strong convulsant. The alkaloid excites the CNS by specifically antagonizing the inhibitory neurotransmitter amino acid, glycine, at postsynaptic receptors. Inhibitory glycine receptors are abundant in the spinal cord and brain stem where they are mainly involved in regulation of motor functions. Strychnine-binding glycine receptors were also found in the cortex, as well as in the auditory and visual systems. When inhibition is blocked, ongoing neuronal excitability is increased and sensory stimuli produce exaggerated reflex effects. Glycine receptors in higher brain centers such as the substantia nigra, neostriatum, and hippocampus are commonly insensitive to strychnine, explaining why strychnine symptoms are largely spinal in origin. Strychnine can also depress nicotinic-cholinergic responses through interaction with nicotinic receptors and at high concentrations in vitro binds to other receptors as well."

            "Value": "A mean Koc of 13,823 was reported for strychnine(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that strychnine is expected to be immobile soil. The pKa of strychnine is 8.26(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). It has been suggested that strychnine is absorbed to such an extent, that no measurable amount remains in solution(5). It was concluded that strychnine soil adsorption may involve a combination of mechanisms, including surface adsorption and partitioning into the organic matter fraction, which may be pH dependent(6)."
