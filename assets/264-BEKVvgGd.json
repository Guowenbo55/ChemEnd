            "Value": "Diet, especially the amount of starch and dietary fiber which escape digestion in the small intestine are major determinants of colon function in man. These carbohydrates are the principal substrates for fermentation by the large bowel flora. Carbohydrate fermentation results in lowered caecal pH and the production of short chain fatty acids of which butyric acid may protect the colon epithelium from dysplastic change. Protein digestion and amino acid fermentation also occur in the large bowel but the nature of its endproducts varies in relation to the amount of carbohydrate available. During active carbohydrate breakdown amino acid fermentation endproducts such as ammonia are used by the bacteria for protein synthesis during microbial growth, but in carbon limited fermentation amines, ammonia, phenols and indoles, etc, accumulate. Fermentation also results in changes in colon pH which alters the metabolism of bile acids, nitrate, sulfate and other substances. Fermentation is thus controlled to a great extent by substrate availability, especially of carbohydrates which are derived from the diet. The potential to induce mutagenic change in colon epithelial cells and promote tumor growth may readily be influenced by diet."

As a product of fermentation within the human colon, it serves as the most important energy source for normal colorectal epithelium. It also promotes the differentiation of cultured malignant cells. A switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism accompanies neoplastic transformation in the colorectum. The separate functional roles for n-butyrate may reflect the different metabolic activities of normal and neoplastic tissues. Deficiency of n-butyrate, coupled to the increased energy requirements of neoplastic tissue, may promote the switch to anaerobic metabolism."

Lysosomal enzyme activity changes are associated with both normal and neoplastic growth as well as many aspects of the neoplastic process. The comparative ultrastructural results showed that the butyrate treated cells had a more extensive internal membranous system than the untreated cells, whereas other organelles seemed unaffected. The histochemical localization of lysosomal acid phosphatase showed a 2-fold increase in particulate reaction product in the butyrate-treated HeLa cells. Butyrate treatment may prevent sublethal autolysis by arresting the leakage of the lysosomal enzymes from the lysosome into the cytosol and thus allowing the cell to differentiate chemically and morphologically."

The increase in nuclear binding was not merely a reflection of the higher cellular hormone content, and Scatchard analysis of L-triiodothyronine binding to isolated nuclei revealed that butyric acid increased receptor number without changing affinity. The effect on the receptor was quantitatively important: a 48 hr incubation with 2 mM butyric acid increased nuclear binding by 2-3 fold, and 5 mM butyrate by 35 fold. Butyric acid increased receptor levels by decreasing receptor degradation, since the apparent half-life of receptor disappearance increased by approximately 3 fold in cells incubated with 2 mM butyric acid for 48 hr. Butyric acid had little effect in increasing the level of multiacetylated forms of H3 and H4 histone when studied in acid-urea gels, but it markedly inhibited the turnover of (3)H-acetate from the histone fraction. There was a striking similarity in the dose-response of butyric acid for increasing receptor levels and inhibiting histone deacetylation. Furthermore, a very close correlation between receptor levels and (3)H-acetate release was also found when different short-chain fatty acids were used."

The antiproliferative effect of sodium butyrate is accompanied by phenotypic alterations that include morphological and biochemical changes. Sodium butyrate treatment markedly enhanced the activity of the plasma membrane bound enzyme gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, implicated to participate in amino acid transport, in all 3 cell lines. The treated cells acquired a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and accumulated fat droplets. Also NADPH cytochrome c reductase, a marker enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum was markedly enhanced.

The ultrastructure of treated cells seemed more organized, with the occurrence of and extensive internal membranous system including the rough and smooth surface endoplasmic reticulum as well as the appearance of a distinct Gologi apparatus. These ultrastructural results indicate that the inhibition of growth by butyrate is not a toxic process that caused ultrastructral damage to the cell. The lysosomal enzyme increase and cessation of growth were revisable by treating the cells with a butyrate-free media. The histochemical studies showed that a number of lysosomal like structures increased with butyrate treatment and these structures were more randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the treated cells as opposed to the peripheral arrangement in untreated HeLa cells. The results suggest that butyrate treatment may be preventing sublethal autolysis arresting the leakage of the lysosome into the cytosol and thus allowing the cells to chemically and morphologically differentiate. /Sodium Butyrate/[European Chemicals Bureau; IUCLID Dataset, Butyric acid (107-92-6) (2000 CD-ROM  edition).

The increase in nuclear binding was not merely a reflection of the higher cellular hormone content, and the analysis of the T3 binding to isolated nuclei revealed that butyric acid increased receptor number without changing affinity. The effect on the receptor was quantitatively important: a 48 hr incubation with 2 nM butyric acid increased nuclear binding by 2 to 3 fold, and 5 mM butyrate by 35-fold. Butyric acid increased receptor levels by decreasing receptor degradation, since the apparent half-life of receptor disappearance increased by 3-fold in cells incubated with 2 mM butyric acid for 48 hr. Butyric acid had little effect in increasing the level of multiacetylated forms of H3 and H4 histones when studied in acid-urea gels, but it markedly inhibited the turnover of (3H)-acetate from the histone fraction.

The percent of n-butanoic acid sorbed to a kalonite or montmorillonite clay at 22 \u00b0C was 14.0% and 19.9% after 48 hours, respectively, which increased to 31.4% and 24.2%, respectively, after 144 hours(5).
