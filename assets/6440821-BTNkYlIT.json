The concentrations of DSP toxins and YTX in mussels increased with distance from the coast. The highest concentrations of YTX (574 microg YTX/100 g mussel meat) and diarrhetic toxins (349 microg OA equivalents/100 g mussel meat) were measured in May and August, respectively, at locations in the inner part of the fjord. Since concentrations of DSP toxins and YTX in mussels increased with distance from the coast, the locations for mussel farming in the Sognefjord close to the coast, seem to be preferable."

The levels of yessotoxins (YTXs) in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at the same site increased sharply by 14 May and peaked on 28 May, after which they steadily declined. No other algal species present showed a similar pattern of correspondence. Together with the recent finding that Norwegian strains of P. reticulatum produce YTXs, these results indicate that P. reticulatum causes yessotoxin (YTX) contamination of shellfish in Norway, and that only relatively low cell densities are necessary for this to occur. ... The depuration rate remained consistent over a 3-month period during which the temperature remained at 13-16 degrees C."

            "Value": "This study reports, for the first time, immunocytochemical evidence of the distribution of algal yessotoxins (YTXs) in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Immunopositivity to YTXs was found in immunocytes and in the digestive gland. With regards the gland, the positivity was mainly present in the lumen of both tubules and ducts. No YTXs were detected in the gonads, while the presence of toxins in the gills cannot be excluded. The data are supported by both HPLC analysis and functional assays."
