    "Description": "Chlormequat chloride is an organic chloride salt comprising equal numbers of chlormequat and chloride ions. A gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor, it is used as a plant growth retardant to produce plants with sturdier, thicker stalks, facilitating the havesting of ornamental flowers and cereal crops. It has a role as a plant growth retardant and an agrochemical. It is an organic chloride salt and a quaternary ammonium salt. It contains a chlormequat.",

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In soil, chlormequat chloride is rapidly degraded by microbial activity and has no influence on soil microflora or fauna(1). Half-lives in 4 soils were reported as averaging 32 days at 10 \u00b0C and 1 to 28 days at 22 \u00b0C(1). Studies with soil microorganisms indicated that chlormequat chloride breakdown occurred through oxidative processes(2). Chlormequat chloride, at an initial concentration of 282 ppm, biodegraded 18% after running a compost operation consisting of poultry and pig manure for 56 days; the high concentration may have retarded degradation(3). Based on analogy to other quaternary ammonium compounds(4), the reduction of biomass or other nutrient materials in natural water may reduce the biodegradation rate of the chlormequat chloride cation and acclimation enhances biodegradation of quaternary ammonium compounds."

            "Value": "Chlormequat chloride has been reported in the literature to act at the nicotinic receptor site of the neuromuscular junction. The test material may act as a depolarizing agent at this site, leading to muscular excitation followed by muscle weakness. Acute toxicity may lead to respiratory arrest. Acute toxicity of chlormequat chloride has also been reported to differ by species, which is likely due to sensitivity to depolarizing neuromuscular blockers."

            "Value": "The Koc of chlormequat chloride has been reported to be 203(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that chlormequat chloride is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, this compound exists as a quaternary ammonium cation and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(3). Chlormequat chloride is expected to adsorb strongly to various materials, including suspended solids in wastewater treatment facilities, sediments in rivers and lakes, suspended organics and minerals in natural water systems, clays, proteins, and microorganisms(4-6). Further, adsorption of quaternary ammonium compounds to river sediment occurs primarily by an ion-exchange mechanism(5). Monitoring studies of river water samples from Germany reported that 50% of an alkyltrimethyl quaternary ammonium compound detectable in the water column was associated with suspended solids in the water; the suspended solids in the water comprise a small fraction of the water(7)."

Three treatments were applied to the 5th leaf of the main stem at growth stage 5: (1) 14C-chlormequat chloride, (2) CYCOCEL* CL containing 14C-chlormequat chloride, and (3) CYCOCEL* CL containing 14C-imazaquin. The majority of the radioactivity absorbed (more than 85%) remained in the treated leaf. Ten days after application, 94.4% of the 14C-chlormequat was found in the treated leaf for chlormequat chloride alone, compared to 88.2% for the chlormequat chloride plus imazaquin treatment. This suggests that imazaquin increases the mobility and distribution pattern of chlormequat chloride in the plant.",
