The results showed that both compounds were transferred from the roots of tomato plants to their fruits. The concentration of oxamyl in tomato fruits reached 33.4 ppb after one day of application, increased to 123.5 ppb after 10 days, and then decreased to 51.1 ppb at the end of the 21-day experiment. On the other hand, the absorbed amount of carbofuran in tomato fruits reached 312.9 ppb after one day, increased to 1003 ppb after 10 days, and then declined to 130.1 ppb at the end of the experiment. The average recoveries of oxamyl and carbofuran from tomato fruits at various spiking levels were 82.6% and 80.2%, respectively. Oxamyl was metabolized to oximino oxamyl, with the amount of this metabolite reaching 569.5 ppb after one day, increasing to 609.9 ppb after three days, and then dropping to 184.8 ppb after 10 days before increasing again to 300.1 ppb at the end of the experiment. On the other hand, carbofuran was slightly metabolized to 3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran phenol, with the levels of 3-hydroxycarbofuran being greater than 3-ketocarbofuran phenol at all times following application. The results indicated that the translocation and persistence of carbofuran were greater than oxamyl in tomato plants.",

The results demonstrated basipetal translocation, as shown by the decrease in root galling and virus transmission caused by Longidorus elongatus. Analysis of tissues from potato plants treated with foliar applications of [14C]oxamyl indicated that only a small amount of the nematicide was translocated symplastically. Bioassays using Turbatrix aceti and Xiphinema diversicaudatum suggested that exudates from cucumber plants treated with foliar oxamyl were nematicidal, although the results varied widely. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis of the exudate showed very small amounts of the nematicide. The study concluded that basipetal translocation of oxamyl following foliar applications could provide some protection against nematodes at the root surface and possibly in the immediate rhizosphere. However, the amount of nematicidal exudate produced was unlikely to provide adequate control of nematodes in the soil mass at any distance from the plants.",

Verdc], along with translocation to emergent shoots, was measured over 24 and 48 hours. Uptake into submerged tissues of roots and stem base involved two processes: movement into the aqueous phase of cells and then partitioning onto the plant solids. This partitioning process was influenced by lipophilicity (measured by the l-octanol/water partition coefficient, Kow), resulting in higher uptake rates of more lipophilic compounds. Translocation to shoots was passive and most efficient at a log Kow of about 1.8, where the efficiency was about 40% of that of water. This optimal log Kow was similar to that observed in barley, although the translocation efficiency was slightly lower in parrot feather. Solvation parameters were used to model uptake and translocation of a set of ten compounds by barley, aiming to understand why translocation efficiency is reduced at log Kow > 1.8.",
