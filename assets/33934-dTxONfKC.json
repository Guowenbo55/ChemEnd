According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF value suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, assuming the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(3)."

After a 7 day quarantine period, breeding pairs were cohabited overnight. Gestation day 0 was determined the morning a vaginal copulation plug was found. Dams were observed daily for signs of clinical toxicity and weights were taken on gestation day 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 17. Parameters evaluated following termination included body weight, liver weight, gravid uterine weight, number of ovarian corpora lutea of pregnancy, and status of uterine implantation sites. Fetuses were weighed, examined for external abnormalities and received a visceral examination... .  Actual doses received: 0, 44, 91, 190.6, or 292.5 mg/kg based on body weights and food consumption. No dams died during gestation. Reduced maternal body weight gain was observed in the 0.10 and 0.15% treatment groups. No effects on the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites per dam, the percent pre-implantation loss, and sex ratio of live pups were observed... . The number and percent of resorptions, late fetal deaths, and dead and malformed fetuses were all increased in response to 0.1 and 0.15% treatments. Female fetal weight and the number of live fetuses per litter for both sexes were significantly reduced at 0.10 and 0.15% doses. A significant increase in both the percentage of fetuses with malformations and the percentage of malformed fetuses per litter were observed with dosing as low as 0.05%. External malformations included unilateral and bilateral open eyes, exophthalmia, exencephaly, and short, constricted, or no tail. Visceral malformations were identified in the major arteries. Noted skeletal defects included fused and branched ribs and misalignment and fused thoracic vertebral centra."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ In a two generation study, male/female Swiss CD-1 mice (20 animals/sex) were exposed daily to 0.0, 0.01,0.10, or 0.3% (approximately 0, 14, 140, or 420 mg/kg) of diisooctyl phthalate in their diet beginning 7 days pre-mating and throughout a cohabitation period for approximately 14 weeks. There were 40 (animals/sex) in the untreated control group. Reproductive function was assessed during this cohabitation period for number of litters per pair, number of live pups, sex, live births, and pup weight. Following the 14-week cohabitation, the pairs were separated during which any final litters were delivered and kept for assessment of the next generation fertility (F1). Due to an observed effect on fertility, a crossover mating study was performed to determine the affected sex. These mice were evaluated for body weight, organ weights, and sperm indices. When the F1 litters were sexually mature, they were mated with animals from different litters within the same group. The F2 litters were examined for litter size, survival, sex and pup weight. The F1 animals were then necropsied. A significant decrease in the number of litters/pair, live pups/litter, mean live pup weight and proportion of live pups was observed at 140 mg/kg/day. Exposure to 420 mg/kg/day resulted in significant infertility during the continuous breeding phase of the study which was seen in both sexes as identified via the crossover mating study. Exposure to the high dose in the crossover study also resulted in male specific effects including reduced testis, epididymis, prostate weights, percentages of motile sperm and abnormal sperm, and sperm concentration in the males. In females effects included reduced combined weight of ovaries, oviducts and uterus. Both sexes exhibited increased liver weights. The majority of high-dose male mice evidenced some degree of bilateral atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, however; no exposure related histopathology was observed in the females."
