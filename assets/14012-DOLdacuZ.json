The rank of sensitivity was the following: TA102, TA100, TA97, TA92, TA1978, TA98, TA1538 and TA1537, TA1535 being the only insensitive strain. Cr(III) compounds (chromic acetate, chromic nitrate and chromic potassium sulfate) were totally inactive with all strains. The direct mutagenicity of Cr(VI) was markedly decreased, through NADPH-requiring mechanisms, by rat-liver S9 fractions and, to a lower extent, by human lung S12 fractions, which supports the hypothesis of a metabolically regulated threshold in chromium pulmonary carcinogenicity."

            "Value": "Chromium (VI) anions can be considered to be mobile in sediments in the environment, except possibly under highly acidic conditions(1). In contrast chromium (III), the oxidation state in which chromium is present in acetic acid, chromium salt, appears to be much more strongly adsorbed to soils and sediments than chromium (VI)(1). The adsorption of chromium (III) onto soil follows the pattern typical of cationic metals and increases with increasing pH (lowering pH results in increased protonation of the adsorbent leading to fewer adsorption sites for the cationic metal) and the organic matter content of the soil and decreases when other competing (metal) cations are present(1). Certain dissolved organic ligands may also reduce the adsorption of chromium (III) to the solid phase by forming complexes which enhance the solubility of chromium (III) in the aqueous phase(1)."
