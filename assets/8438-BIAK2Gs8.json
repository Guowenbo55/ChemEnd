    "Description": "Piperonal is an arenecarbaldehyde that is 1,3-benzodioxole substituted by a formyl substituent at position 5. It has been isolated from Piper nigrum. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a fragrance and an insect repellent. It is a member of benzodioxoles and an arenecarbaldehyde.",
