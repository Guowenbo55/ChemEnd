Thirty-five days following the addition of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether to the water, 50% of the carbon dioxide theoretically derivable from bis(2-chloroethyl) ether was recovered. After a second addition of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether, only 9-10 days were required to observe 50% recovery of theoretical carbon dioxide, suggesting acclimation was necessary for optimal biodegradation rates(1). The absence of evidence of biodegradation in another study(2) may be attributed to an insufficiently long acclimation period (18 days)(SRC). Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether, present at 100 mg/l, reached 8.3% of its theoretical BOD in 3 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(3)."

The major organ affected was the lungs, with lesser effects in the liver, kidneys and brain. Lung damage was the cause of delayed death even after 90 minutes exposure at this concentration. Reducing the concentration to 105 ppm resulted in eventual death after 10 hours of continous exposure; however, if limited to 1 hour, no serious systemic disturbances resulted, although eye and nose irritation were evident. At 35 ppm, irritation was still present, but without other signs of adverse effects. Rats responded similarly when exposed at 250 ppm for 4 hours; this exposure was lethal."
