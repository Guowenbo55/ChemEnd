It has a role as a flavouring agent, a fragrance, an odorant receptor agonist, a plant metabolite, an EC 3.5.5.1 (nitrilase) inhibitor and an EC 3.1.1.3 (triacylglycerol lipase) inhibitor.",

Benzaldehyde has been found to occur naturally in various fruits such as peaches, black currants, strawberries, grapes, and raspberries(3). Benzaldehyde was identified in branch enclosure experiments from 66 vegetation species sampled at three US sites(4). Benzaldehyde has been reported to occur in several essential oils: hyacynth, citronella, orris, cinnamon, sassafras, labdanum, and patschoulli(5)."

Previous studies have shown that benzaldehyde causes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat synaptosomal fractions. Benzaldehyde has also been implicated in ROS formation in the CNS of rats treated with toluene. We have found that benzaldehyde effectively inactivates the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (Ki approximately 15 uM), but has no effect on the other antioxidant enzymes tested: catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase. This effect has been found to be specific to benzaldehyde since other structurally related and unrelated aldehydes tested were found to be devoid of inactivating capacity toward glutathione peroxidase. Since glutathione peroxidase is the main enzyme responsible for removal of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides in brain, its inactivation by benzaldehyde may be a main contributor to the observed ROS formation and the observed neurotoxicity caused by either benzaldehyde or toluene exposure."

The treatment of HeLa cells with nontoxic concentration (1x10-4 mM) at 42 and 43 \u00b0C for up to 3 hr induced enhancement of cell killing. The enhancement of cell killing increased as the time and concentration of BA treatment were increased at elevated temperature."
