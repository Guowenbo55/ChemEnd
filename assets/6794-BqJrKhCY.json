            "Value": "Diquat dibromide is listed as being a chemical which is unlikely to be removed during biological sewage treatment, even after prolonged exposure of the microorganisms(1). However microorganisms are capable of degrading diquat dibromide(2) and biodegradation occurs in various sediment-water systems as is evidenced by the cumulative production of CO2 in these systems(3); the rate of degradation is very slow. After 65 days, only 0.88 and 0.21% of the diquat dromide was converted to CO2 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using water and sediment from a eutrophic lake and negligible using water and sediment from an oligotrophic lake(3). Diquat dibromide adsorbed on the internal faces of montmorillonite clay in aqueous soil-nutrient solution was not degraded by microorganisms over a one year period(4). When adsorbed in the interlayer spacings of the clay, the compound probably persists indefinitely in its original form, although in a biologically inactive state(4)."

            "Value": "... acute diquat (1,1'-ethylene,   2,2'-bipyridilium)   toxicity in the rat is associated with stimulation of net fluid secretion  into the   gastrointestinal tract. ...The possibility that the mechanism of diquat  toxicity in  the   small intestine involves redox cycling of the bipyridyl leading to a disturbance of    biochemical function and oxidative stress /was examined/. Experiments performed in vitro     showed that diquat (10 uM to 1 mM) produced an incr in activity of the pentose  phosphate    pathway in rat small intestinal tissue slices, suggesting that there was oxidation  of NADPH    even at concns of diquat which do not cause intestinal fluid secretion in anesthetized rats.    When the effect of diquat on pentose phosphate activity was measured in  rats in situ at a    dose which causes maximal fluid secretion [50 mM diquat dibromide (DQBr2)],  production of    14CO2 from [1-14C]-glucose increased by 278 +/- 28% (N=4) within 1 hr of  exposure to diquat.   Under these same conditions, the tissue content of NADPH in the proximal  small intestine was  significantly depleted  ... . It is likely that  NADPH oxidation at low diquat concns can be  adequately compensated for by mechanisms  within  the tissue which protect against oxidative  stress. However, the data also suggest  that   diquat-induced fluid secretion in the rat small  intestine is associated with redox  cycling of  bipyridyl leading to depletion of NADPH."

Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(2), the Koc for diquat dibromide can be estimated to be 2,000(SRC). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that diquat dibromide is expected to have slight mobility in soil. The Rf value, from thin-layer chromatography on soil plates, for this compound falls in the range of 0-0.09, which indicates no mobility(4). Diquat dibromide is an organic divalent cation(5) and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(6)."

            "Value": "Diquat dibromide dissolves and dissociates in aqueous solution to form cations. They are highly soluble and behave as strong electrolytes even under acid conditions. Thus, their hydrophobic-hydrophilic interaction and dissociation constants do not affect their adsorption characteristics(1). Diquat dibromide is strongly adsorbed by humic substances by an ion exchange mechanism, the reaction being accompanied by a release of hydrogen ions(1). There is also evidence that charge-transfer complexes are formed between the humic acid and the bipyridylium cation(1). The relative importance of the two mechanisms is a matter of speculation(1). Diquat dibromide was in the lowest of 5 mobility categories in soil mobility measurements on 14 montmorillonite and non-montmorillonite soils(2,4). Its mobility was not correlated with any soil properties except for clay content in the case of montmorillonite soils(2). X-ray studies reveal that the diquat dibromide is tightly adsorbed to the interlayer spacings of montmorillonite making it unavailable to microorganisms(3). Adsorption by kalolinite and vermiculite is less strong and the availability of the diquat dibromide wasn't reduced completely(3). Diquat dibromide is completely adsorbed by bentonite at pH 4.1 and 8.2 and strongly adsorbed by muck at pH 3.2 and 5.3(5)."

The translocation occurs initially in the apical direction and subsequently in the basipetal direction within the plant. The extent of this translocation is found to be concentration-dependent. In a hydroponic setting, diquat dibromide formed crystalline deposits on the leaf surface of Galinsoga parviflora, and all concentrations (ranging from 40% to 0.078%) exhibited lethal effects on the plants. The novel discovery of diquat dibromide's systemic characteristics, shedding light on its ability to move within plants."
