Cytochromes P-450b + e were induced 20- to 35-fold, but no increase was observed in cytochrome P-450c. Considerably smaller effects were obtained on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, microsomal epoxide hydrolase and microsomal cytochrome b5 content, and there was no effect on cytosolic glutathione transferase activity, under the same conditions. A dramatic increase in cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation and total mitochondrial protein, together with smaller increases in total catalase and cytochrome oxidase activities, were observed after treatment with di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate, indicating that this compound causes proliferation of both peroxisomes and mitochondria."

Carnitine acetyltransferase in the liver was increased about 100-fold by administration of DEHP. The results of in vivo experiments showed that the incorporation of L-[4,5-3H]leucine into the enzyme was 12-fold higher and the half-life of the labeled enzyme was elongated by a factor 4.6. The results of in vitro translation experiments with total hepatic RNA in a rabbit reticulocytelysate system and the results concerning the synthesis of the enzyme in isolated hepatocytes indicate that the translatable mRNA for the enzyme was increased upon administration of DEHP and that the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor (Mw = 69,000) larger than the mature enzyme (Mw = 67,500). RNA in the free polysomes directed the synthesis of the enzyme precursor five times more actively than RNA in membrane-bound polysomes."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate can be estimated to be 1.7X10+4(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate is expected to be immobile in soil. The estimated pKa of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate is 1.47(3), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon than their neutral counterparts(4). The sorption of organophosphorus compounds in soil depends on both organic matter and clay content of soil and the sorption increases as the pH of soil decreases(5). In a study on the sorption of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate on kaolinite and amectite, the acidic phosphoric group reacted rapidly and almost irreversibly with the surface cations of the clay mineral structure(5)."
