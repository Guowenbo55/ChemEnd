A thiocarbamate herbicide not approved for use in the U.S. or European Union, it is used control grass weeds in rice paddies. It has a role as an antispermatogenic agent, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a member of azepanes and a monothiocarbamic ester.",

Over an 80-day incubation period, molinate degraded much more rapidly in three non-sterile Japanese soils as compared to sterile soils(2); in the non-sterile soils, >90% of initial molinate degraded while only 10-20% degraded in the sterile controls under upland conditions(2); degradation was slower (20-70%) in flooded soils(2); half-lives were 8-25 days under upland conditions and about 40-160 days under flooded conditions(2). Degradation of molinate in a non-sterile perfusion soil system was shown to be faster than in a sterile control system(3). A half-life in soil of 21 days has been reported using soils from the vicinity of the River Po, Italy(5). Molinate at a concn of 1.2 mg/l was degraded 50% in 30 days and 81% to 19% in 60 days in lake water from the Albufera in Valencia, Spain which was illuminated and aerated(4); the compound was degraded 96% in 30 days and to 96% in 60 days in redistilled water under the same conditions(4)."

The US Dept of Agric's Pesticide Properties Database reports a molinate Koc value of 190(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these measured Koc values suggest that molinate is expected to have high mobility in soil. Molinate readily leaches in mineral soils, slightly more than EPTC(7). In lysimeter leaching studies using a mineral alluvial soil and a humic volcanic ash soil, molinate leached more rapidly than simetryne, thiobencarb and chlornitrofen(4). In soil column leaching studies, molinate leached more readily than other thiocarbamate herbicides (EPTC, vernolate, pebulate, R-2063)(5); very little of the molinate applied to the surface remained in the upper 3 inches of soil columns(5). Molinate was observed to have high mobility in a chernozem soil(6)."

Results showed that molinate was absorbed through the roots and basal parts of shoots in both plants, with barnyardgrass absorbing greater amounts than rice plants. When absorbed through roots, radioactivity was translocated into whole plants, moving acropetally in rice plants and both acropetally and basepetally in barnyardgrass. Various organo-extractable metabolites of molinate were identified, including sulfoxide and oxo-derivatives, among others. Degradation of molinate was faster in barnyardgrass, and conjugates derived from basic metabolites were more prevalent in barnyardgrass compared to rice plants. The study suggested that differences in metabolic products and translocation direction of molinate may contribute to herbicidal selectivity between rice plants and barnyardgrass.",
