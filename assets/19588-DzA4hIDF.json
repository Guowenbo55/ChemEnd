    "Description": "Fenobucarb is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of 2-sec-butylphenol with methylcarbamic acid. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an agrochemical, a herbicide, an insecticide and an environmental contaminant. It is functionally related to a methylcarbamic acid and a 2-sec-butylphenol.",

The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",
