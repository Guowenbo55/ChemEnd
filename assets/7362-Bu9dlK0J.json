In river die-away studies using water taken from the Great Miami, Little Miami, and Ohio Rivers, 1.0 ppm of furfural was completely degraded within 3 days under aerobic conditions(2). The rate of degradation at a higher initial furfural concentration was found to be dependent upon the degree of acclimation, and fully acclimated seeds were round to degrade 25 ppm furfural within 5-12 days(2). At initial concentrations of 1.7-20 and 440 ppm, furfural underwent 46% and 17% theoretical BOD, respectively, in 5 days using a sewage sludge seed under aerobic conditions(3). Furfural at an initial concentration of 300 mg/L, in solution with phenol and N-methyl-2-pyrolidine, was found to undergo 98% removal in a flow-through laboratory bioreactor using an activated sludge inoculum under aerobic conditions(4). At an initial feed concentration of 1,000 mg/L, degradation was also found to occur(4). Furfural at an initial concentration of 200 mg/L COD underwent 96.3% removal in less than 120 hours using a thickened adapted activated sludge under aerobic conditions (5). Furfural was shown to support the aerobic growth of organisms obtained from soil and grown on phenol(6)."

Grossly and histologically all livers of experimental animals showed formation of multiple hyperplasic nodules with atypical features in parts. These hyperplastic nodules were positively immunostained with alpha-fetoprotein. On the other hand, none of the livers of 16 rats fed with furfural alone showed formation of hyperplastic changes and only 2 livers of 16 rats fed 2-FAA without preadministration of furfural showed one small hyperplastic nodule each, respectively. These results indicate that the cirrhotic liver induced by chronic furfural feeding has an enhancing effect on 2-FAA chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, and suggests that the presence of hepatic cirrhosis induces increased susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenic stimuli."

Controls received vehicle (corn oil) or were exposed to clean air. Daily oral treatment with the highest dose of furfural (initially 192 mg/kg bw/day, later reduced to 144 mg/kg bw/day and finally to 120 mg/kg bw/day) resulted in mortality, and in increases in absolute and relative kidney and liver weight in surviving females of this group. Exposure of rats by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 28 days induced mortality at concentrations of 640 mg/cu m and above within 1-8 days. At 640 mg/cu m (3 hr/day) and at 320 mg/cu m (3 and 6 hr/day) and below, however, exposure was tolerated without serious clinical effects. In contrast, histopathological nasal changes were seen even at the lowest concentration of 20 mg/cu m. With increasing exposure concentration, the nasal effects increased in incidence and severity and also expanded from the anterior part to the posterior part, including the olfactory epithelium. It was concluded that the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for oral toxicity was 96 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for systemic inhalation toxicity was comparable, i.e. 92 mg/kg bw/day (corresponding to 320 mg/cu m (6 hr/day) or 640 mg/cu m (3 hr/day)) assuming 100% absorption. The presence of the histopathological nasal changes at the lowest tested concentration of 20 mg/cu m (corresponding to 6 mg/kg bw/day) proves that for locally acting substances like furfural extrapolation from the oral to the inhalation route is not valid."

Preliminary toxicity studies established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of furfural to be 320 and 50 mg/kg in the mouse and rat, respectively. Furfural was dosed by gavage at levels of 0 (control), 50, 175 and 320 mg/kg to male and female mice and 0, 5, 16.7 and 50 mg/kg to male rats. Hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion either 2-4 hr or 12-16 hr after treatment, cultured in medium containing [3H]thymidine for 4 hr and assessed for UDS by grain counting of autoradiographs. Furfural treatment did not produce any statistically significant increase or any dose-related effects on UDS in mouse and rat hepatocytes either 2-4 hr or 12-16 hr after dosing. In contrast, UDS was markedly induced in mice and rats 2-4 hr after treatment with 20 mg/kg dimethylnitrosamine and 12-16 hr after treatment of mice and rats with 200 mg/kg o-aminoazotoluene and 50 mg/kg 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), respectively. Precision-cut human liver slices from four donors were cultured for 24 hr in medium containing [3H]thymidine and 0-10 mM furfural. Small increases in the net grain count (i.e. nuclear grain count less mean cytoplasmic grain count) observed with 2-10 mM furfural were not due to any increase in the nuclear grain count. Rather, it was the result of concentration-dependent decreases in the mean cytoplasmic grain counts and to a lesser extent in nuclear grain counts, due to furfural-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, marked increases in UDS (both net grain and nuclear grain counts) were observed in human liver slices treated with 0.02 and 0.05 mM 2-AAF, 0.002 and 0.02 mM aflatoxin B(1) and 0.005 and 0.05 mM 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. This study demonstrates that furfural does not induce UDS in the hepatocytes of male and female B6C3F(1) mice and male F344 rats after oral treatment at doses up to the MTDs. Moreover, human liver slice studies suggest that furfural is also not a genotoxic agent in human liver."

The pyrolysates were levoglucosan (LG-I), levoglucosenone (LG-II), furfural (FF), 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural (HMF), glyoxal (GL), methylglyoxal (MGL), 3-deoxy-D-glucosone (DG) and thiazolidine (TZ). The total initiating doses were 200 mumol for LG-I and DG, 25 mumol for LG-II and 500 umol for FF, HMF, GL, MGL and TZ. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) was used as a positive control agent applied to a total dose of 100 ug. All compounds were topically administered to the dorsal skin twice weekly for 5 weeks with or without TPA treatment for the following 47 weeks. In conjunction with promotion TZ induced skin tumors in 40% of the mice (average 0.65 tumors/mouse), FF in 25% (0.40/mouse), LG-I in 25% (0.35/mouse) and LG-II, HMF, DG and GL in 10-20% (0.11-0.25/mouse) respectively whereas DMBA induced skin tumors in 100% of the animals (6.7/mouse). MGL did not induce any tumors during the experiment and no tumors appeared in any of the groups treated with test chemicals alone. As assessed by Fisher's exact test, tumor incidences were significant in the TZ (0.01 less than P less than 0.05) and DMBA (P<0.01) groups as compared with the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) followed by TPA groups (5%, 0.05/mouse). Statistical analyses with Peto's trend test revealed significant tumor development in the LG-I (P<0.01), LG-II (0.05<P<0.01), FF (0.01<P<0.05) and TZ (P<0.01) followed by TPA groups (compared with DMSO + TPA). The results indicate that LG-I, LG-II, FF and TZ potentially possess tumor initiating activity, while HMF, GL, MGL and DG do not, as judged by the statistical analysis based on the incidences and development of the skin papillomas and/or carcinomas. A positive correlation between tumor initiating potential and clastogenic activity based on calculated ID50 (50% initiating dose) and published CD20 (20% clastogenic dose) values was evident for LG-II, FF and TZ, while LG-I was an exception."

Feeding of 6-MP at 50 p.p.m. for 20 weeks to animals with pre-existing liver cirrhosis caused immunosuppression, and significantly enhanced the induction of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive foci and nodules in the CCl4 but not furfural case. Glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P)-positive preneoplastic lesions were not affected. Moreover, phenobarbital (PB) also enhanced the induction of GGT-positive hepatocellular lesions only in the CCl4-induced liver cirrhosis model, no promotion influence being exerted after treatment with the non-carcinogenic furfural. This study, therefore, suggests that 6-MP can enhance the induction of one type of preneoplastic foci and nodules and that essential differences exist between focal lesions arising in cirrhotic livers caused by CCl4 as opposed to furfural."

This concentration is about 22% of the acute LC50 dose. Exposure to furfural increased the activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, inhibited the activities of arginase and succinic dehydrogenases and elevated the concentration of lactic acid in the lungs. In the group of mixed-function oxidases, the activities of aminopyrene-N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase (phase I, cytochrome P-450b specific) significantly increased and the activity of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (phase I, cytochrome P-450c specific) decreased. The activity of glutathione-S-transferase (phase II component) also was increased concurrently with a decrease in the concentration of glutathione. The magnitude of biochemical alterations in most cases was related directly to the duration of exposure. Our observations indicate that furfural caused pulmonary irritation, parenchymal injury and the regenerative proliferation of type II pneumocytes. Selective (cellular and/or cytochrome P-450 isozyme specific) enhancement of pulmonary mixed-function oxidases by furfural appears to stimulate its own pulmonary biotransformation, and the excretion of oxidative metabolites was facilitated by their enzymatic conjugation with glutathione."

Male albino-rats were exposed once to 95 ppm furfural vapor for 1 hour or to 38 ppm furfural 1 hour/day, 5 days/week for 7, 15, or 30 days. Selected rats were killed at various times up to 4 weeks post exposure and the lungs were removed. Some lungs were assayed for alkaline-phosphatase (ALP), acid-phosphatase (ACP), glutamic-pyruvic-transaminase (GPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (GOT), arginase, and total and nonprotein sulfhydryls. Other lungs were examined for histopathological changes. All furfural exposures caused yellowish discoloration of the fur, eye and nose irritation, lacrimation, perinasal and perioral wetness, and respiratory difficulty. Some rats had mild nasal bleeding and corneal opacification which disappeared after exposure was ended. The repeat exposures caused some mortality. Dead animals had enlarged and congested lungs. The single furfural exposure caused mild congestion in the blood vessels around the bronchioles and intraalveolar capillaries. Edematous fluid containing mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells was present in perivascular areas. Repeat exposure caused similar changes that progressively worsened with increasing number of exposures. ALP activity was significantly elevated by all furfural exposures at all time points. ACP activity was not affected. GPT activity was significantly increased 2 to 4 weeks post exposure. GOT activity was significantly decreased for up to 4 weeks post exposure. Furfural caused persistent decreases in arginase activity at all time points, the most pronounced decreases occurring 2 to 4 weeks post exposure. Total and nonprotein sulfhydryl concentrations were significantly decreased. The magnitude of the decreases increased with increasing number of furfural exposures."

Alkaline unwinding experiments showed that formation of an increasing number of strand breaks in duplex DNA both with increasing furfural concentrations (DNA base pair/furfural molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16) and with time of reaction (up to 16 hours). At a molar ratio of 1:16 and alkaline unwinding time of 30 min, there were 5.56 breaks per unit DNA. Number of breaks per DNA increased from 1.31 at 1 hr to 29.74 at 16 hr during incubation at a fixed DNA base pair/furfural molar ratio of 1:4 at 37 \u00b0C. Treatment of lambda phase DNA with furfural protected cleavage with restriction endonucleases DraI and SspI but not with ApaI, BssHII and SacII. To define the minimum number of consecutive AT base pairs necessary for the reaction with furfural, the reacted DNA was cleaved with the following restriction enzymes: SspI, EcoRI, NcoI, and MluI. SspI and EcoRI sites were protected against cleavage by these enzymes, but NcoI and MluI showed normal cleavage patterns. These results indicate that the reaction of furfural with double-stranded DNA requires the presence of at least 3-4 consecutive AT base pairs. When DNA was treated with furfural (molar ratio of 1:4, 37 \u00b0C for 2 hr), in the presence of sodium chloride, the number of strand breaks per unit DNA were 4.28 with furfural alone, 2.32 with furfural and 0.1 M sodium chloride, and 1.82 with furfural and 0.2 M sodium chloride."
