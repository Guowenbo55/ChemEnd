    "Description": "2,6-dibromophenol is a dibromophenol that is phenol in which both of the hydrogens that are ortho to the phenolic hydroxy group have been replaced by bromines. It has a role as a marine metabolite. It is a bromohydrocarbon and a dibromophenol. It is functionally related to a 1,3-dibromobenzene.",

            "Value": "Endeavour prawns from Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, and Groote Elylandt, Australia, contained 2,6-dibromophenol at concentrations of 99 to 250, 41, and 14 ug/kg, respectively(1). Ten different species of fish, collected in August 1992 from the eastern coast of Australia, contained 2,6-dibromophenol at concentrations of <0.05 to 0.6 ng/g for the carcass and <0.05 to 18 ng/g for the whole gut (analysis of single fish from each species)(2). Ocean fish were separated by species into pelagic carnivores, benthic carnivores, diverse omnivores and restricted omnivores; concentrations in the flesh ranged from <0.01 to 0.1 ng/g, <0.01 to 0.6 ng/g, <0.01 to 0.6 ng/g, and 0.2 to 0.3 ng/g, respectively, while concentrations in the gut ranged from <0.01 to 10 ng/g, <0.01 to 5.8 ng/g, <0.01 to 18 ng/g, and 2.2 to 5.3 ng/g, respectively(3). Thirty samples of 9 species of prawns, collected from the eastern coast of Australia from 1993 to 1996, contained 2,6-dibromophenol at concentrations of <0.01 to 34 ng/g(4). 2,6-Dibromophenol concentrations in cultivated prawns ranged from <0.01 to 1.0 ng/g(4). 2,6-Dibromophenol was detected in marine fish, mollusks, and crustaceans obtained from a seafood shop in Hong Kong. Seasonal concentrations in the flesh of rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus) and brown-spotted grouper (Epinepheus areolatus) ranged from 0.136 to 3.52 ng/g and 0 to 2.62 ng/g, respectively; in the gut, concentrations ranged from 0.293 to 15.3 ng/g and 0 to 10.5 ng/g, respectively. In the mullusks, including clams (Tapes philippinarum) and oysters (Ostrea rivularis), seasonal concentrations ranged from 0.146 to 11.9 ng/g and 0.345 to 2.18 ng/g, respectively. For crustaceans, seasonal concentrations in the cephalothorax and tail of the shrimp (Penaeus japonicus)) ranged from 0.431 to 14.4 ng/g and 0 to 6.09 ng/g, respectively; in crab (Charybdis feriatus), concentrations ranged from 2.31 to 77.3 ng/g(5)."
