Investigating its impact on 181 isolates from various crops, benzovindiflupyr showcased consistent effectiveness across different crop types. It significantly inhibited the growth and reproduction of S. sclerotiorum, demonstrating its potential as a control measure. Importantly, in eggplant leaves, benzovindiflupyr exhibited remarkable systemic translocation, especially at concentrations of 100 \u03bcg/ml, with higher efficacy in both transverse and cross-layer activity compared to acropetal and basipetal treatments. This indicates its superior movement within the leaves, showcasing its potential for systemic control against the pathogen. Notably, benzovindiflupyr\u2019s systemic translocation performance outperformed dimethachlon, underscoring its promising systemic action against Sclerotinia stem rot. These findings suggest benzovindiflupyr as a promising alternative for managing this destructive plant disease due to its robust systemic translocation ability.",
