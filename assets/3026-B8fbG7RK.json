    "Description": "Dibutyl phthalate is a phthalate ester that is the diester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy groups of phthalic acid with two molecules of butan-1-ol. Although used extensively as a plasticiser, it is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that poses a risk to humans. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a teratogenic agent, a plasticiser, a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor. It is a phthalate ester and a diester. It is functionally related to a butan-1-ol.",

            "Value": "One proposed mechanism of /testicular/ toxicity involves a disturbance in the interaction between germ cells and Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cell-germ cell interaction is generally considered to be required for the differentiation of male germ cells and their progression through the seminiferous epithelium and release as mature spermatozoa. Exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate is associated with both the release of iron from hemoglobin and/or transferrin in the liver and spleen, and the subsequent depletion of iron in the blood and testes. The decreased amount of available iron results in a decrease in succinate dehydrogenase activity in the Sertoli cells, resulting in disturbances in the energy transfer system between Sertoli cells and germ cells; anoxia due to iron depletion and/or disturbances in the energy supply may induce the sloughing of germ cells. Decreases in testicular sorbitol, fructose, and glucose levels have been observed in the testes 3-12 hours post exposure. Two days after exposure, there were significant decreases in sorbitol dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities and decreases in testicular iron and zinc levels."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ We investigated the relationship between dibutyl phthalate (DBP)-induced hypomethylation of the c-Myc promoter region (as evident in our early study) and the expression of c-Myc and DNMT1 genes (at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level) in the rat liver. Male Wistar rats received DBP in 1, 3, or 14 daily doses of 1800 mg kg-1 body weight. Levels of DNMT1, c-Myc mRNA, and proteins were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Our findings indicate that DBP caused an increase in mRNA levels of c-Myc at all time points. The results showed that protein levels of c-Myc in rat liver also increased significantly by DBP treatment, which were more pronounced at last time point (after 14 doses). Furthermore, overexpression of DNMT1gene have been found after one dose of DBP, which was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis. Reduced levels of DNMT1 mRNA and proteins (3 and 14 doses) were coordinated with depletion DNA synthesis (reported previously). Based on our previous results and those presented here, the following conclusion could be drawn: (1) DBP exerted biological activity through epigenetic modulation of c-Myc gene expression; (2) it seems possible that DBP-induced active demethylation of c-Myc gene through mechanism(s) linked to generation of reactive oxygen species by activated c-Myc; and (3) control of DNA replication was not directly dependent on c-Myc transcriptional activity and we attribute this finding to DNMT1gene expression which was tightly coordinated with DNA synthesis."

On the 20th day, all rats were sacrificed and the uterine horns and ovaries were surgically exposed to permit counting and recording of the number of corpora lutea, resorption sites, and viable and dead fetuses. Additionally, both viable and nonviable fetuses were excised, weighed, and examined for gross malformation. Thirty to fifty percent of the fetuses (using those which showed no gross malformation when possible) were prepared as transparent specimens to permit visualization of skeletal deformities. All of the esters produced gross or skeletal abnormalities which were dose related. The most common gross abnormalities in the treated animals were absence of tail, anophthalmia, twisted hands and legs, and hematomas. Skeletal abnormalities included elongated and fused ribs (bilateral and unilateral), absence of tail bones, abnormal or incomplete skull bones, and incomplete or missing leg bones. Dead fetuses were found in the groups treated with dimethyl, dimethoxyethyl, and diisobutyl phthalates. The most embryotoxic agent in the series was dimethoxyethyl phthalate. Each of the esters also reduced the weight of the fetuses when compared to the controls.

Another group of only males received 1,000 mg/kg bw. When the P0 animals were mated, treated animals were paired with untreated controls. F1 animals were not treated. After puberty F1 animals were selected (16/sex/group) for fertility assessment under continuous mating conditions over 11 breeding cycles. In the P0 generation delayed puberty (preputial separation) was seen in males at all dose-levels. DBP treatment did not accelerate the age at vaginal opening or induce persistent vaginal cornification, effects indicative of subchronic estrogen exposure. The P0 generation showed reduced fertility in male and female animals at 500 and 1,000 (males only) mg/kg bw. Infertility in males was related to testicular atrophy and reduced sperm production, while treated females cycled and mated sucessfully, but many treated females (500 mg/kg bw) aborted their litters around midpregnancy. In the F1 offspring which were exposed only in utero and lactational via dams (data only from F1 animals from dams treated with 0, 250 and 500 mg DBP/kg bw), urogenital malformations/abnormalities including a low incidence of agenesis of the epididymis, hypospadias, ectopic testis, renal agenesis and uterine abnormalities (partial agenesis or lack of implants in one uterine horn) were seen.

Zinc and testosterone levels were measured in sera and testes of all males. An increase in serum albumin was observed in exposed males at 176 mg/kg bw/day, the lowest dose tested. No other effects were seen in either sex at this dose. Adverse effects in males seen at the next highest dose (359 mg/kg bw/day) were evidenced by a decrease in hemoglobin and erythrocyte counts. Severity of the hematological effects, seen only in males, progressed in a dose-response manner at all other doses. Platelets and serum albumin were increased, as were liver and kidney organ to body weight ratios. An increase in PCoA (copper resistance protein) activity was seen in both sexes, and an increase in bile acid was seen in females. Decreases in body weight occurred in males at the 720 mg/kg bw/day dose, the third highest out of 5 treatment levels. Males exposed to 359 mg/kg bw/day and males and females exposed to 712-720 mg/kg bw/day had increased liver and kidney organ to body weight ratios. Hepatic lesions in males and females and testicular lesions were first noted at 712-720 mg/kg bw/day. Testicular lesions consisted of focal seminiferous tubule atrophy in 4/10 males. The chemistry changes noted at the next lower dose (356-359 mg/kg bw/day) continued at this dose (712-720 mg/kg bw/day) with the addition of increases in alkaline phosphatase activity. The histologic hepatic lesions persisted and testicular lesions increased in severity at the higher doses with all males of that dose group affected. Hypospermia of the epididymis was observed at the two highest doses. Decreases in testicular organ weight ratios, testicular zinc, and testosterone were not observed until the 1,540 (M) mg/kg bw/day exposure level. Peroxisome proliferation was noted histologically at the highest dose tested (2,964 [M] and 2,963 [F] mg/kg bw/day). Good dose-response data was available for almost all parameters in this study.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critical during early teleost development for establishing the dorsal-ventral axis. Within this pathway, GSK-3beta, a key regulatory kinase in the Wnt pathway, regulates beta-catenin degradation and thus the ability of beta-catenin to enter nuclei, where it can activate expression of genes that have been linked to the specification of the dorsal-ventral axis. In this study, we describe the morphological abnormalities that resulted in zebrafish embryos when axis determination was disrupted by environmental contaminants. These abnormalities were linked to abnormal nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the developmental abnormalities and altered nuclear beta-catenin accumulation occurred when embryos were exposed to commercial GSK-3beta inhibitors. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to commercially available GSK-3 inhibitors (GSK-3 Inhibitor IX and 1-azakenpaullone), or common environmental contaminants (dibutyl phthalate or the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene and fluorene) from the 2 to 8-cell stage through the mid-blastula transition (MBT). These embryos displayed morphological abnormalities at 12.5 h post-fertilization (hpf) that were comparable to embryos exposed to lithium chloride (LiCl) (300 mM LiCl for 10 min, prior to the MBT), a classic disruptor of embryonic axis determination. Whole-mount immunolabeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to localize beta-catenin. The commercial GSK-3 Inhibitors as well as LiCl, dibutyl phthalate, fluorene and phenanthrene all induced an increase in the levels of nuclear beta-catenin throughout the embryo, indicating that the morphological abnormalities were a result of disruption of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during dorsal-ventral axis specification. The ability of environmental chemicals to directly or indirectly target GSK-3beta was assessed. Using Western blot analysis, the ability of these chemicals to affect enzymatic inhibitory phosphorylation at serine 9 on GSK-3beta was examined, but no change in the serine phosphorylation state of GSK-3beta was detected in exposed embryos. Furthermore, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dibutyl phthalate had no direct effect on the in vitro kinase activity of GSK-3beta. While developmental abnormalities resulting from these axis-disrupting contaminants were linked to beta-catenin accumulation in nuclei, the details of the disruption of this signaling pathway remain unknown. Since phenanthrene and fluorene as well as other hydrocarbons have been shown to disrupt axial development in sea urchin embryos, and since axis determination and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway are highly conserved, we propose that these environmental contaminants may impact embryo development through a similar mechanism across phyla."

In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to dibutyl phthalate (DBP; from gestational day (GD) 14.5 to postnatal day (PND) 6) or diethylstilbestrol (DES; from GD14.5 to GD16.5) during a short gestational/lactational window, and male offspring subsequently analysed for various postnatal testicular parameters. All offspring remained in good health throughout the study. Maternal xenobiotic treatment appeared to modify specific Leydig cell gene expression in male offspring, particularly during the dynamic phase of mid-puberty, with serum INSL3 concentrations showing that these compounds led to a faster attainment of peak values, and a modest acceleration of the pubertal trajectory. Part of this effect appeared to be due to a treatment-specific impact on Leydig cell proliferation during puberty for both xenobiotics.

To test this hypothesis, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray analysis to assess the DNA binding of PPARalpha, SF1, CBP, and RNA polymerase II in DBP-induced testicular maldevelopment target genes. Pathway analysis of expression array data in fetal rat testes examined at gestational day (GD) 15, 17, or 19 indicated that lipid metabolism genes regulated by SF1 and PPARalpha, respectively, were overrepresented, and the time dependency of changes to PPARalpha-regulated lipid metabolism genes correlated with DBP-mediated repression of SF1-regulated steroidogenesis genes. ChIP microarrays were used to investigate whether DBP-mediated repression of SF1-regulated genes was associated with changes in SF1 binding to genes involved in DBP-induced testicular maldevelopment. DBP treatment caused reductions in SF1 binding in CYP11a, StAR, and CYP17a. Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), regulated by SF1 but unaffected by DBP-treatment, also contained SF1-binding peaks, but DBP did not change this compared with control. GD15 and GD19 fetal testes contained PPARalpha protein-binding peaks in CYP11a, StAR, and CYP17a regulatory regions. In contrast to its repressive effect on SF1, DBP treatment caused increases in these peaks compared with control. PPAR?-binding peaks in the FSHR promoter were not detected in GD15 samples. Hence, the repressive effect of DBP on SF1-regulated steroidogenic genes correlates with inhibition of SF1-DNA binding and increased PPARalpha-DNA binding. The data indicate that PPARalpha may act as an indirect transrepressor of SF1 on steroidogenic genes in fetal rat testes in response to DBP treatment."

These neural organization or reorganization happens in hypothalamus during neonatal or prepubertal period which may be two target windows of DBP exposure. The present study was designed to determine: (1) the difference between the effects of neonatal and prepubertal DBP exposure on female pubertal timing; (2) whether kisspeptin/GPR54 expression in hypothalamus would respond to neonatal and prepubertal DBP exposure differently. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by subcutaneous injection of 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg DBP during Postnatal day (P)1-5 (neonatal) or P26-30 (prepubertal). Physiological data demonstrated that both neonatal and prepubertal DBP exposure could advance pubertal timing significantly accompanied by irregular estrous cycles but only a little gonadal impairment. Exposure-period-related difference was found significant with prepubertal exposure groups having longer estrous cycle duration, heavier at vaginal opening and having higher serum estradiol level compared with neonatal exposure groups. Molecular data showed an up-regulated trend in kisspeptin mRNA and immunoreactivity levels of hypothalamic area arcuate but a down-regulation in GPR54 mRNA expression after P1-5 DBP treatment.

Because they are structurally similar to natural estrogens, they could act as endocrine disruptors. Here, we used a DNA microarray containing estrogen responsive genes (EstrArray\u00ae) to examine gene expression profiles in MCF-7 cells treated with 10 uM butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and diisopropyl phthalate (DIP) along with the natural estrogen 17\u00df-estradiol ([E2], 10 nM). The profiles for phthalate esters and E2 were examined by correlation analysis using correlation coefficients (r-values) and cluster analysis. We found that BBP showed the highest correlation with E2 (r = 0.85), and DEP and DIP showed moderate r-values (r = 0.52 and r = 0.49, respectively). Dibutyl phthalate exhibited the lowest (but still significant) correlation with E2 (r = 0.36). Furthermore, among the pairs of chemicals, DEP-DIP and DIP-DBP showed very high correlations (r = 0.90 and r = 0.80, respectively), and the other pairs showed moderate relationships, which reflected how structurally close they are to each other. The analysis of six functional groups of genes (enzymes, signaling, proliferation, transcription, transport, and others) indicated that the genes belonging to the enzyme, transcription, and other functional groups showed common responses to phthalate esters and E2. Although the effect of BBP was similar to that of E2, the other phthalate esters showed different types of effects. These results indicate that the structure of estrogenic chemicals is strongly related to their estrogenic activity and can be evaluated by appropriate grouping of the responsive genes by focused microarray analysis."

Several studies have shown that DBP causes reproductive toxicity in rodents, but no studies have evaluated its effects on ovarian follicles. Therefore, we used a follicle culture system to evaluate the effects of DBP on antral follicle growth, cell cycle and apoptosis gene expression, cell cycle staging, atresia, and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) production. Antral follicles were isolated from adult CD-1 mice and exposed to DBP at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ug/mL for 24 or 168 hr. Follicles treated with vehicle or DBP at 1-100 ug/mL grew over time, but DBP at 1000 ug/mL significantly suppressed follicle growth. Regardless of effect on follicle growth, DBP-treated follicles had decreased mRNA for cyclins D2, E1, A2, and B1 and increased p21. Levels of the proapoptotic genes Bax, Bad, and Bok were not altered by DBP treatment, but DBP 1000 ug/mL increased levels of Bid and decreased levels of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl2. DBP-treated follicles contained significantly more cells in G(1) phase, significantly less cells in S, and exhibited a trend for fewer cells in G(2). Although DBP did not affect E(2) production and atresia at 24 hr, follicles treated with DBP had reduced levels of E(2) at 96 hr and underwent atresia at 168 hr. These data suggest that DBP targets antral follicles and alters the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis factors, causes cell cycle arrest, decreases E(2), and triggers atresia, depending on dose."

Introduction of environmental chemicals with aggravation effects may play a part in this increase. The artificial chemical productdibutyl phthalate (DBP) is used in many products used in daily life. Dermal exposure to DBP is a common (but easily neglected) exposure pattern. In this study, we examined the aggravation effect of long-term dermal exposure to DBP in a T-helper type 2 (Th2) model of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice, and sought the potential molecular mechanisms. Experimental tests were conducted after 40-day dermal exposure to saline or three concentrations of DBP and subsequent three times of sensitization with 0.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or vehicle. The results of immunological and inflammatory biomarkers (total-immunoglobulin (Ig)E and Th cytokines) as well as histopathological examination and measurement of ear swelling supported the notion that high doses of DBP may promote and aggravate atopic dermatitis. Increased expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in this mouse model suggested that TSLP might be one of the molecular mechanisms of the aggravation effect induced by DBP. Together, these results indicated that long-term dermal exposure to types of environmental toxins such as phthalates may endow an atopic predisposition in animals or humans. In addition, the high expression of TSLP in the mouse model demonstrated that TSLP might have an important role in the aggravation effect. This result could help to provide effective prevention strategies against atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD)."

Murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs) were treated with 0, 1, 5, 10, 50 or 100 uM DBP in vitro for 24 hr and then the viability of PEMs were measured by flow cytometry (FCM) and trypan blue count. To investigate the effect of DBP on the functions of PEMs, we treated the PEMs with moderate dose of DBP (0, 1, 5 or 10 uM) in vitro for 24 hr. The phenotypes, phagocytosis and cytokine production of PEMs were measured by FCM or real-time PCR. The immunogenicity and antigen presenting capacity of PEMs treated with DBP in vitro were assessed both by the mixed lymphocytereaction (MLR) in vitro assay and through the injection of exposed cells in mice by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assay. High dose of DBP (50-100 uM) showed cytotoxicity on PEMs, whereas after the treatment with moderate dose of DBP (1-10 uM) in vitro, PEMs expressed low level of CD36, CD80 and MHC-II molecules, and showed significantly decreased phagocytosis on apoptotic cells and Escherichia coli. In addition, DBP treatment exhibited a decrease in the cytokine production, immunogenicity and antigen-presenting capacity of PEMs. The present study shows the effects of DBP on macrophages, demonstrating immunogenicity and decreased antigen presentation in vitro."

Experimental evidence indicates that DBP has in utero antiandrogenic effects in the rat. However, it is unclear whether DBP has similar effects on androgen biosynthesis in human fetal testis. To address this issue, we developed a xenograft bioassay with multiple androgen-sensitive physiological endpoints, similar to the rodent Hershberger assay. Adult male athymic nude mice were castrated, and human fetal testis was xenografted into the renal subcapsular space. Hosts were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin for 4 weeks to stimulate testosterone production. During weeks 3 and 4, hosts were exposed to DBP or abiraterone acetate, a CYP17A1 inhibitor. Although abiraterone acetate (14 d, 75 mg/kg/d po) dramatically reduced testosterone and the weights of androgen-sensitive host organs, DBP (14 d, 500 mg/kg/d po) had no effect on androgenic endpoints. DBP did produce a near-significant trend toward increased multinucleated germ cells in the xenografts. Gene expression analysis showed that abiraterone decreased expression of genes related to transcription and cell differentiation while increasing expression of genes involved in epigenetic control of gene expression. DBP induced expression of oxidative stress response genes and altered expression of actin cytoskeleton genes."

An experimental log Koc of 3.05 was determined from unsaturated soil columns(3). Dibutyl phthalate had measured log Koc values of 3.05-3.06 in Typic Haplaquept type loamy, sandy soil(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these Koc values suggest that dibutyl phthalate is expected to have low mobility in soil(SRC). A mean sediment log Koc value of 3.8 was calculated from the mean dibutyl phthalate concentration in water and suspended particulate matter from Lake Yssel, The Netherlands(6)."

            "content": "In this study, we delved into the distribution of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) within different tissues of wheat cultivated in DBP-contaminated soils and assessed the activity of detoxifying enzymes, specifically cytochrome P450 (P450) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), across various growth stages of wheat. The DBP content in wheat increased proportionally with higher DBP stress concentrations in the soil, but interestingly, the DBP content in each tissue decreased as wheat growth advanced. Notably, the roots exhibited a higher DBP content than leaves and stems under identical conditions. Additionally, the order of DBP content reduction across different soil types was brown soil > fluvo-aquic soil > cinnamon soil. The study also observed variations in the content of mono-n-butyl dicarboxylate (MBP), the primary metabolite of DBP, across soil types and growth stages. The changes in P450 content and GST activities in wheat tissues mirrored the alterations in DBP and MBP content, indicating a strong involvement of P450 and GST in DBP metabolism within wheat. The findings suggest that P450 and GST play crucial roles in the metabolic processes of DBP, involving hydroxylation under mild conditions to generate MBP.",

The dissipation rates of PAEs in the sediment exhibited a positive correlation with exposure time, with over 68.12% reduction observed after 28 days, even under high initial concentrations. All five PAEs were taken up by the roots from contaminated sediment, translocated into stems and leaves, and their content in each tissue showed significant linear correlations with the sediment content. DEHP demonstrated the highest transportation from sediment to roots and stems, followed by BBP, DBP, DIBP, and DAP, while the order of transportation from roots to leaves was reversed. Throughout the 28-day exposure, the average concentration of each PAE in stems was the highest, followed by roots, leaves, and edible parts. DEHP and BBP were identified as major contaminants in edible parts but were deemed safe for human health. The accumulation of PAEs in edible parts was influenced by various factors, including PAE species and concentration, survival time, and harvest time of edible parts. The study highlighted the potential of Zizania latifolia not only as a safe food source but also as a promising plant for remediating contaminated sediment by accumulating and degrading PAEs from the environment.",
