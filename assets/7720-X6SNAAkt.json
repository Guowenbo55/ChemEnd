The purity of the test substance was reported to be greater than 99.87%. The gavage vehicle was doubly distilled water containing 5 mg Polyoxyl 35 castor oil per 100 mL. An additional control group of 50 male and 50 female rats was gavaged with double distilled water only. All rats received 10 mL/kg bw test substance emulsion, vehicle or double distilled water per dose. ... Mice were housed singly and feed and water were available ad libitum throughout the study. At the initiation of dosing, mice were 49 days old; mean body weight of males was 23 g (range 21-26 g) and mean body weight of females was 19 g (range 17-23 g). At the end of the study, non-fasted mice were decapitated under CO2 anaesthesia. The general health of the test animals was checked daily, and test animals were examined and palpated once a week. Mice were weighed weekly during the first 13 weeks, then every four weeks for the duration of the study. Feed consumption was determined for a period of one week every four weeks during the study. Blood samples were drawn from the tail vein of all surviving animals for hematological examination at 12 months and at the end of the study. Animals that survived to the end of the study were necropsied; tissues and organs were subjected to gross and microscopic pathology examination. No 2-ethyl-1-hexanol-related changes were observed in mice administered 50 or 200 mg/kg bw/day 2-ethyl-1-hexanol for 18 months. In mice administered 750 mg/kg bw/day, the following effects were observed: 1) decreased body weight gain in males (approximately 26%) and females (24%) that was associated with a substantial reduction in feed consumption (males: decreased from about 9% to 20%; females: decreased from about 9% to 30%); 2) increased mortality in males (vehicle controls: 4%; 2-ethyl-1-hexanol-treated: 30%) and females (vehicle controls: 8%; 2-ethyl-1-hexanol-treated: 30%); 3) treatment-related hematological changes, including slightly increased polymorphonuclear neutrophils in males and females (males: controls - 19.8 + or - 5.9% (12 mo) and 20.5 + or - 7.6% (18 mo); 750 mg/kg bw/day - 26.4 + or - 9.1% (12 mo) and 26.9 + or - 13.5% (18 mo))(females: controls - 20.6 + or - 5.6% (12 mo) and 22.6 + or - 10.7% (18 mo); 750 mg/kg bw/day - 24.2 + or - 5.4 (12 mo) and 25.1 + or - 9% (18 mo)) and slightly decreased lymphocytes in males and females (males: controls - 77 + or - 6.9% (12 mo) and 76.6 + or - 7.6% (18 mo); 750 mg/kg bw/day - 69.1 + or - 9% (12 mo) and 70.6 + 13.2% (18 mo)); and 4) treatment-related, but not statistically significant, increased focal hyperplasia of the epithelium of the forestomach in males (controls - 1/50; 50 mg/kg bw/day - 1/50; 200 mg/kg bw/day - 1/50; 750 mg/kg bw/day - 5/50) and females (controls - 1/50; 50 mg/kg bw/day - 1/50; 200 mg/kg bw/day - 0/50; 750 mg/kg bw/day - 4/50). Also, a slight increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in high-dose females was statistically significant when compared to the incidence in vehicle control females but not when compared to the incidence in water-gavaged control females (vehicle control - 0/50; 50 mg/kg bw/day - 1/50; 200 mg/kg bw/day - 3/50; 750 mg/kg bw/day - 5/50).

            "Value": "/ENDOCRINE MODULATION/ Phthalate plasticizers are used in the plastics industry to aid in processing and impart flexibility to plastics. Due to the broad use of plastics, and the tendency of plasticizers to leach out of polymers, plasticizers have become ubiquitous in the environment. Concerns about the testicular toxicity of phthalate plasticizers, in particular di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have arisen due to their ability to cause male reproductive tract abnormalities in animal models. It has been assumed that the DEHP metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), is the active compound, however, metabolites such as 2-ethylhexanol, 2-ethylhexanal and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, have not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-androgenic potential of these metabolites in vitro with a mouse Leydig tumor cell line, MA-10 cells. DEHP, MEHP and 2-ethylhexanal were found to decrease cell viability, as well as steroidogenic potential. The latter was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify steroid production and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression analysis of key steroidogenic enzymes. 2-Ethylhexanal proved to be the most potent steroidogenic disruptor, offering intriguing implications in the search for the mechanism of phthalate testicular toxicity. Overall, the study suggests the involvement of multiple active metabolites in the testicular toxicity of DEHP."

            "Value": "/ENDOCRINE MODULATION/ Summary and assessment. 2-Ethylhexanol is rapidly absorbed by rats following oral administration and 94 to 97 % is excreted within 96 hours (the greatest proportion within 24 hours), primarily in the urine (69 to 74 %). The remainder is excreted in the faeces (13 to 15 %) and in the breath (8 to 14 %). The main metabolites detected in the urine are 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 5-hydroxy-2-ethylhexanoic acid, 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanediacid and 6-hydroxy-2-ethylhexanoic acid, which exist almost exclusively as glucuronides. On dermal administration to the rat, 5.2 % is absorbed. The acute toxicity of 2-ethylhexanol in animals is low (LD50 rat oral between 2049 and 7000 mg/kg body weight; LD50 rabbit dermal between 1980 and >2600 mg/kg body weight; LD50 rat dermal> 3000 mg/kg body weight; LC50 rat >0,89 <5,3 mg/1 (4 hours); LD50 rat intraperitoneal between 500 and l000 mg/kg body weight). The liver is a target organ on repeated oral administration of 2-ethylhexanol to rats for up to 90 days, with disturbances of liver function, peroxisome proliferation and an increase in the activity of the marker enzyme for peroxisome proliferation, cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidase. No such effect is observed in mice. In general, peroxisome proliferation appears to occur only in rats and dogs, and not to any extent in humans or rhesus monkeys (Cohen and Grasso, 1981). This view has been confirmed in subsequent comparative studies in rats and monkeys, for example with 2-diethylhexylphthalate in vivo (Short et al., 1987) and in hepatocytes from various species in vitro (Mitchell et al., 1985 a; Cornu et al., 1992). In these 90-day gavage studies, the no effect levels have been reported to be 125 mg/kg body weight/day in rats and male mice and 250 mg/kg body weight/ day in female mice. The administration of 2-ethylhexanol to rats in the diet for 90 days caused mild, reversible effects on the liver and spleen only at the highest tested dose of 833 mg/kg body weight. On repeated dermal application of 2 ml/kg body weight (on 12 occasions), no specific symptoms of toxicity were found in rats, but effects on the liver, lung, kidney, heart, testis, thymus and adrenal glands were detected histologically. However, in a further study involving dermal application of 1 ml/kg body weight (on 9 occasions), histological effects were only reported at the site of application. No treatment-related pathological effects were found in rats in a 3-month subchronic inhalation study involving exposure to the vapour at up to 120 ppm, equivalent to 638 mg/m3 air. The no effect level in this study was >= 120 ppm (saturated vapour concentration at 20 degrees). In the rabbit, 2-ethylhexanol is irritating to severely irritating to the skin and 2-Ethylhexanol has given no evidence of activity in tests to determine genotoxic potential (Salmonella/microsome assay mouse lymphoma assay, HPRT test, DNA repair test, UDS test, in vitro chromosome aberration test, in vivo micronucleus test, dominant lethal test in the mouse). Weak induction of mutations (an increase by a factor of 2. 9 compared with the negative control value) has been reported in only one publication (8-azaguanine resistance test with the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 without metabolic activation). However, there are no comparative values with other Salmonella typhimurium strains in the Salmonella/microsome test system, and thus compared with the exclusively negative results obtained in other genotoxicity studies, little significance is attached to this finding. 2-Ethylhexanol demonstrated no carcinogenic activity at the maximum tolerated doses in chronic oral studies carried out over 2 years in rats and 18 months in mice. The no effect levels for systemic toxicity were 50 mg/kg body weigh/day in the rat and 200 mg/kg body weight/day in the mouse. At the higher doses tested, reduced body weight gain, increased mortality, clinical signs of toxicity and changes in organ weights were observed, but there were no macroscopic or microscopic effects. The cell transformation test with 2-ethylhexanol has also given no indication of carcinogenic potential either with or without metabolic activation. In studies of reproductive toxicity carried out in accordance with current guidelines, 2-ethylhexanol was not embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or mice on oral administration or in rats on dermal application at doses that were not maternally toxic. Moreover, no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects were found in rats, despite marginal maternal toxicity, following inhalation of the maximum possible vapour concentration of 2-ethylhexanol at room temperature. In humans, no skin sensitizing potential has been noted with 2-ethylhexanol but mild skin irritation has been reported. No effect on the course of pregnancy has been observed in a limited number of women who were occupationally exposed to 2-ethylhexanol."
