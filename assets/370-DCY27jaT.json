    "Description": "Gallic acid is a trihydroxybenzoic acid in which the hydroxy groups are at positions 3, 4, and 5. It has a role as an astringent, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a plant metabolite, an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, a human xenobiotic metabolite, an EC 1.13.11.33 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and a geroprotector. It is a conjugate acid of a gallate.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF value suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

An aerobic biodegradation study of gallic acid, based on COD measurements, using an activated sludge inoculum of 100 mg/l and an initial pyrogallic acid concentration of 200 ppm, indicated 90.5 percent COD removal over a period of 5 days at pH=7.2 and 20 \u00b0C(2). An aerobic biodegradation study of gallic acid, based on BOD measurements, using an acclimated sewage inoculum at and an unknown gallic acid concentration, indicated 0 percent BODT, over a period of 5 days(3). The carbon dioxide evolution from pasture soil (pH=6.7) and arable sandy soil (pH=6.2) was studied after addition of gallic acid to the soil and an incubation period of 300 hours at 13 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C(4). The decomposition of gallic acid, reflected as carbon dioxide production, became exponential within 10 hours(4). ANAEROBIC: Under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, gallic acid is mineralized to methane and carbon dioxide in the presence of certain Rhodospirillaceae(5)."
