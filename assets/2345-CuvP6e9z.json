    "Description": "Benzyl benzoate is a benzoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of benzoic acid with benzyl alcohol. It has been isolated from the plant species of the genus Polyalthia. It has a role as a scabicide, an acaricide and a plant metabolite. It is a benzyl ester and a benzoate ester. It is functionally related to a benzoic acid.",

Biochemical, histopathological, and morphological examinations were performed. Dams were observed for maternal body weights and food and water consumption and subjected to cesarean section on (GD) 20. Maternal and fetal liver, kidney, heart, brain, and placenta were examined histopathologically under light microscope. Maternal and fetal liver and placenta were stained immunohistochemically for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Morphometric analysis of fetal body lengths, placental measurements, and fetal skeletal stainings was performed. Statistically significant alterations in biochemical parameters and placental and skeletal measurements were determined in treatment groups. In addition to histopathological changes, considerable differences were observed in the immunolocalization of VEGF in treatment groups. These results demonstrated that benzyl benzoate and its metabolites can transport to the placenta and eventually enter the fetuses."
