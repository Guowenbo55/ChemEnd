Grab samples of groundwater aquifer soil that had acclimated to creosote wastes containing acenaphthene were able to degrade acenaphthene at concentration between 0.02 and 0.12 ppm under aerobic conditions at 25 \u00b0C for a 56 day period at an average rate of 130% per week(2); an average loss of 5.0% per week was observed for autoclaved controls(2). Unacclimated material from the same aquifer degraded acenaphthene at an average rate of 6.6% per week; however, autoclaved controls lost acenaphthene at an overall rate of 9.2% per week(2). The biotransformation half-life for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with zero suspended solids was 24.8 days(3). The half-lives for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with suspended solid concentration of 52, 403 and 601 mg/L from Roselawn Pond, Denton, TX were 3.52, 4.03 and 2.23 days, respectively(3). The half-lives for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with suspended solid concentrations of 83, 397 and 591 mg/L from Pat Mayseake, Paris, TX were 4.91, 1.20 and 0.83 days, respectively(3); all half-lives were corrected for abiotic losses by controls(3). Acenaphthene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(4)."

Two parallel 0.1 l/s (1.5-g/m) treatment sequences were operated: a control and an experimental sequence spiked with the 22 compounds being investigated. The organic compounds studied, spiked at a normal concentration of 50 ug/L each, were typically removed to the 95-98% level. Many were partitioned to the primary and return activated sludges.

The anaerobic biodegradation of acenaphthene in two soils was investigated under various conditions(1). In soil tests at 20-40 \u00b0C, acenaphthene had half-lives on the order of 30-99 days. In one specific test protocol (non-acclimated soil), acenaphthene (and fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and pyrene) did not degrade much faster in non-sterile versus sterile control soils over a 90-day incubation. However, when consortia-treated river sediments from a polluted river were added, percentage of remaining acenaphthene dropped from 91-92% to 23-44%, suggesting an importance of acclimated microbes(2)."
