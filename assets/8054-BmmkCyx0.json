            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ Oral dosing of adult male F344 rats with the glycol ether 2-methoxyethanol (ME) or its principal metabolite 2-methoxyacetic acid (MAA) results in the suppression of the primary plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide (TNP-LPS). In the present study, the PFC response to TNP-LPS was used to evaluate the immunotoxic potential of ethylene glycol (EG) as well as the glycol ethers 2-methoxyethyl acetate (MEA), 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethanol, bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether, 2-ethoxyethanol and its principal metabolite 2-ethoxyacetic acid, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, and 2-butoxyethanol relative to ME and MAA. Rats were immunized with TNP-LPS and then exposed 4 and 28 hr later to 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg of glycol ether or EG. Three days following immunization, the PFC response to TNP-LPS was determined. In addition to ME and MAA, only MEA, which was as effective as ME, suppressed the PFC response to TNP-LPS. Concomitant administration of the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole with ME or MEA prevented suppression of the PFC response by these glycol ethers. These results indicate that of the chemicals tested only ME, MEA, and MAA are immunosuppressive, and that oxidative metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase is necessary for ME- and MEA-suppression of the response to TNP-LPS."

            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ The results of recent studies on the immunotoxicity of 2-methoxy-ethanol (ME) and its metabolite 2-methoxyacetic-acid (MAA) were reviewed and discussed. Oral dosing of male and female rats with ME or MAA at 50 to 200mg/kg/day for 10 days resulted in thymic involution in the absence of reductions in body or spleen weight; reduced lymphoproliferative response to the T-cell mitogens concanavalin-A and phytohemagglutinin, the B-cell mitogen Salmonella-typhimurium mitogen, and the T-cell and B-cell mitogen pokeweed mitogen; depressed production of interleukin-2 by splenocytes; decreased numbers of splenic CD4+ helper/inducer T-lymphocytes; delayed onset of expulsion of Trichinella-spiralis adult worms; and changes in the primary antibody response to sheep red blood cells and trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide. The plaque forming cell (PFC) response was one of the most sensitive immunologic end points for immunosuppression in the rat. In testing the immunosuppressive potential of other glycol ethers and their metabolites, only 2-methoxyethyl-acetate (MEA) suppressed the PFC response. Recent studies indicate that methoxyacetaldehyde (MALD) is also immunotoxic in the rat. The choice of species is significant in that rats have been shown to be very sensitive to ME induced immunosuppression, while mice are very insensitive. The authors conclude that metabolism of ME to MALD and MAA, via alcohol-dehydrogenase and aldehyde-dehydrogenase is required for immunosuppression in the rat. They suggest that differences in the pharmacokinetics of ME and its metabolites and/or in the sensitivity of immune system components between rats and mice may explain this species difference."
