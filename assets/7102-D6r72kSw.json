            "Value": "AEROBIC: 4-Biphenylamine was 0-50% degraded at the end of a 28 day test period in a static biodegradability test in which 2 mg/L of the compound was seeded with sludge, mineral salts, 5 mg/l yeast, with 7-day static incubation followed by 3 weekly subcultures(1); this was considered as slowly degraded with acclimation under the conditions of this test system(1). In another static system procedure where a 1% solution of the chemical in an emulsifier was added to a bacterial suspension at a concentrations of 1 to 2 ppm, 4-biphenylamine was 50% degraded at the end an initial 7-day incubation period(2). Two analogous compounds, aniline (phenylamine) and biphenyl, were classified as readily biodegradable by the Japanese MITI test (OECD Guideline 301C)(3). Aniline and biphenyl, present at 100 mg/L, reached 85 and 66% of their respective theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(3)."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of 4-biphenylamine can be estimated to be 2470(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-biphenylamine is expected to have slight mobility in soil. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(3,4), suggesting that mobility may be lower in some soils(SRC)."
