            "content": "The aim of this study was to assess the bioavailability of epoxiconazole (EPO) and difenoconazole (DIF) in rice plants by evaluating their uptake, translocation, and accumulation. The results showed that the concentration of DIF in the roots was approximately three times higher than EPO, and both accumulated mainly in the roots. In addition, EPO continued to be transported from stems to leaves, causing a rise in its concentration in leaves, whereas only a minimal amount of DIF was transported to the leaves. This phenomenon is mainly governed by their differing octanol-water partition coefficient. The effects of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the accumulation of EPO and DIF in the roots were similar to those of the freely dissolved concentration measured by OECAMs. Furthermore, the concentrations of EPO and DIF in the roots and OECAMs consistently decreased with increasing DOC levels. A significant linear relationship was also observed between the EPO and DIF concentrations in root and OECAMs, confirming the accuracy and usefulness of the OECAMs method in predicting the bioavailability of EPO and DIF in rice roots. Therefore, OECAMs show good potential for use as a passive sampler to evaluate the bioavailability of EPO and DIF.",

To enhance the chemical control of BRRD and prevent the emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study examined the control efficacy and systemic activity of fungicides with various modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with different modes of action were tested for their inhibitory effects on 39 P. noxius isolates from multiple regions. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (target-site G1) exhibited colony growth inhibition of P. noxius by 99.9% to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7% to 99.8% at 1 ppm. Another effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings, with cyproconazole and tebuconazole being the most efficiently absorbed by roots and transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments indicated that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD compared to mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Since all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered over trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.",

By studying pesticide absorption and conductivity and selecting suitable pesticides for root application, the adverse effects of environmental factors on pesticide ingredients can be reduced.
