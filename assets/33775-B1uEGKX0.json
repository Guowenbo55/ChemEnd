    "Description": "Norflurazon is a pyridazinone that is pyridazin-3(2H)-one which is substituted at positions 2, 4, and 5 by m-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, chloro, and methylamino groups, respectively. A pre-emergence herbicide used to control grasses and broad-leafed weeds in a variety of crops. Not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a pyridazinone, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes, an organochlorine compound and a secondary amino compound.",

The aim was to assess the impact of this herbicide on growth and chlorophyll levels in the rootstocks, as well as examine the uptake, translocation, and metabolism of C-norflurazon in the roots. The results showed that norflurazon treatment led to reduced chlorophyll levels and overall growth in sour orange, Swingle, Milam, and Cleopatra mandarin rootstocks. However, Carrizo rootstock was relatively unaffected by the herbicide in terms of chlorophyll levels and growth. In Cleopatra, chlorosis was observed mainly along the midrib and major veins. Swingle rootstock exhibited higher total absorption of 14C-norflurazon and greater presence of the herbicide in the roots compared to other rootstocks. Translocation of 14C-norflurazon to the foliage was limited in all rootstocks, and stem and taproot contained only small amounts of C-norflurazon. Metabolism of norflurazon showed minor differences among the citrus rootstocks but did not explain their varying sensitivity to the herbicide.",
