            "Value": "AEROBIC: Under aerobic conditions, some investigators report little or no degradation in up to 25 weeks(1-3) while others report considerable degradation: 49% in 7 days, 100% in 28 days; however, a large fraction of this loss was probably due to volatilization(4); 25% in 14 days(5), and 67% in 24 days(6). No marine biodegradation of chloroform has been reported(7). Chloroform, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its Theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(8). Among the aerobic microorganisms, chloroform has been shown to be degradable only by methanotrophic bacteria(9). When it is introduced into an aerobic bioreactor for treatment, it appears in the effluent and is not degraded(9). At an air/water flow rate of 0.10 cu cm/cu m min, chloroform, at an initial concentration of 43.3 ug/L had an average effluent concentration of 3.6 ug/L with 32.5% being air stripped and 59.2% being degraded(10). Chloroform removal was low and a half-life was not observed after 42 days(11). Chloroform, at 1.0 and 1.2 mg/L, was found to be recalcitrant under aerobic conditions(12). Chloroform was transformed >99% when introduced to microorganisms previously fed butane after 50 days with a 10 day lag, but not when introduced to ammonia, methane or propane fed microorganisms(13). Chloroform had influent concentrations of 15,250 and <5.0 ug/L and effluent concentrations of <14 and <5.0 ug/L using an activated sludge with a daily mass loading of COD/bacterial mass ratios of 0.3 and 0.6, respectively(14). Chloroform was reduced from 0.12 mg/L to <40 ug/L after anaerobic digestion at 25 \u00b0C for 53 days and then was digested aerobically for 20 days which reduced chloroform to a not detected level(15). Chloroform was not degraded aerobically or anaerobically in an aquifer storage and recovery site(16)."

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: Several studies have demonstrated that at low concentrations, chloroform can be anaerobically degraded by methanogenic bacteria in the presence of a primary substrate such as acetic acid(1). When a batch study was conducted using a mixed methanogenic culture at 35 \u00b0C, chloroform underwent complete biodegradation from an initial concentration of 0.34 uM solution using acetic acid as the primary substrate(1). Chloroform underwent 96% degradation from an initial concentration of 0.28 uM in a continuous-flow fixed film methanogenic column which was fed acetic acid as the primary substrate(1). Chloroform has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on degradation at concentrations as low as 1.67 uM(1). At an initial concentration of 22.6 uM, 96% of chloroform was reduced by sulfate-reducing organisms(2). Rates of transformation by the sulfate-reducing culture were found to be much higher than the rates observed for an acetic acid utilizing methanogenic culture(2). The culture degraded chloroform primarily by reductive dehalogenation leading to the formation of an equimolar amount of dichloromethane, which was degraded at a very slow rate compared to chloroform(2). Additional acclimation of the culture for 1 year did not lead to any appreciable change in the rate of transformation of chloroform(2). Chloroform was not degraded under anaerobic conditions in leachate from a Gloucester site in Canada(3). Chloroform, at 1.0 and 1.2 mg/L, was found to be recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions(4). Under anaerobic conditions, slow degradation has been reported after acclimation(5) and degradation was reported in river bank (31% in <1 yr) and dune (100% in <3 mo) infiltration(6). However, another investigator reported no degradation in 27 weeks in aquifer material in the laboratory(7)."

Under these conditions, the loss of cytochrome p450 and the inhibition of related mono-oxygenases were also observed. The chloroform anoxic biotransformation was negligible in uninduced microsomes and seemed to be catalyzed mainly by phenobarbital-inducible p450 isozymes. Biotransformation could also be supported by NADH as the source of reducing equivalents. Anaerobic metabolism of chloroform led to decreased levels of the main phenobarbital-induced p450 isozymes even at low chloroform concentration, and did not affect benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity. These effects were not decreased by thiolic compounds. The oxidation products of chloroform caused a general impairment of the monoxygenase system, probably related to the formation of protein aggregates with very high molecular weight. In the presence of physiological concentrations of GSH, the targets of aerobically-produced metabolite were lipids, and, to a smaller extent, p450. At low chloroform concentrations and/or in the presence of GSH, the most changes to microsomal structures seemed to be produced by the reductively-formed intermediates."

Each of the THMs also demonstrated interference with tubular reabsorption, as assessed by urinary glucose excretion, with maximal interference occurring during the first day post-treatment and recovery being observed during the second day post-treatment. In each case, CHCl2Br was the most potent inhibitor of proximal tubular function. Combining these data with those of the preceding paper, the relative potency in disrupting renal function was, in general, CHCl2Br > CHCl3 > CHClBr2 > CHBR3.

We developed two new mouse models, one having proximal tubule-specific deletion of the cytochrome P450 reductase (Cpr) gene (the enzyme required for all microsomal P450 activities), designated proximal tubule-Cpr-null (PTCN), and the other having proximal tubule-specific rescue of CPR activity with the global suppression of CPR activity in all extra-proximal tubular tissues, designated extra-proximal tubule-Cpr-low (XPT-CL).

Renal toxicity was assessed by measuring BUN and creatinine levels, and by pathological examination. The blood and tissue levels of chloroform were determined. The severity of toxicity was less in PTCN and CL mice, compared with that of WT and XPT-CL mice. There were no significant differences in chloroform levels in the blood, liver, or kidney, between PTCN and WT mice, or between XPT-CL and CL mice. These findings indicate that local P450-dependent activities play an important role in the nephrotoxicity induced by chloroform.

Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), reduced cytochrome c and metallothioneins (MTs) levels as well as the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the activities of the biochemical markers of hepatic injury (alanine transaminase [ALT] and aspartate transaminase [AST]) were determined. CHCl(3) did not cause a significant increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation. However, dose-dependant and/or time dependant effects of CHCl(3) were demonstrated on most of the oxidative stress parameters measured, namely the GSH depletion and the superoxide anion production. Acute exposure CHCl(3) increased the aminotransferase and GPx activities and reduced cytochrome c levels in a dose-dependant pattern. A well-combined dose-dependent and time-dependent effect of CHCl(3) on MT levels after acute and subacute exposure was noticed. Moreover, the increase of MT levels seems to be associated with the GSH depletion, indicating a possible role of the latter in MT synthesis. In conclusion, the superoxide anion production and the GSH depletion could be implicated in the mechanism of hepatotoxity of CHCl(3) and MTs seem to be a part of the antioxidant defense system against the oxidative damage caused by CHCl(3) in liver."

Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) intervention led to 70% mortality in primed mice challenged with lethal dose. These data suggest that higher detoxification may play a role in the lower initiation of kidney injury observed in primed mice. Exposure of primed mice to a lethal dose of chloroform led to 40% lower chloroform levels (AUC(15-360 min)) in the systemic circulation. Exhalation of (14)C-chloroform was unchanged in primed as compared to unprimed mice (AUC(1-6 hr)). Urinary excretion of (14)C-chloroform was higher in primed mice after administration of the lethal dose. However, neither slightly higher urinary elimination nor unchanged expiration can account for the difference in systemic levels of chloroform. Liver and kidney regeneration was inhibited by the lethal dose in unprimed mice leading to progressive injury, organ failure, and 90% mortality. In contrast, sustained and highly stimulated compensatory hepato- and nephrogenic repair prevented the progression of injury resulting in 100% survival of primed mice challenged with the lethal dose. These findings affirm the critical role of tissue regeneration and favorable detoxification (only in kidney) of the lethal dose of chloroform in subchronic chloroform priming-induced autoprotection."

Male Swiss Webster (SW) mice were given three dose levels of chloroform (150, 225, and 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage in aqueous vehicle for 30 days. Liver and kidney injury were measured by plasma ALT and BUN, respectively, and by histopathology. Tissue regeneration was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation into hepato- and nephro-nuclear DNA and by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining. In addition, GSH and CYP2E1 in liver and kidney were assessed at selected time points. The levels of chloroform were measured in blood, liver, and kidney during the dosing regimen (1, 7, 14, and 30 days). Kidney injury was evident after 1 day with all three doses and sustained until 7 days followed by complete recovery. Mild to moderate liver injury was observed from 1 to 14 days with all three dose levels followed by gradual decrease. Significantly higher regenerative response was evident in liver and kidney at 7 days, but the response was robust in kidney, preventing progression of injury beyond first week of exposure. While the kidney regeneration reached basal levels by 21 days, moderate liver regeneration with two higher doses sustained through the end of the dosing regimen and 3 days after that. Following repeated exposure for 7, 14, and 30 days, the blood and tissue levels of chloroform were substantially lower with all three dose levels compared to the levels observed with single exposure. Increased exhalation of (14)C-chloroform after repeated exposures explains the decreased chloroform levels in circulation and tissues. These results suggest that toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (tissue regeneration) contribute to the tolerance observed in SW mice to subchronic chloroform toxicity. Neither bioactivation nor detoxification appears to play a decisive role in the development of this tolerance."

Animals were exposed to concentrations of chloroform ranging from 2-300 ppm (10-1460 mg/cu m) for 6 hours per day, either 5 or 7 days per week, for up to 13 weeks (90 days). All animals were examined for histological lesions of liver, kidney, and nasal epithelium. Some animals were administered bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) via osmotic pump prior to sacrifice in order to measure the labeling index (LI). Exposure to chloroform caused histopathological lesions in liver, kidney, and nasal epithelium of both rats and mice. Lesions in liver were characterized by scattered vacuolated hepatocytes and necrotic foci, sometimes with inflammation, mainly in the centrilobular and midzonal regions. Renal lesions occurred primarily in the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules in the cortex. Changes included vacuolation, a basophilic appearance, tubule cell necrosis, and enlarged cell nuclei. Nasal lesions were characterized as atrophy of olfactory epithelium, mainly in the ethmoid portion of the nasal passage. In most cases, histological effects in liver and kidney were not observed until exposure levels were about 30 ppm or higher. However, atrophy of the nasal epithelium was observed in rats at the lowest exposure level tested (2 ppm). Histological changes were generally accompanied by statistically significant increases in Labeling Index, although not always at exactly the same exposure level. These increases in Labeling Index are interpreted as evidence that the cytotoxic responses in these tissues triggers a regenerative hyperplasia. Increased cell proliferation was not found in either sex of rats exposed to chloroform for 6 weeks and held (without exposure) until week 13, suggesting that cell proliferation is dependent on the presence of chloroform and represents a regenerative response to cytotoxicity."

This study compares dose-response relationships of gavage-administered chlorinated/brominated trihalomethanes for hepatotoxicity, replicative DNA synthesis, and hepatocarcinogenicity in female B6C3F1 mice. The liver tumor data were obtained from previously published studies. Because bromine is a better leaving group than chlorine, metabolism of bromodichloromethane (BDCM) should produce the same intermediates as would be formed from TCM. Hence, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of BDCM was expected to be qualitatively similar to that of TCM. Dose responses for liver weight, serum sorbitol dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, hepatocyte degeneration, and hepatocyte labeling index (LI, a measure of replicative DNA synthesis) in female mice were similar following 3 weeks of gavage administration (once per day, 5 days per week) with TCM, BDCM, or chlorodibromomethane (CDBM). Fits of composite data for these trihalomethanes to a Hill equation model revealed sigmoidal dose responses for ALT activity and hepatocyte LI and a nearly linear low-dose response for liver tumor incidence. For this family of chemicals, the mouse liver tumor response was not associated with an elevated hepatocyte LI at doses of approximately 1 mmol/kg or less. High incidences of liver tumors were observed with BDCM and CDBM at doses that had a marginal effect or no effect on the hepatocyte LI.

This compares to a 24% incidence observed when 180 mg/kg per day of chloroform was administered for 78 weeks in earlier studies. In contrast, chloroform in the drinking water of mice failed to increase the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in female B6C3F1 mice. The highest dose group received a time-weighted average dose of 263 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks, resulting in a 5% combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas relative to a 6% incidence in the control groups. In a prior National Cancer Institute study an 80% incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was observed at 270 mg/kg/day for 78 weeks. Chloroform administered in drinking water evidently is capable of inducing cancer in the rat kidney. However, the lack of response in the mouse liver when chloroform is supplied in the drinking water suggests that earlier reports of chloroform hepatocarcinogenesis may be related to some interaction with the mode of administration (corn oil gavage)."

At postnatal day 1 (PND1) pups of dams exposed to chloroform had significantly higher serum glucose levels and lower insulin levels, but this effect was not due to beta-cell depletion in the neonatal pancreas. Glucose homeostasis in response to a glucose challenge was not changed by chloroform treatment. Chloroform exposure did not affect birthweight; however, offspring of dams exposed to chloroform had significantly impaired postnatal growth. Although fetal and neonatal exposure to chloroform did not elicit physiological changes associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes, there were physiological changes resulting in impaired postnatal growth."

A significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with ossification of less than two caudal vertebral centers was observed at all concentrations.

Finally, all exposure groups exhibited a significant increase in the incidence of both litters and fetuses with nonossified or weakly ossified sternebrae; however, there was no statistically significant concentration-related trend for this effect.

The WHO committee noted that largely negative results have been obtained in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli (with and without activation), in gene mutation tests in CHO cells and human lymphocytes, in mouse micronucleus tests, and in tests of unscheduled DNA synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Given the large number of sensitive assays that have been used to investigate the genotoxicity of chloroform, the committee considered it noteworthy that the positive responses were so few, and that the positive results were randomly distributed among the various assays. Taken together, WHO concluded that the weight of evidence indicates that neither chloroform nor its metabolites appear to interact directly with DNA or possess genotoxic activity."

Additionally, GSTT1 also participates in dichloromethane activation. Despite the oxidative metabolism of these compounds and the production of oxidative adducts, their genotoxicity in the bone marrow micronucleus test is unclear. The objective of this work was to analyze whether the oxidative metabolism induced by the coexposure to these compounds would account for increased micronucleus frequency. We used an approach including the analysis of phase I, phase II, and antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers, and micronuclei in bone marrow (MNPCE) and hepatocytes (MNHEP). Rats were administered different doses of an artificial mixture of CLF/DCM/TOL, under two regimes. After one administration MNPCE frequency increased in correlation with induced GSTT1 activity and no oxidative stress occurred. Conversely, after three-day treatments oxidative stress was observed, without genotoxicity.

Chloroform had volatilized from the incubation and glutathione was depleted by 1 hr; however, toxicity was not significantly different between control and chloroform-incubated cells.

Nitration of this protein was inhibited by cyclosporine A, L-NMMA, 7-NI, or NAC. The data indicate that chloroform-induced cell death occurs in two phases: a metabolic phase characterized by glutathione depletion, and an oxidative phase characterized by MPT and protein nitration."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Mechanisms of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride toxicity to primary cultured male B6C3F1 mouse hepatocytes were investigated. The cytotoxicity of both chloroform and carbon tetrachloride was dose and duration dependent. Maximal hepatocyte toxicity, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the culture medium, occurred with the highest concentrations of chloroform (5 mM) and carbon tetrachloride (2.5 mM) used and with the longest duration of treatment (20 hr). Carbon tetrachloride was approximately 16 times more toxic than chloroform to the hepatocytes. The toxicity of these compounds was decreased by adding the mixed function oxidase system inhibitor, SKF-525A (25 microM) to the cultures. The addition of diethyl maleate (0.25 mM), which depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH)-potentiated chloroform and carbon tetrachloride toxicity. The toxicity of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride could also be decreased by adding the antioxidants N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (25 microM), alpha-tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E) (0.1 mM), or superoxide dismutase (100 U/ml) to the cultures. These results suggest that: in mouse hepatocytes, both chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are metabolized to toxic components by the mixed function oxidase system; GSH plays a role in detoxifying those metabolites; free radicals are produced during the metabolism of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride and free radicals may be important mediators of the toxicity of these two halomethanes."

A 90-day gavage study of one of the compounds, trichloromethane, was also done. Parameters observed included body and organ weights, histopathology, hematology, clinical chemistries, and hepatic microsomal enzyme activities. Toxicity to the humoral immune system was assessed by measuring the number of splenic IgM antibody-forming cells and the serum antibody level to sheep erythrocytes. Cell-mediated immunity was evaluated by measuring the delayed type hypersensitivity response and popliteal lymph node proliferation response to sheep red blood cells. The functional activity of the reticuloendothelial system, as measured by the vascular clearance rate and tissue uptake of 51Cr sheep red blood cells was also determined. The major effects of the halomethanes were increased liver weights, elevations of SGPT and SGOT, decreased spleen weights and a decrease in the number of splenic IgM antibody-forming cells.

The aim of this study was to characterize the immunotoxic effects of chloroform in female B6C3F1 mice when exposure occurred via the drinking water. Consistent with human exposure, female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to chloroform-containing drinking water at 2.5, 10, 25, 100, and 250 ppm for 28 days. The examined endpoints included the effects of chloroform on body and organ weights, water consumption, hematology, innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity. The functions of natural killer, B-, and T-cells were not altered by chloroform in drinking water at the concentrations tested, except that an increase in splenocyte basal proliferation was observed at chloroform levels of 100 and 250 ppm. Following chloroform administration, there was a decreased number of circulating neutrophils in the blood in all treatment groups, but neutrophil function in lung homogenates, as evaluated using an assay for myeloperoxidase activity following lipopolysaccharide and N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe stimulation, was not compromised. Further, the results of host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection also suggested that neutrophil function was normal. At the highest treatment level of chloroform (250 ppm), erythrocyte number and hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased. Some significant changes were also observed for body weights, water consumption, and organ weights; however, most of these effects were only observed at the highest treatment level of chloroform (250 ppm). Taken together, the results demonstrate that while chloroform administered via the drinking water affects body weight and selected hematological parameters at high dose levels, overall immune responses, as measured in several tests for immune function, are not compromised."

Trichloroethylene (TCE) and chloroform are among 33 hazardous air pollutants identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as presenting the greatest threat to public health in the largest number of urban areas. Also, both are common indoor air pollutants. Here, we assessed the potential effects of TCE and chloroform on resistance to pulmonary bacterial infection and related alveolar macrophage (AM) function. CD-1 mice were exposed by inhalation to filtered air (control) or concentrations of TCE ranging from 5 to 200 ppm, or concentrations of chloroform ranging from 100 to 2000 ppm. Immediately following exposure, mice were challenged with an aerosol of Streptococcus zooepidemicus and monitored for clearance of bacteria from the lung and mortality. In separate experiments, exposed mice were injected intratracheally with viable bacteria and phagocytic function was evaluated in macrophages obtained from lung washes 30 min later. The NOEL for enhanced mortality to infection was 25 ppm for TCE and 500 ppm for chloroform. Relative to the air controls, differences in clearance of bacteria from the lung were noted in mice exposed to TCE (NOEL= 50 ppm) and to chloroform (NOEL 100 ppm), and differences in AM phagocytic index were noted for TCE (NOEL= 100 ppm) and for chloroform (NOEL < 100 ppm). The data support the utility of the S. zooepidemicus infectivity model in assessing potential increased risk of respiratory infection and suggest that delayed clearance of bacteria from the lung or decreased phagocytosis are viable alternatives to mortality as an endpoint. Collectively, these endpoints are among the most sensitive health effects reported for TCE."
