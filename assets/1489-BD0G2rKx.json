    "Description": "2,4-DB is a monocarboxylic acid that is butyric acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 4 is replaced by a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy group. A selective post-emergence herbicide. It has a role as an agrochemical, a synthetic auxin and a phenoxy herbicide. It is an organochlorine compound, a monocarboxylic acid and an aromatic ether. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butanoate.",

Merr.] and cocklebur (Xanthium sp.) were investigated at 3, 5, 7, and 11 weeks after planting by means of radioautography and standard radioassay methods. Partitioning of radioactivity varied with plant age and with treatment time. Although a species difference was not observed in the total uptake of 2,4-DB, the rate of penetration of the herbicide was greater in cocklebur than in soybean. The 2,4-DB was retained in the treated leaf and was not translocated to other plant parts. Translocated radioactivity occurred principally in actively growing parts of both species, but only trace quantities were detected in soybean. No radioactivity was detected in the lower leaves of either plant. Plant response to 2,4-DB may be partially explained on the basis of differential penetration and translocation.",
