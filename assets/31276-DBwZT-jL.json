            "Value": "AEROBIC: Biodegradation studies with isoamyl acetate were not available(SRC, 2015). Structurally similar compounds such as butyl acetate and isopropyl acetate have achieved 50.7 and 40.0%, respectively, of their theoretical BODs after 10 days in mineralized water and settled sanitary sewage at 20 \u00b0C(1). Butyl acetate present at 100 mg/L, reached 86% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(2). Isobutyl acetate, methyl amyl acetate, and other alkyl acetates have achieved between 69-81% of their theoretical BODs after 20 days in fresh water tests with non-acclimated sludge(3). These data suggest that biodegradation of isoamyl acetate may be an important environmental fate process(SRC)."
