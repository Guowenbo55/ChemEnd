Biodegradation may be fairly rapid especially when microorganisms are acclimated to methyl parathion(2). Comparison of degradation rates in sterile versus nonsterile estuarine systems indicated that biodegradation was the primary route of methyl parathion degradation(3). In a die-away test using water and sediment cores from three sites (Escambia River, FL), methyl parathion had half-lives of 77 to 154 hrs, while in a sterile control the half-life was 367 hrs(4). In strongly reducing anaerobic sediments, the degradation rate was found to be about two orders of magnitude faster than in the same sediments which had been heat-sterilized(5). Biodegradation is significantly faster in sediment containing water than in water alone(4,5). 14C-Methyl parathion was degraded rapidly to carbon dioxide in Cecil sandy loam and Webster silty clay loam maintained at 10 and 33 kPa soil-water tension; >40% mineralization was observed in 14 days, leveling off to approximately 50% by day 28(6). After 32 days incubation in static sediment/water microcosms, 24% of the (14)C-methyl parathion had been mineralized to (14)CO2; degradation products included aminomethyl parathion, 4-aminophenol, and 4-nitrophenol(7)."

Half-lives in nonsterile water, sterile water, and sterile sediment were >30 days, indicating an abiotic process, probably hydrolysis(1). Ring-labeled methyl parathion added to shake flasks containing Pensacola Bay area sediment/water slurries exhibited half-lives ranging from 0.9 to 30 days(2). Rates in nonsterile water, sterile sediment and sterile water were similar, suggesting abiotic loss processes, possibly hydrolysis(2). Degradation was more rapid under flooded conditions than under non-flooded conditions in soils(3,4). In five flooded (non-flooded) Indian soils, methyl parathion half-lives were 4.17 (2.33), 5.50 (8.56), 5.44 (274.56), 3.58 (11.32), and 17.68 (22.43) days in Alluvial, Sukinda, Kari, Pokkali, and Canning soils, respectively(6). Hydrolysis was implicated under non-flooded and to a minor extent in flooded conditions(3,4); degradation under flooded conditions proceeded essentially by nitro group reduction(3,4).

The rate of loss of methyl parathion from pond water isolated in an aquarium was similar to the predicted rate. However, the rate of loss from outdoor ponds, or from aquaria containing plants and sediment, was greater than predicted. Methyl parathion was not detected in sediment even though predicted concentration far exceeded the limit of detection. It is suggested that the rate of biodegradation in shallow bodies of water may be determined predominantly by bacteria attached to sediments and plants, rather than by planktonic bacteria."

            "Value": "A study was conducted examining the inhibition of (Ca2+ and Mg2+)-ATPase by parathion (56382) and methyl parathion. Enzyme activity was assessed spectrophotometrically in pig erythrocyte membranes containing calcium2+ (Ca2+) and magnesium2+ and in solubilized membrane preparations incubated with the test agents. The enzyme response to ATP was biphasic. Equations expressing the kinetics of the substrate curves described two classes of the ATP binding active site, one with high affinity and low maximum rate and one with low affinity and high maximum rate. High affinity active sites were stimulated by low ATP concentrations (20 uM), whereas low affinity active sites were stimulated by high ATP levels (2 mM). Parathion and methylparathion dose dependently inhibited enzyme activity; parathion had a greater inhibitory effect than methylparathion. Lineweaver-Burke and Dixon plots indicated noncompetitive inhibition. Parathion and methylparathion induced enzyme inhibition occurred over a range of free calcium ion concentrations (0.5 to 5 mM); the inhibition was significantly greater at lower Ca2+ concentrations (1 to 100 uM) than at higher concentrations. The authors conclude that parathion and methylparathion inhibit ATPase activity by binding to a site on the enzyme rather than through an interaction with associated lipids."

Three groups of adult female rats received 0, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg methyl parathion via dermal exposure for 95 days. Exposure to 0.1 mg/kg methyl parathion produced inhibition of / acetylcholinesterase / (AChE) in the caudate-putamen and thalamic nuclei, whereas 1.0 mg/kg resulted in inhibition of AChE in most brain regions. The same doses of methyl parathion had no effect on /(3)H-Quinuclidinyl benzylate / ([(3)H]QNB) binding to muscarinic receptors in the brain regions examined. The in vitro study demonstrated that methyl parathion causes preferential inhibition of AChE and [(3)H]QNB binding in specific brain regions. As an inhibitor of AChE, methyl paraoxon was 1,000-fold more potent than was methyl parathion. Similarly, methyl paraoxon showed brain region-specific inhibition of the enzyme. Generally, the brain stem was highly sensitive to organophosphate-induced inhibition of AChE activity and [(3)H]QNB binding. Because central respiratory neurons gather in the brain stem, preferential effects there and in other brain regions may underlie lethal toxicity of methyl parathion and other organophosphates."

Effect of low dose chronic administration of MPTH on AChE activity was also studied in CE, MC, BS, hippocampus (HI), striatum-accumbens (SA), spinal cord (SC) and also in the hypothalamus (HY). Administration of 0.1 mg MPTH/kg from second day to 15 days of age caused significant reduction of AChE activity in only 2 of the 7 brain regions studied. Administration of double the dose (0.2 mg MPTH/kg) and for a longer duration (2nd day to 150 days of age), caused a depression in all the brain regions studied. In all these regions, the levels of NA, DA and 5HT did practically not change. The results suggest that chronic consumption of MPTH leads to a moderate decrease of AChE activity in several brain regions."

According to the results, MP treatments increased significantly the levels of serum marker enzyme activities except for ALT with both dosages and LDH with 5 ppm dosage. Also, the hematological constituents were affected by MP. For example, WBC significantly increased in rats treated with both dosages of MP whereas the other hematologic constituents did not change at 5 and 10 ppm of MP treatments. The observations presented led us to conclude that the administration of subacute MP elevates tissue damage serum marker enzymes, and increases the number of WBC in rats.

The body weights of offspring of treated males did not show significant changes from those of the controls, although there were some decreases observed. MP reduced the lactation index in experiment 2 (P<0.001; Chi-square test). The number of pups/parent along with fertility indices showed some numerical decrease but without any statistical significance. The present findings suggest that MP is a weak genotoxic and cytotoxic agent in the rat exposed to human exposure dose-levels, and that these effects, except the fertility are well correlated with decreased ascorbic acid level in the testis. Furthermore, MP-induced changes in the germ cells do not have any significant effects on F1 generation."

The pregnant females were randomly divided into control groups and experimental groups, the latter of which received MP at the doses of 0.0, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg. Most cells in the maternal-fetal interface showed significant alterations in the presence of MP. Trophoblast giant cells exhibited either prominent characteristics of degeneration or normal morphology with many phagosome vacuoles, apparently containing cell debris. Vascular congestion was also more frequent in the labyrinth of the treated animals. Areas of fibrosis and hemorrhage were found in the decidua, as well as decidual cells presenting pyknotic nuclei and acidophilic cytoplasm. In the placentas of females treated with both restricted diet and MP, such changes were much more severe. Together, these alterations suggest a direct, toxic effect of MP on the placental cells. The phagocytic activity exhibited by trophoblast cells, may be playing a role in the removal of death cells from the maternal-placental interface and/or in a compensatory mechanism to maintain the uptake of maternal nutrients, following decreased metabolic exchange functions of the labyrinth due to the toxic effect of the MP."

The weight of the ductus deferens decreased in experiment 3 at 1 mg/kg dose level (p < 0.001) and increased in experiment 5 (p < 0.05). The weight of the seminal vesicle decreased in experiment 3 at both 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg dose levels (p < 0.001), and increased in experiment 5 (p < 0.01). The weight of the prostate decreased in experiments 4 (in a dose-dependent pattern) and 5 (p < 0.001). ACP levels decreased in experiment 4 (p < 0.001) with a greater effect at 0.5 mg/kg than at 1 mg/kg. In experiment 5 (p < 0.01) cholesterol levels decreased to less than 50% of the control level for this experiment (p < 0.01) and protein levels also decreased (p < 0.01). Vitamin C levels decreased in a dose-dependent pattern in experiments 4 (p < 0.001) and 5 (p < 0.01). There were no effects on uric acid level. Sperm density was decreased in the epididymis of the rats treated and the epithelium of the epididymis and ductus deferens showed cellular necrosis, brush-border disruption and nuclear pyknosis. Nuclei were haloed, except in experiment 2 and the 0.5 mg/kg group of experiment 3. Methyl parathion did not induce significant changes in the structure of the seminal vesicle and prostate, except that epithelial folding was shorter than in the control. In conclusion, MP is a reproductive toxicant in the male rat and causes deterioration in the structural integrity of the reproductive organs and also the biochemical parameters in the epididymis."

Nigrostriatal dopamine neurons receive substantial cholinergic innervation and express a number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. Since epidemiological data have implicated pesticides in the incidence of Parkinson's disease, the current experiment investigated how repeated, developmental exposure to the OPs chlorpyrifos (CPS) or methyl parathion (MPT) affects striatal dopamine levels and dopamine neuron gene expression. Newborn rats were treated daily via oral gavage with corn oil vehicle, CPS, or MPT from postnatal days (PND) 1-21. Rats were sacrificed at PND 22 and 50. Levels of dopamine and its metabolites 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured in the striatum and mRNA expression was measured in the substantia nigra. At 22 days of age, CPS and MPT treatment had no effect on dopamine, DOPAC or HVA levels. At 50 days of age, CPS significantly elevated DOPAC levels and elevated dopamine turnover (DOPAC/dopamine) but did not affect dopamine or HVA levels. MPT had no significant effects on any of these parameters. Interestingly, both CPS and MPT treatments caused a significant alteration in the ratio of alpha7 to alpha6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit expression in the substantia nigra with a non-significant elevation in alpha6 and a reduction in alpha7 at 22 days. At 50 days of age, a significant elevation in alpha6 nAChR subunit was observed in the MPT treated rats. No differences in dopamine neuron transcription factors (Nurr1 or Lmx1b) or neurotransmission genes were observed. These data demonstrate that repeated exposure to OPs during postnatal maturation can have a significant effect on dopamine neurochemistry, primarily by modifying dopamine metabolism, which can persist for up to 1 month (CPS) and alter acetylcholine subunit expression (CPS and MPT)."

Food stuffs such as fruits and vegetables could be contaminated with MP, which may be a potential route of exposure. Previous studies have shown that MP is a reproductive toxicant in animal models. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism of symplast formation and biochemical changes that occur in the testis, following MP exposure. MP was treated to adult male Wistar rats (N=5/dose/sample time) as follows. Experiment 1 - 0, 0.75 or 1.5mg/kg/d ip for 25 days and experiment 2 - 0 or 3.5mg/kg/d p.o. for 25 days and sacrificed on Day 17, after the last exposure. Light microscopic examination of testis was made to evaluate the structural changes and also to establish a process of symplast formation and destruction. Quantitative biochemical estimations were made in the testis for acid phosphatase (ACP), cholesterol, total protein, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). MP induced structural changes in the testis in consensus with the previous studies. The symplasts were found in the testes in experiment 1. Those cells were formed due to the cell fusion of round spermatids. The symplasts were degenerated by nuclear fragmentation. The nuclear fragments were extruded from the symplasts leaving behind only the eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cell fusion and multinucleated giant cell formation was the reason for MP induced tubular atrophy. Number of tubules with symplasts increased in experiment 1 in a dose-dependent pattern. Johnsen's scores also decreased in a dose-dependent manner in experiment 1 indicating a dose-dependent tubular destruction. The ACP, cholesterol, total protein, and LDH levels decreased in both experiments against their respective controls, whereas the uric acid level decreased in experiment 1 and increased in experiment 2 (P<0.01-0.001). The effects in experiment 1 were dose-dependent. In conclusion, MP induces the formation of symplasts by cell fusion of round spermatids, which is a process involved in tubular atrophy and also induces biochemical changes in the testis."

The pregnant females were randomly divided into control groups and experimental groups, the latter of which received MP at the doses of 0.0, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg. Most cells in the maternal-fetal interface showed significant alterations in the presence of MP. Trophoblast giant cells exhibited either prominent characteristics of degeneration or normal morphology with many phagosome vacuoles, apparently containing cell debris. Vascular congestion was also more frequent in the labyrinth of the treated animals. Areas of fibrosis and hemorrhage were found in the decidua, as well as decidual cells presenting pyknotic nuclei and acidophilic cytoplasm. In the placentas of females treated with both restricted diet and MP, such changes were much more severe. Together, these alterations suggest a direct, toxic effect of MP on the placental cells.

The effect was similar in young (15 days) and in adult (70 days) rats.

Our data demonstrated that repeated exposure to MP caused some functional deficits in CNS, but motor activity and associative learning/memory process might differ in the sensitivity to its toxic effect. The motor dysfunctions in MP-treated rats may be mediated via reciprocal balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems at striatum following cholinergic over-stimulation. Our findings also suggest that the CNS deficits induced by repeated exposure to MP or other organophosphate (OP) pesticides cannot be attributed entirely to the inhibition of AChE.

Male mice (10-12-weeks old) were administered Me-Pa (3-20 mg/kg bw/ip) and euthanized at 7- or 28-days post-treatment. Mature spermatozoa were obtained and evaluated for chromatin structure through SCSA (Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay; DNA Fragmentation Index parameters: Mean DFI and DFI%) and chromomycin-A(3) (CMA(3))-staining, for DNA damage through in situ-nick translation (NT-positive) and for oxidative stress through lipid peroxidation (LPO; malondialdehyde production). At 7-days post-treatment (mature spermatozoa when Me-Pa exposure), dose-dependent alterations in chromatin structure (Mean DFI and CMA(3)-staining) were observed, as well as increased DNA damage, from 2-5-fold in DFI% and NT-positive cells. Chromatin alterations and DNA damage were also observed at 28-days post-treatment (cells at meiosis at the time of exposure); suggesting that the damage induced in spermatocytes was not repaired. Positive correlations were observed between LPO and sperm DNA-related parameters. These data suggest that oxidative stress is related to Me-Pa alterations on sperm DNA integrity and cells at meiosis (28-days post-treatment) and epididymal maturation (7-days post-treatment) are Me-Pa targets. These findings suggest a potential risk of Me-Pa to the offspring after transmission."

The DNA damage was measured by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis or comet assay and expressed as DNA damage index. The results showed that both acute and chronic exposure with CPF, MPT, and MLT, caused significantly marked DNA damage in rat tissues namely, liver, brain, kidney, and spleen, when measured 24 hour posttreatment. It was also observed that MPT caused highest level of DNA damage and brain was maximally affected by these OP compounds. When these pesticides were given in mixture, the damage was not the sum of damage caused by individual pesticide, confirming that these pesticides do not potentiate the toxicity of each other. When the DNA damage was measured 48 and 72 hour posttreatment, the damage was partially repaired. Pesticide exposure also caused histopathological changes in rat tissues."

Using selective inhibitors, the great majority of cholinesterase in brain was defined as acetylcholinesterase, while butyrylcholinesterase was the major cholinesterase in heart, regardless of age. In the heart, butyrylcholinesterase was markedly more sensitive than acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by chlorpyrifos oxon, and butyrylcholinesterase in tissues from aging rats was more sensitive than enzyme from adults, possibly due to differences in A-esterase mediated detoxification. Relatively similar differences were noted in brain. In contrast, acetylcholinesterase was more sensitive than butyrylcholinesterase to methyl paraoxon in both heart and brain, but no age-related differences were noted. Both oxons displaced [(3)H]oxotremorine-M binding in heart and brain of both age groups in a concentration-dependent manner.

            "Value": "Moderate adsorption of the parent compound and metabolites to soil and sediment was observed(1-6). Adsorption does not appear to be correlated with % organic content in soil(2). Clay content of soil is important(4). Adsorbs interlaminarly to clay(3,4). Typical soil-water distribution constants range from 3 to 147(1-6), with median values around 50(SRC). Kom (organic matter-normalized partition coefficient) values of 102.0, 95.9, 88.2, and 82.0 were observed in sandy clay loam soil, sandy clay loam soil with 0.1% fly ash, sandy clay loam soil with 0.2% fly ash, and sandy clay loam soil with 0.5% fly ash, respectively(7). Kom values of 636.2, 619.5, 587.8, and 554.2 were observed in clay soil, clay soil with 0.1% fly ash, clay soil with 0.2% fly ash, and clay soil with 0.5% fly ash, respectively(7). A Kd value of 6.2 was determined for homoionic K-montmorillonite(8). An average log Koc of 3.85 was reported in various sediments(9). Sorption of methyl parathion on laboratory-modified humic acids ranged from 4.2 to 7.8 g/kg; sorption on an untreated humic acid was 6.5 g/kg(10). The addition of humic acid to topsoil had no systematic effect on increasing methyl parathion's sorption(10). Kom values of 423.07, 541.55, 366.60, 121.29 were determined in four rice soils(11). Methyl parathion was assigned a pesticide leaching potential of 9; a pesticide leaching potential of 0 indicates no leaching potential, while a pesticide leaching potential of 100 indicates maximum leaching potential(12)."

Uptake and elimination of the pesticides were traced in leaves, stems, and roots of living Malabar spinach plants. Root concentration factor (RCF), distribution concentration factor (DCF), and transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) were calculated based on the in vivo tracing data. The tracing data showed that the OCPs were much more accumulative and persistent than the OPPs in roots, while they were similarly accumulative and persistent in leaves and stems. RCF values of the OPPs or OCPs were likely to increase with the increase in LogKow values except fenthion. Obtained DCF values indicated that OPPs and OCPs were more accumulative in the organs containing more lipids. TSCF values showed that the translocation of OPPs and OCPs from roots to foliage was firstly dependent on the hydrophobicity of the compounds, but also significantly affected by the water solubility. This is the first study of generating RCF, DCF, and TSCF data in living plants by in vivo sampling method, which provides a foundation to promote the application of in vivo SPME and improve understanding of contaminant behaviors in living plants.",
