Early field studies demonstrated that 90% of the applied mevinphos was lost in 0.8 to 4.2 days in a range of crops and that 99% of initial residues were lost in 3.9 days(2). Mean mevinphos losses from lettuce, kohlrabi, green beans, and summer wheat after field application ranged from 86- 99% in 24 hr; loss were ascribed to evaporation(3). A study conducted in Monterey County, CA to ascertain whether mevinphos dissipation on row crops was seasonally dependent and therefore might require a reevaluation of worker reentry intervals, found that the overall half-lives for June, 24 hr (SD = 10 hr), was not markedly different from that for October, 18 hr (SD = 8 hr)(4)."

This degradation rate, which is much more rapid than the rate of hydrolysis in water at pH 9(2), is consistent with a microbially-mediated process(SRC)."

Foliar pesticide levels that caused a 50% depression in plasma or red blood cell cholinesterase were determined with log probit dose response analysis. The greatest cholinesterase responses for emulsifiable concentrate and encapsulated formulations were found with diazinon, followed by parathion and methyl parathion.

Mevinphos forms a stable interlayer complex with montmorillonite; the interaction mechanism is primarily ion- dipole(4). The adsorption of mevinphos was determined in 20 soils, both natural and oxidized to destroy organic carbon, with a range of organic matter, clay type and content, and pH(4).

The results of simple and multiple correlation analyses for the natural and oxidized soils indicate that the most important parameter in the adsorption of mevinphos by soil is the clay content of the soil(4). Adsorption is facilitated by clay-organic matter complexes(4). The clay content and organic matter accounted for 59% of the variability in adsorption(4).
