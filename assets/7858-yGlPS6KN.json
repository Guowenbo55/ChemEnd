            "Value": "Hepatotoxicity of allyl alcohol involves its bioactivation to acrolein and subsequent protein sulfhydryl loss and lipid peroxidation. However, the links between these events and hepatocellular death are not known. The purpose of these studies was to examine whether specific signal transduction pathways are associated with allyl alcohol toxicity in hepatocytes. Inhibition or augmentation of cyclic AMP and/or protein kinase A (PKA) by Rp-Ado-3N,5N-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylamine salt or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine had no effect on allyl alcohol-induced cell death. H-7, an inhibitor of PKA, protein kinase C (PKC), and protein kinase G (PKG), partially inhibited cell killing by allyl alcohol, whereas chelerythrine chloride, a nonselective PKC inhibitor, almost completely abolished allyl alcohol cytotoxicity. Neither  2,2N,3,3N,4,4N-hexahydroxy-1,1N,-biphenyl-6,6N-dimethanol-dimethyl ether, a selective PKC alpha and beta inhibitor, nor bisindolylmaleimide I, an inhibitor of PKC alpha, beta, and epsilon, had any effect on allyl alcohol cytotoxicity. In contrast, rottlerin, a selective PKCdelta inhibitor, blocked hepatocellular killing by allyl alcohol. Cytoprotection by chelerythrine chloride and rottlerin was not the result of inhibition of bioactivation of allyl alcohol because each inhibitor also prevented cell death from acrolein. Western blotting and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that allyl alcohol stimulated phosphorylation and translocation of PKCdelta to hepatocyte membranes (i.e., activation), and this activity was inhibited by rottlerin. Cell death appeared to occur via oncotic necrosis rather than apoptosis based on single-stranded DNA ELISA and propidium iodide staining. Together, these results indicate that activation of PKCdelta is a critical, early event in initiating hepatocyte injury and death from allyl alcohol."

The effects were very rapid, normally reaching a plateau within the first 10 minutes. After exposure, the sensory irritating responses died away very rapidly. No pulmonary irritation was observed at concentrations up to the RD50 in cannulated mice, therefore the respiratory depression observed was due entirely to the chemical's sensory irritating effect. Groups of 4 mice used for each exposure level. Sensory irritation of the upper respiratory tract causes a characteristic pause before exhalation and thereby a decrease in respiratory rate. This bradypnea occurs reflexively from stimulation of the trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal mucosa. ... If exposures were carried out in animals via tracheal cannula, the bypass of the nasal trigeminal nerve endings excludes the development of sensory irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Stimulation of pulmonary receptors by airborne irritants in mice results in a different reflex decrease in respiratory rate due to a pause between the end of expiration and the beginning of the following inspiration resulting in a net decrease in respiratory rate proportional to the log of the concentration of the irritants."

Marked species differences are also recognized; rats are significantly more sensitive to allyl alcohol-induced liver damage than mice, an effect due to the three-fold greater biotransformation of allyl alcohol to acrolein and acrylic acid in rats than in mice. The RD50 values range from 1.6 to 3.9 ppm for the vapor of allyl alcohol in OFI, ICR, and CFI mice exposed between 5 and 30 minutes.

Recent findings in our laboratory demonstrated FMO3 gene induction following toxic acetaminophen (APAP) treatment in mice. The goal of this study was to evaluate FMO3 gene expression in other diverse mouse models of hepatic oxidative stress and injury. FMO3 gene regulation by Nrf2 was also investigated using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. In our studies, male C57BL/6J mice were treated with toxic doses of hepatotoxicants or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL, 10 days). Hepatotoxicants included APAP (400 mg/kg, 24-72 hr), alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT; 50 mg/kg, 2-48 hr), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; 10 or 30 uL/kg, 24 and 48 hr) and allyl alcohol (AlOH; 30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24 hr). Because oxidative stress activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), additional studies investigated FMO3 gene regulation by Nrf2 using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. At appropriate time-points, blood and liver samples were collected for assessment of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, plasma and hepatic bile acid levels, as well as liver FMO3 mRNA and protein expression. FMO3 mRNA expression increased significantly by 43-fold at 12 hr after ANIT treatment, and this increase translates to a 4-fold change in protein levels. BDL also increased FMO3 mRNA expression by 1899-fold, but with no change in protein levels. Treatment of mice with CCl4 decreased liver FMO3 gene expression, while no change in expression was detected with AlOH treatment. Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to APAP (400mg/kg, 72 hr) treatment compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, which is evidenced by greater plasma ALT activity. The FMO3 mRNA and protein expression increased in Nrf2 KO mice after APAP treatment. Collectively, not all hepatotoxicants that produce oxidative stress alter FMO3 gene expression. Along with APAP, toxic ANIT treatment in mice markedly increasedFMO3 gene expression. While BDL increased the Fmo3 mRNA expression, the protein level did not change. The discrepancy with FMO3 induction in cholestatic models, ANIT and BDL, is not entirely clear. Results from Nrf2 KO mice with APAP suggest that the transcriptional regulation of FMO3 during liver injury may not involve Nrf2."

Mice were treated with 14 hepatotoxicants at appropriate doses, and blood and liver samples were collected thereafter (6 hr to 7 days depending on the hepatotoxicant). Graded activation of Nrf2 offered a Nrf2-dependent protection against the hepatotoxicity produced by carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, microcystin, phalloidin, furosemide, cadmium, and lithocholic acid, as evidenced by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and by histopathology. Nrf2 activation also offered moderate protection against liver injury produced by ethanol, arsenic, bromobenzene, and allyl alcohol but had no effects on the hepatotoxicity produced by D-galactosamine/endotoxin and the Fas ligand antibody Jo-2. Graded Nrf2 activation reduced the expression of inflammatory genes (MIP-2, mKC, IL-1 beta , IL-6, and TNF a), oxidative stress genes (Ho-1, Egr1), ER stress genes (Gadd45 and Gadd153), and genes encoding cell death (Noxa, Bax, Bad, and caspase3). Thus, this study demonstrates that Nrf2 prevents the liver from many, but not all, hepatotoxicants.

At the end of the appropriate treatment period, animals were killed by exsanguination following an overnight fast and subject to a post-mortem examination. This included gonadal weights and histopathological examination of testis, ovary and uterus. The calculated mean intake of 2-propen-1-ol over the course of the study (based on body weight and water intake data) was: Males: 0, 4.8, 8.3, 14.0, 48.2 mg/kg bw/d; Females: 0, 6.2, 6.9, 17.1 and 58.4 mg/kg bw/d. Absolute organ weights (including gonadal weights) were generally decreased in males, and to a lesser extent in females, in a time- and treatment related manner. Relative organ weights (including gonadal weights) were generally increased to a statistically significant extent in high dose animals of both sexes at study termination. These changes appeared secondary to a reduction in water intake (presumably due to unpalatability of the treatment solution) and body weight, that was  particularly pronounced in high dose animals. No histopathological abnormalities were reported for testis, ovary or uterus. No treatment-related changes were present in gonadal weights or histopathology in male and female rats given allyl alcohol at received doses of up to 48.2, 58.4 mg/kg bw/d."

Rats were killed by cervical dislocation and liver homogenates (0.25 g of tissue/mL) were prepared in 0.154M-KCl containing 50 mM-tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4. ... The administration of a single oral dose of 2-propen-1-ol produced marked periportal necrosis that was associated with losses of alcohol dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities from the portal areas of the liver lobule. Parallel biochemical investigations confirmed the decrease of activities of both dehydrogenase enzymes. In addition, the activity of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase and hepatic content of cytochrome p-450 were decreased to 59-66% of control values showing an inhibition of hepatic xenobiotic metabolism. However, further daily administration of 2-propen-1-ol for periods of either 10 or 28 days did not produce any potentiation of the hepatotoxic effects observed after a single dose. All the parameters measured had reverted to control values and histological examination of liver sections from treated animals did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. The results of the present study demonstrate the unusual finding that the prolonged administration of a hepatotoxic agent resulted in the complete regression of the initial liver damage. In the absence of any results on alterations in the absorption or distribution of 2-propen-1-ol from the gastrointestinal tract, it must be assumed that the hepatic metabolism of the hepatotoxin becomes modified as a result of repeated treatment. Such an alteration in the metabolism of 2-propen-1-ol may involve the suppression of the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalysed activation pathway and the diversion of the alcohol via alternative pathways leading to non-toxic metabolites."

GSH concentrations decreased 65-75% within 10 minutes of incubation and remained depressed throughout the 2 h incubation period. Control hepatocytes demonstrated slow loss of GSH during the 2-h period. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected 20 min in hepatocytes incubated with either dose of 2-propen-1-ol. PSH concentrations were significantly diminished at 20 min with 0.8 mM and at 30 min with 0.4 mM 2-propen-1-ol and continued to decline throughout the incubation. Hepatocyte viability, measured as LDH leakage into the medium, was the last of the parameters to be affected by exposure to 2-propen-1-ol (30 min for 0.8 mM and 45 min for 0.4 mM). Sulfhydryl compounds makedly delayed the depletion of GSH, prevented significant loss of protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH) and protected cells against viability loss. The sequence of events was as follows: an initial rapid depletion of GSH, a subsequent increase in MDA and decrease in PSH and the eventual loss of membrane integrity. Overall, the results suggest that the inactivation of protein thiol groups is critical for 2-propen-1-ol toxicity whereas lipid peroxidation is not essential to the toxic process."

In the present study the ability of the nonenzymatic product of PGD(2), 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), to increase the cytotoxicity of allyl alcohol was evaluated. In a concentration-dependent manner, 15d-PGJ(2) significantly augmented cell death caused by allyl alcohol in isolated rat hepatocytes. 15d-PGJ(2) also increased the cytotoxicity of acrolein, the active metabolite of allyl alcohol. An agonist for the PGD(2) receptor neither reproduced the increase in allyl alcohol-mediated cytotoxicity nor altered the response to 15d-PGJ(2). Similarly, these responses were not affected by either an agonist or an antagonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. The enhancement by 15d-PGJ(2) of allyl alcohol-mediated cell killing was unaffected by augmentation or inhibition of cAMP. Protein synthesis was markedly decreased by 15d-PGJ(2), but inhibition of protein synthesis alone with cycloheximide did not increase allyl alcohol-mediated cell killing. Allyl alcohol at subtoxic concentrations increased translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), whereas at cytotoxic concentrations no translocation occurred. 15d-PGJ(2) inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytosol to the nucleus both in the presence and absence of allyl alcohol. Like 15d-PGJ(2), MG132, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation, enhanced allyl alcohol-induced hepatocyte death. Together these results indicate that 15d-PGJ(2) augments hepatocyte killing by allyl alcohol, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation."

An in-depth study of the possible metabolites and autoxidation products of allylic alcohols is described, covering the formation, interconversion, reactivity, and sensitizing potential thereof, using a combination of in vivo, in vitro, in chemico, and in silico methods. This multimodal study, using the integration of diverse techniques to investigate the sensitization potential of a molecule, allows the identification of potential candidate(s) for the true culprit(s) in allergic responses to allylic alcohols. Overall, the sensitization potential of the investigated epoxyalcohols and unsaturated alcohols was found to derive from metabolic oxidation to the more potent aldehyde where possible. Where this is less likely, the compound remains weakly or nonsensitizing. Metabolic activation of a double bond to form a nonconjugated, nonterminal epoxide moiety is not enough to turn a nonsensitizing alcohol into a sensitizer, as such epoxides have low reactivity and low sensitizing potency. In addition, even an allylic 2,3-epoxide moiety is not necessarily a potent sensitizer, as shown for 2, where formation of the epoxide weakens the sensitization potential. /Allylic alcohols/"

C57BL/6J mice received 0.1 mL clodronate liposomes to deplete Kupffer cells or empty liposomes 48 h prior to dosing with 60 mg/kg AlOH, i.p. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by plasma ALT and histopathology.

Depletion of Kupffer cells by liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in heightened susceptibility to AlOH toxicity. Exposure to AlOH increased mRNA levels of several Mrp genes, while decreasing organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatps) mRNA expression. Protein analysis mirrored many of these mRNA changes. The presence of Kupffer cells was not required for the observed changes in uptake and efflux transporters induced by AlOH. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed enhanced Mrp4 staining exclusively in centrilobular hepatocytes of AlOH treated mice. These findings demonstrate that Kupffer cells are protective from AlOH toxicity and that induction of Mrp4 occurs in liver regions away from areas of AlOH damage independent of Kupffer cell function.

The objective of this study was to measure miR-122 together with several other liver markers in distinct settings of acute liver toxicity in rats to determine the value of miR-122 as a biomarker for liver injury in this species. Rats were exposed to 3 well-established liver toxicants (acetaminophen, allyl alcohol, and a-naphthyl isothiocyanate), a liver-enzyme inducer (phenobarbital), or a cardiotoxicant (doxorubicin). There was a clear increase in plasma miR-122 following administration of acetaminophen, allyl alcohol, and a-naphthyl isothiocyanate. The response of miR-122 paralleled that of other markers and was consistent with liver injury as indicated by histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, the changes in miR-122 were detected earlier than standard liver injury markers and exhibited a wide dynamic range. In contrast, miR-122 responses to phenobarbital and doxorubicin were low. Based on these findings, miR-122 shows significant promise and may provide added value for assessing liver toxicity in drug development."

Allyl esters with a saturated straight alkyl carboxylic acid moiety (allyl acetate, hexanoate and heptanoate as tested species, and allyl butyrate, pentanoate, octanoate, nonanoate and decanoate as untested species) are likely similar in rate of ester hydrolysis, thereby defining subcategory 1.

These yeast may grow more slowly due to slower reduction of acetaldehyde and a higher NADH/NAD(+) ratio, which should decrease the oxidation of allyl alcohol. We determined steady-state kinetic constants for three yeast ADHs with new site-directed substitutions and examined the correlation between catalytic efficiency and growth on selective media of yeast expressing six different ADHs. The H15R substitution (a test for electrostatic effects) is on the surface of ADH and has small effects on the kinetics. The H44R substitution (affecting interactions with the coenzyme pyrophosphate) was previously shown to decrease affinity for coenzymes 2-4-fold and turnover numbers (V/Et) by 4-6-fold. The W82R substitution is distant from the active site, but decreases turnover numbers by 5-6-fold, perhaps by effects on protein dynamics. The E67Q substitution near the catalytic zinc was shown previously to increase the Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde and to decrease turnover for ethanol oxidation. The W54R substitution, in the substrate binding site, increases kinetic constants (Ks, by >10-fold) while decreasing turnover numbers by 2-7-fold. Growth of yeast expressing the different ADHs on YPD plates (yeast extract, peptone and dextrose) plus antimycin to require fermentation, was positively correlated with the log of catalytic efficiency for the sequential bi reaction (V1/KiaKb=KeqV2/KpKiq, varying over 4 orders of magnitude, adjusted for different levels of ADH expression) in the order: WT~H15R>H44R>W82R>E67Q>W54R.
