Using an oxygen uptake curve made in accordance with the MITI or OECD standard test, the maximum observed rate constant for salicylic acid biodegradation was calculated to be 3.0 day-1, while the half-saturation constant was 37 mg theoretical oxygen demand/L(2). Biodegradation of salicylic acid in water was observed to decrease by a factor of 10.3 when the compound was sorbed to gamma-aluminum oxide (gamma-Al2O3). Fluorescence and 14CO2 data suggested that salicylic acid is partially protected from microbial attack in the sorbed state, and that desorption limits biodegradation in the absence of or in limited amounts of aqueous-phase substrate(3)."

            "Value": "Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically to the skin. In low concentrations, the drug has keratoplastic activity (correction of abnormal keratinization) and in higher concentrations (i.e., 1% or higher, depending on the vehicle), the drug has keratolytic activity (causes peeling of skin). Salicylic acid softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration (water concentration), probably because of decreased pH, which causes the cornified epithelium (horny layer) of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Experimental evidence suggests that the oxidative metabolites 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for the nephrotoxicity of salicylic acid. In the present study, enzymuria in conjunction with glucose and protein excretion were used as endpoints to compare the relative nephrotoxicity of salicylic acid with 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. In addition, the effect of age on enzymuria and glucose and protein excretion following treatment with salicylic acid or 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was investigated because the elderly are at greater risk for salicylic acid-induced nephrotoxicity. Three and 12-month male Fischer 344 rats were administered either no treatment, vehicle, salicylic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at 500 mg/kg p.o. in 5 mL/kg corn oil/DMSO (5:1). Effects of these treatments on functional integrity of renal tissue was assessed from 0-72 hr after dosing by measurement of urinary creatinine, glucose, and protein, as well as excretion of proximal and distal tubular renal enzymes. Enzymes measured as indicators of proximal tubular damage were N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (AP), while urinary lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured as indicators of distal tubular damage. In comparison to 3-month old vehicle-treated rats, 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid caused a significant increase between 0-8 hr in excretion of urinary glucose and activities of AST, NAG, and lactate dehydrogenase, with peak effects occurring between 4-8 hr. Toxic effects of either metabolite were not evident beyond 24 hr, and toxicity of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was significantly greater in comparison to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Salicylic acid treatment resulted in similar effects on enzymuria as well as glucose and protein excretion, but peak effects did not occur until 16-24 hr, and often persisted until 72 hr after dosing. Maximal enzymuria in response to salicylic acid treatment was significantly greater in 12- vs. 3-month rats for AST, NAG, and lactate dehydrogenase. In response to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid treatment, the maximal response was significantly greater in 12- vs. 3-month rats for lactate dehydrogenase and AST, and for NAG in response to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid treatment. The results of this study suggest that both 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid are nephrotoxic metabolites of salicylic acid, but implicate 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the more potent nephrotoxic metabolite. The relative lack of an age effect for 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid vs. salicylic acid supports the hypothesis that age-related differences in biotransformation of salicylic acid, and not increased tissue sensitivity to 2,3- or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, contribute to the age-related increase in susceptibility to salicylic acid-induced nephrotoxicity."

Bleeding at parturition was increased in four animals as compared to controls. None of the 106 pups born to these 10 animals were dead (compared to 4 of the 109 pups in the control group)."

In these embryos acute reduction of heart beat was observed during 4 hours of administration compared to that in non-treated one. Protein contents and crown-rump length of cultured embryos were significantly decreased in aspirin-treated group, but were not so decreased in salicylic acid-treated one. The predominant defects of the embryos exposed to aspirin were edematous facial malformations and abnormality of tail. On the other hand, facial anomalies such as cleft lip and curly tail were observed in the embryos cultured with salicylic acid. Anomalies induced by aspirin were systemic, while salicylic acid induced localized malformations. These results might be due to the differences between aspirin and its metabolite, salicylic acid in their teratogenicity."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Aspirin ingestion in humans and animals has been reported to lead to a range of undesirable outcomes, including fetal death, growth retardation, and congenital abnormalities. Rat embryos were cultured for 48 hr in 100-300 ug/mL of salicylic acid, a metabolite of aspirin, days 9.5-11.5 of gestation. When compared to growth in control embryos, a significant dose-dependent decrease in crown-rump lengths, somite numbers, and yolk sac diameters was observed. There was also a significant increase in overall dysmorphology, including eye, brachial arch, and heart anomalies, and an absence of forelimb buds. The neural tube was especially vulnerable and had frequently failed to close. Cellular and ultrastructural examination revealed extensive cell death in the neuroepithelium, with a lesser effect on the mesenchymal cells. Large condensed blebs projected into the ventricular lumen, and cell membranes as well as the basal lamina were severely disrupted, with all cytoplasmic organelles affected in dying cells. It is likely that the extensive cell necrosis and blebbing in the developing neuroepithelium at the site of neural tube fusion may be involved in failed neurulation, while necrosis at other sites in the cranial neuroepithelium may be linked with previously reported intellectual and behavioral abnormalities."

The salicylate effect was drastically enhanced by Zn deficiency. The increase in serum Mg2+ is probably caused by the nephrotoxicity of salicylate. The decrease of serum Ca2+ concentration is combined with an increase of parathyroid hormone concentration in serum. Probably, salicylate and Zn deficiency inhibit Ca2+ mobilization by parathyroid hormone in bone."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that salicylic acid is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of salicylic acid is 2.98(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."

            "Value": "The sorption coefficient (Kd) of salicylic acid ranges from 3.6-397 kg-1, depending on soil type. The largest coefficients have been noted for soils having greater iron oxide or aluminum oxide content(1). A study of variable charge soils found that iron oxides influenced salicylic acid adsorption more than aluminosilicate minerals, which showed only a small adsorption capacity(2). Salicylic acid has been noted to sorb strongly to iron and aluminum oxide surfaces via a surface ligand exchange reaction. The degree of sorption varies in response to the pH, surface charge, aqueous speciation of the sorbates, and other aqueous- and solid-phase phenomena(3). Results of a study utilizing attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular orbital calculations have suggested that a monodentate complex involving one carboxylate oxygen is most probable under neutral conditions; a bidentate complex involving both carboxylate oxygen atoms and two vicinal Al3+ octahedra is likely to dominate at lower pH(4)."
