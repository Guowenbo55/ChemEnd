Analysis showed it consisted of 18% demeton-O and 30% demeton-S, with the remainder being emulsifier. The emulsifier is crucial due to the low solubility of the isomers in water. Within plants, both isomers are transformed into other compounds, primarily metabolites that are effective against insects. The text also mentions comparative tests on the insecticidal effect of these compounds on aphids and the use of demeton-S containing 32P to study its uptake and distribution in plants. The emulsifier used in all solutions is described as Bayer 8139, a polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl phenol.",

Plants were initially raised in another greenhouse which was open in hot weather and heated to prevent frost in cold weather.",

Persistence was tested by attempting to reinfest treated plants on 5th or 10th day. Control untreated plants were maintained."
