Thus, the/se/  ... experiments were designed to investigate the relaxation mechanism of linalyl acetate as the major ingredient of lavender essential oil in rabbit carotid artery specimens. Linalyl acetate produced sustained and progressive relaxation during the contraction caused by phenylephrine. The relaxation effect of linalyl acetate at a concentration near the EC50 was partially but significantly attenuated by nitroarginine as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxaline-1-one as an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, or by the denudation of endothelial cells. In specimens without endothelium, the phenylephrine-induced contraction and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were significantly attenuated after the pretreatment with linalyl acetate. The relaxation caused by linalyl acetate in the endothelium-denuded specimens was clearly inhibited by calyculin A as an inhibitor of MLC phosphatase, although not by ML-9 as an inhibitor of MLC kinase. Furthermore, suppression of the phenylephrine-induced contraction and MLC phosphorylation with linalyl acetate was canceled by the pretreatment with calyculin A. These results suggest that linalyl acetate relaxes the vascular smooth muscle through partially activation of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, and partially MLC dephosphorylation via activating MLC phosphatase."

The significant decrease in the mobility of female and male laboratory animals under standardized experimental conditions is found to be closely dependent on the exposure time to the drugs. Nevertheless after an injection of caffeine into mice a hyperactivity was observed which was reduced to nearly a normal mobility only by inhalation of these fragrance drugs. In particular the correlation of the mobility of the animals to linalool in serum is experimentally proven, thus furnishing evidence of the aromatherapeutical use of herbal pillows employed in folk medicine since ancient times in order to facilitate falling asleep or to minimize stressful situations of man.[Buchbauer G et al; Z Naturforsch"

Clinical signs observed in all dose groups included depression, ataxia, urine stains, rough coat and soft feces. Labored respiration, wheezing, hunched position, and red stains on the nose and/or eyes were observed at the two highest dose groups; prostration, tremors and lacrimination were also observed at the highest dose level. Necropsy revealed discolored lungs, thickened lobes in the liver and a thick white material adhered to and covering the liver and spleen.

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ In a preliminary experiment, ... lavender essential oil relaxed vascular smooth muscle. Thus, /these/  ... experiments were designed to investigate the relaxation mechanism of linalyl acetate as the major ingredient of lavender essential oil in rabbit carotid artery specimens. Linalyl acetate produced sustained and progressive relaxation during the contraction caused by phenylephrine. The relaxation effect of linalyl acetate at a concentration near the EC50 was partially but significantly attenuated by nitroarginine as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxaline-1-one as an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, or by the denudation of endothelial cells. In specimens without endothelium, the phenylephrine-induced contraction and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were significantly attenuated after the pretreatment with linalyl acetate. The relaxation caused by linalyl acetate in the endothelium-denuded specimens was clearly inhibited by calyculin A as an inhibitor of MLC phosphatase, although not by ML-9 as an inhibitor of MLC kinase. Furthermore, suppression of the phenylephrine-induced contraction and MLC phosphorylation with linalyl acetate was canceled by the pretreatment with calyculin A. These results suggest that linalyl acetate relaxes the vascular smooth muscle through partially through activation of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, and partially MLC dephosphorylation via activating MLC phosphatase."

Analyses were performed using gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass spectrometry. Sensitizing potencies of compounds were determined using the local lymph node assay (LLNA) in mice. ... : Analyses showed that the content of linalyl acetate decreased over time on air exposure and other compounds were formed. Hydroperoxides, an epoxide and an alcohol were identified as oxidation products from linalyl acetate. In the LLNA, linalyl acetate of high purity showed a weak sensitizing potency (EC3 25%). Autoxidation increased the sensitizing potency of linalyl acetate, and a 10 weeks oxidized sample gave an EC3 value of 3.6%. As for linalool, the hydroperoxides were shown to be the oxidation products with the highest sensitizing potency. ... It is concluded that autoxidation of the weakly allergenic linalyl acetate leads to formation of allergenic oxidation products."
