These concentrations were 400 mg/cu m 1-octanol, 150 mg/cu m 1-nonanol, and 100 mg/cu m 1-decanol. Dams were weighed daily for the first week of exposure, and weekly thereafter. On gestation day 20, rats were sacrificed. Fetuses were serially removed, blotted dry, examined for external malformations, sexed, weighed, placed in appropriate fixatives, and subsequently examined for visceral or skeletal abnormalities. No treatment-related effects were observed in pregnant females, frequency of resorptions, fetal weights, or skeletal/visceral malformations. Thus, long-chain alcohols at these vapor concn appear not to be toxic as evidenced by these fetal and maternal parameters."

The n-alkanols exhibited an increased molar inhibition of the ATPase activity with an increase in the carbon chain length up to 1-octanol. 1-octanol and l-decanol caused a biphasic effect on the ATPase activity depending on the alkanol concentration, whereas l-dodecanol caused stimulation of the ATPase activity. All alkanols studied caused an increased fluidity of the membrane. Our results indicate that the effect of alkanols on the ATPase activity depends on changes in the border layer between the membrane and the surrounding medium and of the alkanols to enzyme molecule. Furthermore, the two-way effect of 1-octanol and l-decanol and stimulatory effect of 1-dodecanol indicate that more mechanisms are involved."
