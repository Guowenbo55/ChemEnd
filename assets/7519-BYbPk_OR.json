            "Value": "Using its log Kow, 2.11(2), one estimates a BCF of 24 for anisole using a recommended regression equation(3). The bioconcentration of anisole in aquatic organisms was determined in a model aquatic ecosystem maintained at 26.7 \u00b0C with 12 hr of simulated daylight exposure(1). After 24 hr exposure, the ecological magnification for anisole was (organism, bioaccumulation factor): fish, 22; mosquito larva, 27; algae, 563; daphnia, 771; snails, 899(1). There were signs of considerable metabolism in all species. O-dealkylate occurred in fish and snail, hydroxylation to o- and p-methoxyphenols occurred in all species except daphnia, and conjugation occurred in alga and snails(1). According to a recommended classification scheme(4), this BCF value and its metabolism in aquatic organisms would indicate that anisole has a low potential for bioconcentration in fish and aquatic organisms(SRC)."

Anisole was readily biodegradable in another screening test; >70% DOC and >60% BOD were removed in this test(3). Anisole completely degraded in a biodegradation test that utilized a soil inoculum(2)."

Two series of substances were used. The first were the n-aliphatic alcohols, ethanol, butanol, hexanol and octanol, and the other were flavoring /cmpd/including anisole, eugenol, estragole, and safrole derived from methoxybenzene. Low concn of each cmpd stimulated liver microsomal calcium (2+)-ATPase where as higher concn inhibited this activity. Enzyme activity was modulated by perturbation of membrane hydrophobic interactions as demonstrated by the linear relationship between equiactive concn of the cmpd and their partition coefficients. A decr in membrane order was induced by these cmpd as evidenced by measurements of electron spin resonance. ... The modification in ATPase activity was not directly related to the decr in membrane order."
