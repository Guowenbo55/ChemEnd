It is a systemic fungicide, specific to oomycetes, used on potatoes and grape vines. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a diastereoisomeric mixture, a valinamide fungicide and a carbamate fungicide. It contains a L-(R)-iprovalicarb and a L-(S)-iprovalicarb.",

The fungicide controlled all developmental stages of the pathogen, with iprovalicarb providing the protective effect. Melody Duo showed similar efficacy to metalaxyl-containing Apron 35 sd and Ridomil 72 MZ wp for protective activity and exceeded them for eradicant activity at comparable doses. Iprovalicarb exhibited excellent curative activity and was translocated acropetally, leading to the recovery of downy mildewed pearl millet plants after foliar treatments. The study recommends the use of Melody Duo 66.75 wp against pearl millet downy mildew disease.",
