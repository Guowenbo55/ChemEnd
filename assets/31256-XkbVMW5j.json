The solvents were tested in bacterial mutation assays, a yeast assay for mitotic gene conversion and in cultured mammalian cells (either rat liver or Chinese hamster ovary) for structural chromosome damage. All of the solvents gave a negative response in the bacterial mutation assays and the yeast mitotic gene conversion assay. In the rat liver chromosome assay, diacetone alcohol evoked a weak positive response, the remaining solvents gave a negative response."
