    "Description": "Hexanal is a saturated fatty aldehyde that is hexane in which one of the terminal methyl group has been mono-oxygenated to form the corresponding aldehyde. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite. It is a saturated fatty aldehyde, a n-alkanal and a medium-chain fatty aldehyde. It derives from a hydride of a hexane.",

In atherosclerosis inhibition of cell-cell communication by atherogenic compounds, e.g., low density lipoproteins (LDL), also seems to be important. For testing atherogenic compounds we used an atherosclerosis relevant cell type, namely human smooth muscle cells. In order to investigate which part of the LDL particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic co-operation between human smooth muscle cells in culture ... several fatty acids and their breakdown products /were tested/, namely aldehydes. Unsaturated C-18 fatty acids markedly influenced gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), whereas saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated fatty acids with > 20 carbon atoms did not inhibit GJIC. In the case of oleic and elaidic acid, orientation seemed important; however, after exposure to palmitoleic and palmitelaidic acid no differences were found. The most potent inhibitor of GJIC was linoleic acid, which inhibited GJIC by 75%. No correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit GJIC. Of the tested aldehydes, hexanal, propanal, butanal and 4-hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit GJIC, while pentanal had no effect. Since modification of LDL was shown to be important in order for LDL to inhibit GJIC, these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of GJIC by LDL."

Hexanal strongly affects the release of dopamine from rat striatal slices and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In this study, we attempted to clarify the mechanism underlying the regulation of dopamine release by hexanal by using PC12 cells, which have the ability to synthesize, store, and release dopamine. The stimulation of PC12 cells with hexanal enhanced dopamine release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Dopamine release was partially inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator. In addition, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was found to slowly increase after hexanal stimulation. Furthermore, the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 partially inhibited hexanal-induced dopamine release. However, the levels of phosphorylated proteins decreased after hexanal stimulation. Hexanal stimulated the release of only a small amount of dopamine from reserpine-treated PC12 cells, in which the vesicular dopamine was depleted. These findings suggest that both an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated proteins might be required for hexanal-stimulated release of dopamine, and that the dopamine released because of hexanal stimulation mainly comes from the dopamine vesicles. This study showed the cellular events that occurred in PC12 cells after stimulation of hexanal. Furthermore, it is important to examine the relationship between the cellular functions and the physiological effects of hexanal on dopamine release."

It has been reported that certain green odor compounds enhance dopamine release from rat brain striatal slices and rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells). It is well known that intracellular Ca(2+) levels regulate dopamine release. The amount of dopamine released by n-hexanal-treated PC12 cells decreased in cells pretreated with a membrane-permeable Ca(2+) chelator. In this study, the effect of n-hexanal on dopamine release in the brain striatum of living rats was studied using an in vivo brain microdialysis system. Local stimulation with n-hexanal diluted in Ringer's solution to 0.01%, 0.05%, or 0.1% enhanced dopamine release in a concentration-dependent manner. The amount of dopamine released with 0.01% n-hexanal administration significantly declined when either extracellular or intracellular Ca(2+) levels decreased. Furthermore, the extracellular dopamine concentration increased with perfusion of nomifensine, an inhibitor of dopamine uptake into cells. When nomifensine was co-perfused with n-hexanal into the striatum, extracellular dopamine release increased further. Accordingly, the concentration of dopamine metabolite and the ratio of dopamine metabolite to dopamine decreased after treatment with n-hexanal. These responses were similar to those seen with KCl stimulation. These data suggest that n-hexanal stimulates dopamine release but does not inhibit dopamine uptake in the brain striatum of living rats, and that dopamine release associated with n-hexanal is regulated by both extracellular and intracellular Ca(2+) levels."

            "Value": "The Koc of hexaldehyde is estimated as 50(SRC), using a log Kow of 1.78(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that hexaldehyde is expected to have high mobility in soil."
