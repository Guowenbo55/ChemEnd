Several hormonal and growth factor supplements were assessed for their ability to promote growth (increased protein and DNA content) and stability of differentiated phenotype (high activities of ?-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase as brush-border membrane markers in PT cells; maintenance of high activities of glutamate dehydrogenase as a mitochondrial marker in both PT and DT cells; maintenance of low and high activities of lactate dehydrogenase in PT and DT cells, respectively; expression of cytokeratins). Basal supplemented media (DMEM/F12, 1:1 v/v) contained insulin, hydrocortisone, epidermal growth factor, sodium selenite and transferrin as supplements. Additionally, triiodothyronine selectively promoted growth and stability of differentiated phenotype in PT cells and thyrocalcitonin selectively promoted growth and stability of differentiated phenotype in DT cells. On Day 3 of primary culture, PT and DT cells were incubated for up to 8 hr with either ten-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH; 0.5-100 mM), methyl vinyl ketone (MVK; 1-10 mM), or p-aminophenol (PAP; 1-10 mM) and cellular injury, as assessed by cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase, was determined. DT cells were significantly more susceptible to injury from both tBH and MVK, but the two cell populations were equally susceptible to injury from PAP, which is the same susceptibility pattern seen in freshly isolated cells. These results suggest that primary cultures of rat renal PT and DT cells reflect similar biochemical properties as freshly isolated cells and are, therefore, useful models for study of chemically induced injury.[Lash LH et al; Toxicology 103 (2): 85-103 (1995)]"

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Patterns of chemical-induced cytotoxicity in different regions of the nephron were studied with freshly isolated proximal tubular and distal tubular cells from rat kidney. Three model alkylating agents, methyl vinyl ketone, allyl alcohol, and N-dimethylnitrosamine, were used as test chemicals. Methyl vinyl ketone and a metabolite of allyl alcohol, acrolein, are Michael acceptors that bind to cellular protein sulfhydryl groups and GSH. N-Dimethylnitrosamine binds to cellular protein and DNA. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage was used to assess irreversible cellular injury. Distal tubular cells were more susceptible than proximal tubular cells to injury produced by methyl vinyl ketone or allyl alcohol while the two cell populations were equally susceptible to injury produced by N-dimethylnitrosamine. Preincubation of both proximal tubular and distal tubular cells with GSH protected them from methyl vinyl ketone- and allyl alcohol-induced cytotoxicity but had no effect on N-dimethylnitrosamine-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, incubation of cells with methyl vinyl ketone or allyl alcohol, but not N-dimethylnitrosamine, altered cellular GSH status. As with GSH status, incubation of cells with methyl vinyl ketone or allyl alcohol, but not N-dimethylnitrosamine, caused pronounced inhibitory effects on mitochondrial function, as evidenced by ATP depletion and inhibition of cellular oxygen consumption. These results demonstrate that alkylating agents are cytotoxic to both proximal tubular and distal tubular cells, and that interaction with cellular GSH is a factor determining nephron cell type specificity of injury.[Lash LH, Woods EB; Arch Biochem Biophys 286 (1): 46-56 (1991)]"

Addition of the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole does not significantly influence the genotoxicity indicating that it is unlikely that the solvent effect depends on competitive inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase by the alcohols used as solvents.

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of methyl vinyl ketone can be estimated to be 3.8(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that methyl vinyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility in soil."
