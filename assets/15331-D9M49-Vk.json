            "content": "The study investigated the effects of droplet size and carrier volume on the foliar uptake and transport of daminozide, a plant growth regulator. The experiment used Phaseolus vulgaris (cv Nerina), specifically the primary leaves of 10-day-old plants. A constant dose of daminozide (100 mg) was applied to both primary leaves using droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 10 ml and carrier volumes ranging from 10 to 200 ml per leaf. The results showed that decreasing droplet size or increasing carrier volume led to reduced penetration of daminozide into the leaves. However, it increased the translocation of daminozide within the plant. When the logarithm of the leaf surface/droplet interface area was plotted against daminozide uptake, a negative linear relationship was observed. This means that as the interface area decreased, daminozide uptake decreased as well. On the other hand, for translocation, an optimum quadratic relationship was observed. There was an optimal range of interface area that resulted in the highest translocation of daminozide within the plant. Some phytotoxicity (toxic effects on plants) was observed at low carrier volumes and large droplet sizes. The severity of phytotoxicity was positively correlated with the amount of daminozide deposited per unit wetted area above a threshold of 0.7 mg daminozide per square millimeter. Below this threshold, no visual evidence of phytotoxicity was observed. Interestingly, the maximum in the relationship between translocation and interface area closely corresponded to the threshold amount of deposit above which phytotoxicity occurred. This suggests that the inverse relationship between daminozide uptake and translocation at low interface areas may be attributed to the occurrence of phytotoxicity.",

Initial penetration time course was established by harvesting plants at 0, 1, 4, 8, 24, 72, and 168 hours. Plants were treated with 10 x 1-ml droplets per leaf of a 10 g/l solution of daminozide. Recovery of radioactivity averaged 94.6%. Effects of droplet size (1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-ml droplets) and carrier volume (10 to 200 ml per leaf) were studied at constant daminozide dose (100 mg per leaf) in a complete factorial design. Daminozide concentrations for 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 ml per leaf volumes were 10, 5, 2, 1, and 0.5 g/l, respectively. Carrier volume was adjusted by varying droplet number."
