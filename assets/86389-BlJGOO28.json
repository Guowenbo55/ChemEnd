    "Description": "Thifluzamide is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazole-5-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 2,6-dibromo-4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline. Used to control Rhizoctonia spp. diseases on rice, potatoes, maize, grass and other crops. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aromatic amide, an aromatic ether, an organofluorine compound, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a dibromobenzene and an anilide fungicide.",

Foliage spray, the most common method, has drawbacks such as evaporation and drift. By studying pesticide absorption and conductivity and selecting suitable pesticides for root application, the adverse effects of environmental factors on pesticide ingredients can be reduced. The results suggest that tricyclazole is best suited for root application, showing superior upward transmission in rice seedlings compared to the other fungicides. This research provides guidance for pesticide selection for root application and contributes to the scientific use of pesticides.",
