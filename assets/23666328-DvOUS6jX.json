Groups of 2 or 4 mice of the same age were given single oral doses of either 1.0 or 3.0 g/kg L-glutamic acid or monosodium-L-aspartate or 3.0 g/kg L-glutamate-L-aspartate, monosodium glutamate, NaCl, L-glycine, L-serine, L-alanine, L-leucine, D,L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, L-lysine, L-arginine, or L-cysteine. The animals were sacrificed after dosing and brains were examined by either light or electron microscopy. The severity of brain damage was estimated by quantifying the pathological changes in the hypothalamus. One g/kg of glutamic acid destroyed approximately the same number of hypothalamic neurons as a comparable dose of MSG. Of the amino acids tested, only aspartate and cysteine produced hypothalamic damage. These amino acids caused both retinal and hypothalamic lesions similar to those found after treatment with MSG."

When a 4 g/kg dose was given intragastrically, convulsions were seldom observed, and then only after 90 minutes. Two g/kg MSG given intraperitoneally always caused convulsions. When young rats were given 4 g/kg MSG, monosodium aspartate, or glycine, the glutamine level was increased significantly in the brain in all cases, but only monosodium glutamate and aspartate caused convulsions. D-Glutamate (4 g/kg), which is not deaminated by the rat, also caused convulsions. These results suggest that the convulsions caused by MSG are not due to liberated ammonia, but rather to the amino acid anion. At 4 g/kg, MSG gave rise to serum concentrations of glutamate of about 70 mM, strongly suggesting osmotic problems."

The histological picture of the thyroid gland remains unchanged for the animals sacrificed after short-term (13 weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) treatment. MSG, therefore, has a cumulative effect.

Other maternal mice were given po MSG (2.5 mg/g or 4.0 mg/g bw) at 17-21 days of pregnancy, and their offspring behaviors studied. The results showed that maternal oral administration of MSG at a late stage of pregnancy decreased the threshold of convulsion in the litters at 10 days of age. Y-maze discrimination learning was significantly impaired in the 60-day-old filial mice. On the other hand, no significant difference in spatial learning or tail flick latency was measured between the experimental animals and the controls. The filial mice of MSG-treated mothers could either not grasp a rope tightly, or grasped the rope tightly but could not crawl along the rope at the beginning of the training. However, such mice, after training, could grasp and crawl along the rope as well as controls. Obvious neuronal damage was not detected in the periventricular organs or the hypothalamus under a light microscope. The rate of weight gain for experimental animals was greater than for controls throughout the period from 20 to 90 days.

MSG treatment produced a significant reduction in synaptosomal uptake of dopamine (DA), choline (Ch) and GABA when expressed in terms of hypothalamic wet weight. However, MSG treatment resulted in a significant loss (70%) of synaptosomal protein and consequent increases in synaptosomal uptake of these neurochemicals when expressed per unit of synaptosomal protein. The results indicate that MSG treatment produced an overall reduction in net hypothalamic uptake, with surviving neuronal elements exhibiting an increased uptake which may reflect compensatory changes in these nerve terminals.

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) was injected intraperitoneally into goldfish at a dosage of 2.5 mg/g body weight. At 24 hr post-injection there was a marked hypertrophy and edema in the region of the nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT) from the anterior margin of the pituitary stalk through to the posterior end of the NLT, irrespective of the sex of the goldfish. A similar hypertrophy and edema occurred ventral to the anterior commissure in the preoptic region in the anterior-ventral nucleus preopticus periventricularis (NPP). At 6 hr post-injection a slight vacuolization was evident in these two regions, and at two days the hypertrophy and edema had abated from the extent observed at 24 hr post-injection. At five and eight days post-injection only necrotic cells were found in the affected NLT region, but only a small band of necrotic cells was evident in the anterior-ventral preoptic region. No other brain lesions were evident. Serum levels of gonadotropin (GtH) were increased at 6 hr, 24 hr, and two days after treatment with MSG, but were similar to control values at five, seven and eight days after MSG in male and female goldfish. Exocytosis of small dark secretory granules in gonadotrophs was evident at 24 hr after MSG in a fish with a somewhat greater increase in serum GtH than usually found. The time course of increased serum GtH levels postinjection of MSG is consistent with the observed time course of hypertrophy and atrophy of NLT neurons; the increase in serum levels of GtH is interpreted to reflect a stimulation of release of GtH-releasing factor from neurons in the NLT. Electron microscope investigation indicates that prolactin cells have increased secretory and synthetic activity from 24 hr through to seven days post-injection of MSG. The mechanism for stimulation of the prolactin cells by MSG is not known. No other changes in activity of adenohypophysial secretory cells were found."

Neonatal rats were injected with monosodium glutamate (4 mg/g body weight) or 10% sodium chloride (controls) on alternate days for the first 10 days of life. Females were ovariectomized on day 45 of age, and all rats were used between 60 and 80 days of age.

The tyrosine hydroxylase immunostainings of the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons perikarya in the arcuate nucleus and of the nerve terminals in the median eminence were qualitatively more intense in females than males. The catalytic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, as determined by in vitro DOPA accumulation in the stalk median eminence, was 3 fold greater in females than males.

The present study investigated the developmental sequelae of monosodium glutamate induced alterations in hypothalamic monoamine metabolism as well as other aspects of monosodium glutamate toxicity. Female rats given 4 mg/kg of monosodium glutamate on postnatal days 2 and 4 did not exhibit any significant alterations in hypothalamic monoamine metabolism on postnatal days 21 or 30, however, postpubertal monosodium glutamate treated females had signifiantly reduced levels of mediobasal hypothalamic dopamine and DOPAC. In contrast, male monosodium glutamate treated rats had slight reductions in hypothalamic and mediobasal hypothalamic dopamine levels but these reductions were not statistically significant. Male monosodium glutamate treated rats did exhibit significant reductions in hypothalamic DOPAC on postnatal day 30 and mediobasal hypothalamic homovanillic acid levels on day 100. Acetylcholine levels were also measured in the mediobasal hypothalamic and pituitary of adult male monosodium glutamate treated rats and found to be unaltered. The developmental profile of hypothalamic monoamines and their metabolites and monosodium glutamate induced alterations in dopamine and DOPOAC levels in the mediobasal hypothalamic of female rats are discussed in relation to the neurochemical mechanisms involved in triggering puberty."

At the tenth postnatal day, the retina showed a rapid response and progression of changes. Within 30 min of a single subcutaneous injection, morphologic changes were evident, and massive edema of the inner portions of the retina developed within 90 min, increasing the thickness of the whole retina by 40 to 60% in several hr.

In this condition, impairment of the hyperglycemic and food intake responses, associated to a lower increase in plasma FFA levels, were observed.

After NEO, plasma glucose increased only in the MSG group, while plasma FFA levels were elevated in the C rats.
