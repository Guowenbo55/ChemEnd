            "Value": "Of 107 fish sampled from various lakes and rivers in Ontario, Canada, only 17 contained tetraalkyl lead compounds at a detectable level(1).

The mean concentrations in 8 whole fish samples of combined samples of white sucker, 1983 samples date, and carp and white sucker, 1984 sample date, from the St. Clair River, Ontario, Canada were 10 and 20 ng/g, respectively(2). Methyltriethyl lead was detected in whole fish samples from the St. Lawrence River (collected near Maitland, Ontario) at concentrations of 142 (carp); 146-169 (pike); 293 (white sucker); and 187-252 (smallmouth bass) ng/g wet weight(3). In another study conducted in summer 1983, methyltriethyl lead was detected in 5 out of 16 whole fish samples from the St. Lawrence River and in 1 out of 14 whole fish samples from the St. Clair River in Ontario, Canada; concentrations in the positive samples were 144-4,402 and 57 ng/g wet wt, respectively(4)."

Methyltriethyl lead levels were below 0.06 ng Pb/g in sediment collected from Colchester, UK in 1986(1). Analysis of roadside dust, roadside soil and sediment from various locations in England for alkylleads found methyltriethyl lead concentrations varying from below detection limits (0.06 ng Pb/g) to 38 ng Pb/g(4)."
