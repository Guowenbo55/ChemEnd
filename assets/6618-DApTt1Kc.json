    "Description": "3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobisphenol A is a bromobisphenol that is 4,4'-methanediyldiphenol in which the methylene hydrogens are replaced by two methyl groups and the phenyl rings are substituted by bromo groups at positions 2, 2', 6 and 6'. It is a brominated flame retardant. It is a brominated flame retardant and a bromobisphenol. It is functionally related to a bisphenol A.",

In 12 sediment samples collected from Taihu Lake, China (the third largest freshwater lake in China that is surrounded by highly developed cities and towns) in Sept 2010, 2,2',6,6'-tetrabromobisphenol A was detected at a concentration range of 0.056-2.15 ng/g dry wt(7).
