    "Description": "L-proline is pyrrolidine in which the pro-S hydrogen at position 2 is substituted by a carboxylic acid group. L-Proline is the only one of the twenty DNA-encoded amino acids which has a secondary amino group alpha to the carboxyl group. It is an essential component of collagen and is important for proper functioning of joints and tendons. It also helps maintain and strengthen heart muscles. It has a role as a micronutrient, a nutraceutical, an algal metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a member of compatible osmolytes. It is a glutamine family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a proline and a L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a L-prolinium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-prolinate. It is an enantiomer of a D-proline. It is a tautomer of a L-proline zwitterion.",

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ During fermentation processes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are exposed to multiple stresses, including a high concentration of ethanol that represents toxicity through intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. We previously reported that proline protected yeast cells from damage caused by various stresses, such as freezing and ethanol. As an antioxidant, proline is suggested to scavenge intracellular ROS. In this study, we examined the role of intracellular proline during ethanol treatment in S. cerevisiae strains that accumulate different concentrations of proline. When cultured in YPD medium, there was a significant accumulation of proline in the put1 mutant strain, which is deficient in proline oxidase, in the stationary phase. Expression of the mutant PRO1 gene, which encodes the gamma-glutamyl kinase variant (Asp154Asn or Ile150Thr) with desensitization to feedback inhibition by proline, in the put1 mutant strain showed a prominent increase in proline content, as compared with that of the wild-type strain. The oxidation level was clearly increased in wild-type cells after exposure to ethanol, indicating that the generation of ROS occurred. Interestingly, proline accumulation significantly reduces the ROS level and increases the survival rate of yeast cells in the stationary phase under ethanol stress conditions. However, there was not a clear correlation between proline content and survival rate in yeast cells. An appropriate level of intracellular proline in yeast might be important for its stress-protective effect. Hence, the engineering of proline metabolism could be promising for breeding stress-tolerant industrial yeast strains."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The fast as well as the slow contractions of the adductor muscle in the claw of Procambarus clarkii are inhibited by L-proline. This inhibition is dose dependent and decreases with increasing frequency of stimulation of the \"slow\" fiber. Contractions caused by perfusing the adductor muscle with L-glutamate solutions are also inhibited by L-proline. The inhibiting potency of L-proline is small; the effective concentration of this amino acid is 50-100 times that of the L-glutamate applied. It was postulated that the inhibitory effect of L-proline is based on competition for excitatory receptor sites of L-glutamate, which causes depolarization and contraction, and L-proline, which lacks these actions. Theoretical considerations suggested a linear relationship between the stimulating L-glutamate and the just-inhibiting L-proline concentrations. Experimental evidence supported this model."
