Using its log Kow of 1.66(3), one would estimate a BCF of 11 for N-methylaniline using a recommended regression equation(4). This would indicate that N-methylaniline would not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC)."

            "Value": "The BOD of N-methylaniline in coarse-filtered Lake Superior harbor water over the course of 20 days was not sufficiently different from controls to calculate a degradation rate(1). Little BOD resulted when N-methylaniline was incubated at 21 \u00b0C for 20 days in ground water, river water, or Lake Superior Harbor water(1). In a continuous biological treatment simulation test, complete DOC removal was achieved(3). N-Methylaniline (100 ppm) was moderately biodegradable in an activated sludge test with 42% total organic carbon removed(2). The test solution and acclimation procedure employed attempted to simulate industrial wastewater treated at the Fukashiba treatment plant in Japan. Aberrant behavior of N-methylaniline in a semi-continuous activated sludge (SCAS) biodegradation test was found to result from inadequate acclimation of the inoculum(4). It was degraded by Alcalignes sp. and Corynebacterium sp., both isolated from the activated sludge(4)."

            "Value": "In a 21-day biodegradation using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum, 82% mineralization and 99.9% primary degradation was obtained(6). It was found that degradation was faster when acclimation was performed in a single flask, rather than by an enrichment procedure(6). Results of standard aerobic biodegradability tests for N-methylaniline include: 92% Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in 8 days in the Zahn-Wellens test; 29 and 67% DOC removal after 28 and 42 days, respectively in the French AFNOR test(2); 46% CO2 produced and 92% DOC removed in 28 days after 14 days acclimation (Sturm test)(1); 17% DOC removal after 19 days in the OECD Screening test(1); 38% Theoretical BOD was obtained in a 5-day test(5); 18-20% Theoretical BOD was expended after 5-8 days in a respiratory test using 500 ppm of the test substance(3); 0% Theoretical BOD in 30 days with a drop of sewage as an inoculum(1); 3% BODT in 14 days in the MITI test(1); 8% mineralization to CO2 occurred in a 21-day test using an activated sludge inoculum(4). The test results suggest that N-methylaniline will biodegrade when the degrading microorganisms are acclimated(SRC)."

            "Value": "Since the pKa of N-methylaniline is 4.848(2), N-methylaniline will be partially ionized at acidic environmental pHs and its adsorption to soil would be expected to be pH-dependent(SRC). The Koc for N-methylaniline predicted from molecular structure is 65(3). According to a suggested classification scheme(5), this estimated Koc suggests that N- methylaniline will be highly mobile in soil(SRC). Batch equilibrium studies used to determine the adsorption isotherms for N-methylaniline to a Podzol (4.85% OC pH 2.8), an Alfisol (1.25% OC, pH 6.7) and a sediment (1.58% OC, pH 7.1) yielded the results (soil, Freundlich adsorption constants (Kf), Freundlich exponent (1/n), Koc): Podzol, 22.29, 0.89, 460; Alfisol, 0.59, 0.78, 47; Sediment, 1.12, 0.77, 71(1). N-Methylaniline will be almost completely ionized at the pH of the Podzol and therefore ionic interactions may be dominant(1,SRC). N-Methylaniline reacts slowly with humates possibly by adding to quinoidal structures in the humic substances(4). Covalent bond formation is inferred by the lack of extractability of the aniline from the humic material as well as reactions with model compounds(4)."
