BCFs measured in the soft tissue of freshwater mussel, Anodonta anatina, ranged from 49 to 156; depuration half-lives in the soft tissue were generally less than 24 hours(4).

            "Value": "2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol persisted for >72 days in a laboratory test with a soil inoculum; halophenols which had substituents meta to the phenol group were resistant to biodegradation(1). Another study reported that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol disappeared from soil to a large degree in 4 weeks(6). Fungi that attack conifer heartwood(2) as well as those found in litter shavings in chicken houses(3) have been reported to degrade 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol. A bacterium acclimated to pentachlorophenol was able to also utilize 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol as a growth substrate(4). The removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in kraft pulp mill/bleach plant effluent was far superior in an anaerobic reactor (83% with a 12 hr retention time) than in an aerated lagoon (33%, retention time 14 days) or an activated sludge plant (25%)(5). 2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol, concn 100 mg/l, reached 7% of its theoretical BOD over 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(7). High-rate operation (5h; 350 to 480 mg chlorophenol/l/d) of an aerobic fluidized-bed reactor resulted in a 99.6% mean removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol over a period of 235 days(8). 100% removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed in aerobic enrichment cultures following 8 days incubation(8). Over a 407-day study period, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was detected in the effluent of a sewage treatment plant in Karkola, Finland employing activated sludge at a mean concn of 6.4 ug/l; mean concns of 13,000 and 1.4 ug/l were detected in the fed groundwater and dewatered sludge, respectively(9)."

            "Value": "The chlorophenols ... act at the sites of adenosine triphosphate production and decrease or block it without blocking the electron transport chain. Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted. /Chlorophenols/"

            "Value": "Koc values for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in river sediment, lake sediment and aquifer material ranged from 6040 to 7690; average value of 6640(1). The Koc of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is estimated as approximately 6300(SRC), using a log Kow of 4.45(2) and a regression-derived equation(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). In natural waters of low ionic strength and pH below approximately 6.4, the adsorption is dominated by the partitioning of the undissociated phenol between the aqueous phase and the organic phase contained in the sediment. However, at higher pH's, the contribution of the phenolate ion cannot be neglected(1). There is strong evidence that the adsorption of the phenolate species is also predominately a partitioning between the aqueous phase and organic matter in the sorbent and is dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase(1). An equilibrium partition coefficient (Kp) of 1.8 was determined in batch equilibrium experiments using soil and groundwater (pH 10) from Alkali Lake, OR(7). In a laboratory experiment, 40% of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol sorbed to Weser estuary (Germany) sediment after 21 hr incubation at 14.5 \u00b0C; 65% was desorbed from the loaded sediment after another 21 hr(5). In contrast the partition ratios of 2,3,4,6- and/or 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol between sediment/water and suspended matter/water from the Weser estuary were 38 and 6.3, respectively(5). In the Rhine River (The Netherlands) the median sediment to water ratio of tetrachlorophenol was 24(6). Log Kom values ranging from 1.275 to 2.750 were measured for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in 14 different soil and sediment samples; mean log Kom for anionic 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was 2.431(8). Freundlich sorption coefficients of 2.173, 6.373, 2.203, and 6.392 were measured in quartz (pH 7.5), calcite (pH 7.2), kaolinite (pH 7.0), and montmorillonite (pH 5.3), respectively(9). Sorption of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was negligible to two surface soils containing 2.8 and 2.1% organic matter, and in samples of deeper sediment layers, consisting of 92 to 98% clay and silt and 0.5 to 8.4% organic matter; a Kd value of 16.7 was measured in a surface soil sample containing 12.2% organic matter(10). Kf values of 95 and 85 were determined in Holten soil (6.1% organic matter and 2.4% clay) and Kooyenburg soil (3.7% organic matter and 1.4% clay), respectively)(11)."
