Experimental conditions were the same as in the 16-day study. The death of five rats was attributed to rupture caused by the gavage procedure. Gavage related deaths were considered to result from the trauma of the gavage procedure combined with the neurotoxic/anesthetic effect of the compound. Aside from these, four male rats and one female of the 800-mg/kg group, as well as one female of the 400-mg/kg group and one male of the 200-mg/kg group died on study. The 800-mg/kg group had signs of neurotoxicity, including staggering, labored breathing, and lethargy after dosing. Blood around the nose and mouth was noted in 5 of 10 males of this group after week 8. Compared to vehicle controls, final mean body weights were 7% and 5% smaller, respectively, in male and female rats of the highest dose group. At histopathologic evaluation, lesions observed in rats of the highest dose group included necrosis of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in 7 of 7 males and 9 of 9 females; skeletal muscle necrosis in 5 of 10 males, thymic congestion, hemorrhage, and atrophy in 8 of 10 males, and nephrosis in 6 of 9 males.

Third-instar larvae trans-heterozygous for two genetic markers mwh and flr, were treated at different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 25 and 50 mM) of the test compounds. Wings of the emerging adult flies were scored for the presence of spots of mutant cells, which can result from either somatic mutation or mitotic recombination. Also lethal doses of benzyl derivatives used as flavor ingredients were determined in the experiments. For the evaluation of genotoxic effects, the frequencies of spots per wing in the treated series were compared to the control group, which is distilled water."

Benzyl alcohol was tested at doses of 0.1, 0.333, 1.0, 3.333, 5.0, and 6.666 mg/plate in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of rat or hamster liver S-9. The highest ineffective dose tested without toxicity in any S. typhimurium strains was 5.0 mg/plate. Slight inhibition of the background bacterial lawn occurred in cultures at 6.666 mg/plate but no significant change was seen in the results."

In the mouse L5178Y/TK+/- lymphoma assay, benzyl alcohol induced an increase in trifluorothymidine (Tft)-resistant cells in the absence, but not in the presence, of S9; the effect was associated with toxicity. In cytogenetic assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, treatment with benzyl alcohol produced an increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) which was judged to be equivocal both with and without S9; a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after exposure to benzyl alcohol in the presence, but not the absence, of S9."

The activities of erythrocyte-bound p-nitrophenylphosphatase and acetylcholinesterase were increased at some concentrations of benzyl alcohol and inhibited by others. The effect on cell membranes was considered the mechanism by which benzyl alcohol inhibited lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis in vitro. Benzyl alcohol induced time-, dose-, and temperature-dependent hemolysis of erythrocytes."

An experimental Koc of 15 was determined for benzyl alcohol on a red-brown Australian soil (1.09% organic carbon)(2,3). A log Koc of 1.43 has also been reported(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these Koc values suggest that benzyl alcohol is expected to have very high mobility in soil."
