Administration of ursodeoxycholate reduces serum liver enzymes in chronic liver diseases but the nature of this effect is still unclear. Using alcohol metabolising enzymes as cellular markers, the hepatotoxic properties of hydrophobic bile salts and the putative hepatoprotective effect of ursodeoxycholate was examined. Two animal models of biliary retention, bile duct obstruction and choledochocaval fistula was used to investigate the effect of taurocholate on the hepatic alcohol metabolizing enzymes: cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase before and after the infusion of taurocholic acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid for two days period. Bile duct obstruction was found to be similar to or slightly exceeds choledochocaval fistula in the degree of retention. Following the taurocholic acid infusion, the serum alcohol dehydrogenase activity as well as microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and aldehyde dehydrogenase were greatly increased but the level of cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase activities was found to be lower in either or both models in comparison with the control animals. However, the tauroursodeoxycholic acid infusion did not induce any significant changes in the levels of all the alcohol metabolizing enzyme activities in either or both models. These findings suggest that hydrophobic taurocholic acid (7alpha) affects the plasmalemma to allow leakage of cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase into the blood circulation, stimulates the biosynthesis of microsomal ethanol oxidizing system and aldehyde dehydrogenase, and suppresses the biosynthesis of alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase. But in contrast, the hydrophilic tauroursodeoxycholic acid (7beta) provided hepatoprotective effect."

We measured apoA-I expression in mice, hamsters, and rats treated with highly potent and selective synthetic FXR agonists or with TCA. All of the synthetic agonists bound to FXR with high affinity in a scintillation proximity assay. However, TCA did not compete with the radio ligand up to the highest concentration used (100 uM). The C-site regulatory region of apoA-I, through which FXR has been reported to regulate its expression, is completely conserved across the species investigated. In both male and female human apoA-I-transgenic mice, we reproduced the previously reported strong inhibition of human apoA-I expression upon treatment with the typical supraphysiological dose of TCA used in such studies. However, in contrast to some previous reports, TCA did not repress murine apoA-I expression in the same mice. Also, more-potent and -selective FXR agonists did not affect human or murine apoA-I expression in this model. In LDL receptor-deficient mice and Golden Syrian hamsters, selective FXR agonists did not affect apoA-I expression, whereas in Wistar rats, some even increased apoA-I expression. In conclusion, selective FXR agonists do not repress apoA-I expression in rodents. Repression of human apoA-I expression by TCA in transgenic mice is probably mediated through FXR-independent mechanisms."

The aim of the present study was to gain information on the effects of MOCP on the maturation of pathways involved in protein secretion into bile in young (4-week-old) rats. The amount of hepatic alpha-tubulin and the structure of the microtubular network were apparently not affected by MOCP. HRP (horseradish peroxidase) was used as a model protein, and its secretion into bile after administration through the jugular vein was measured. In adult (8-week-old) rats, two peaks of HRP output into bile were observed following administration: an early peak presumably due to paracellular transfer, and a late peak presumably due to transcytosis. In young rats (4 weeks old), the early peak was similar to that of adult animals, and was not affected by MOCP. However, the late peak was markedly smaller in young control rats, and was further reduced by MOCP. Brefeldin A decreased, whereas taurocholate did not change, the early peak, whereas both affected the transcytotic transport of HRP. Brefeldin A delayed HRP secretion (similarly in control and MOCP groups), without affecting cumulative output, whereas taurocholate accelerated the transcytotic transport of HRP in the control group, but not in the MOCP group. These results suggest that MOCP affects the maturation of hepatocyte mechanisms involved in the transcytotic secretion of HRP into bile."

Primary cultures of neonatal rat myocardial cells were established and divided into 3 treatment groups (taurocholate 0.3 uM, glycocholate 0.3 uM, and media alone control , n = 20). The effects of taurocholate and glycocholate on cultured myocardial cell viability were studied by means of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT)/formazan assay. The contractility and morphology of myocardial cells were measured by inverted and transmission electron microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0, Student-Newman- Keuls test (mean +/- standard deviation). Contractility rate of cells was significantly decreased in the taurocholate group (30.9 +/- 6.3 beats/min) compared with the glycocholate group (68.8 +/- 8.1 beats/min) and control (70.2 +/- 6.2 beats/min) (P < .001). No change in morphology was observed between groups. Taurocholate caused a gradual decrease in formazan optical density (OD). The OD at 1 hour was significantly lower than at baseline(0.1497 +/- 0.0130 versus 0.2337 +/- 0.0503, P < .05). The OD in the taurocholate group was significantly lower than OD in the glycocholate group at 1 hour (P < .05). In this in vitro model, taurocholate significantly reduces the viability and contractility of myocardial cells compared with glycocholate. The raised levels of the bile acid taurocholate in maternal serum may explain the increased risk of sudden intrauterine fetal death observed with cholestasis of pregnancy."

Taurocholic acid (TCA), as a kind of natural bioactive substance of animal bile acid, has medicinal applications to treat a wide range of inflammatory diseases. The study was designed to evaluate the effects of TCA on cytokine secretion, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta and on the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+), which is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of TCA on immunoregulation preliminarily, and also will benefit our further research. The gene and protein expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta were measured by real time RT-PCR and ELISA in serum, spleen and lymphocytes respectively. The ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) in peripheral blood and lymphocytes was measured by flow cytometry. The study has shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cyclosporin A (CsA) could increase or decrease the gene and protein expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta respectively. TCA (0.25g/kg, 0.125g/kg) could recover the suppressed expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta and increase the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+). In vitro, TCA (15ug/mL) could inhibit the increased production of TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta; TCA (0.15ug/mL-15ug/mL) could inhibit the increased gene expressions of IL-1Beta and TNF-alpha. TCA (0.15ug/mL) could recover the suppressed expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1Beta.

Reabsorption is mediated by the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ASBT, which is localized in the brush border membranes of proximal tubular cells. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether tubular taurocholate transport is regulated by sex hormones. Clearance studies and studies on proximal tubular cells freshly isolated from rat kidneys were performed. The studies with the isolated proximal tubular cells revealed a cell to bath (3)H-taurocholate accumulation ratio of 5.63+/-0.28 in male and of 3.67+/-0.43 in female rats (p<0.01). This difference in cellular taurocholate uptake was corroborated by the clearance studies, which showed a 3H-taurocholate clearance of 133.9+/-28.1 in male rats and of 262.0+/-45.4 uL/min x 100 g b.w. in female rats (p<0.05). Testosterone treatment of female rats did not significantly alter the cell to bath (3)H-taurocholate accumulation ratio. However, the cellular taurocholate accumulation significantly decreased, by 61.6+/-10.1%, following ethinylestradiol treatment of male rats. Ovariectomy, chemical castration of female rats with buserelin or treatment of female rats with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780 did not affect taurocholate uptake, but treatment of ovariectomized rats with ethinylestradiol decreased the taurocholate accumulation ratio by 53.7+/-15.8%. By determination of serum bile acids the possibility was excluded that this change was an indirect effect of cholestasis induced by ethinylestradiol. This study demonstrates gender differences in the renal handling of taurocholate in rats that may be related to an inhibitory effect of estrogens on taurocholate transport in proximal tubular cells. Since the ASBT protein content of the proximal tubular cells was found not to be different between male and female rats, a nongenomic mechanism may underlie this estrogen effect."

The objective of our study was to study sequential changes in the pancreas and distant organs in sodium taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in a rat model. Sixteen male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g ... were distributed into two groups: induced acute pancreatitis (study group: 8 rats) and a control group (8 rats). Within each group, the animals were divided into subgroups: those who were sacrificed early (24 hr and 72 hr; two each) and those who were sacrificed late (120 hr and 240 hr; two each). Acute pancreatitis was induced in the rats by multiple intraparenchymal injections of 10% sodium taurocholate solution. In the controls, the same amount of normal saline was injected into the pancreatic parenchyma. Pathological examination of the pancreas, lungs, kidneys, intestine and liver was done. In this model of taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis, the early changes observed in the pancreas were focal hemorrhages, parenchymal necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. At 72 hours, the changes observed were acinar necrosis, edema, fibrin deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration. Late changes were fibrinoid necrosis and fibroblast proliferation. In the acute phase, the histological changes in the lungs were congestion, focal pulmonary edema and intra-alveolar hemorrhages while, in the late stage, there was persistence of vascular congestion. The changes observed in the kidneys were vacuolization of tubular epithelium in the subcapsular region and areas of hemorrhage in the interstitium. Intestinal changes included degenerative changes in the villous epithelium in the acute phase with normalization of the histology in the late phase. Our findings correlate with the clinical observation of multisystem organ failure in acute pancreatitis. Early changes in these organs suggest that careful observation is mandatory in patients with acute pancreatitis in order to institute supportive treatment."
