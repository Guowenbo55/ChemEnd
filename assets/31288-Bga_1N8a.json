            "Value": "AEROBIC: Diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 100% of its theoretical BOD in four weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(1). A 20-day biodegradation study using 2.5 ppm diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate in BOD bottle mineralization dilution water and settled sewage seed at 20 \u00b0C gave a theoretical BOD of 67.6%(2). The normal BOD curve for diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate seeded with microorganisms from domestic sewage shows slow development that usually requires more than five days for the BOD value to reach 20 percent of the theoretical oxygen demand (40% at 14 days)(3). Acclimated microorganisms from the Kanawana River biodegrade diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate much faster with theoretical BOD values of 84% after 10 days and 58% after 10 days using microorganisms acclimated for 59 and 28 days, respectively(3). The difficulty in oxidizing diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate is apparently related to the butoxy group(3). Diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether acetate had theoretical BOD rates of 13.3, 18.4, 24.6, and 67.0% for BOD 5, 10, 15, and 20 days, respectively(4)."
