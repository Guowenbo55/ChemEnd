When dinonyl phthalate was incubated with pure cultures of Pseudomonas acidovorans under aerobic conditions, the initial degradation products were phthalic acid and nonyl alcohol(3). Di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl) phthalate had a half-life of 6 to 8 days in river die-away tests(4). In active microcosms containing lake water and sediment, 40 to 48% of (14)C-di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl)phthalate radioactivity was evolved as carbon dioxide over a 41 day period; after six weeks no residual (14)C-di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl) phthalate was found in the water column and only 2 to 6% was associated with sediments(4). In semi-continuous activated sludge tests, a primary degradation half-life of <1 day at an addition rate of 5 to 200 mg/L per 24-hour cycle was observed for di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl) phthalate(4). In shake flask studies using an acclimated bacterial inoculum, an ultimate biodegradation half-life of 5 days was observed for di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl) phthalate at an initial concentration of 20 mg/L(4). 98% Biodegradation of di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl) phthalate was observed over a period of 28 days in shake flask tests using an acclimated inoculum consisting of soil and sewage microorganisms(5)."

The esters included di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, butyl, benzyl-phthalate, di(n-butyl)phthalate, di(isodecyl)phthalate, di(isononyl)phthalate, di(undecyl)phthalate, di(n-hexyl,n-octyl,undecyl)phthalate, and di(heptyl,nonyl,undecyl)phthalate. ... Each of the compounds was fed to groups of five male and five female rats in the diet at concentrations of 2.5, 1.2, and either 0.6 or 0.3% for a period of 21 days. Cyanide insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation, lauric acid-11-hydroxylase, and lauric acid-12- hydroxylase were assayed in the liver microsomes. Cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured in the serum. The results indicated that none of the esters was more potent than di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. The most sensitive parameters were relative liver weight and cyanide insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation. The latter parameter was assumed to be an indicator of peroxisome proliferation and thereby predictive of liver tumorigenesis."

Straight chain phthalate monoesters (mono(ethyl)phthalate, mono(n-butyl) phthalate, mono(n-hexyl)phthalate, mono(n-octyl)-phthalate, mono(nonyl)phthalate and mono(isononyl)phthalate) had no effect on hepatocyte intercellular communication.

Phthalates, adipates, sebacates, azelates and phosphates with long carbon chain alcohols were very non-toxic to the cells, probably due to insolubility in water of the compounds, while the citrates, some phosphates and the 2 polymer plasticizers had a higher toxicity to the cells. A comparison of the HeLa cytotoxicity with the toxicity in vitro to other cells for 7 plasticizers showed a similarity of the cytotoxicity to all cell types. A comparison of the HeLa cytotoxicity for 20 plasticizers with ip lethal dosage in rodents demonstrated a rough similarity of values, suggesting a toxicity in rodents of the compounds by toxic interference of the agents with basal functions and structures of tissues (basal cytotoxicity)."

Phthalate enhancement of the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, 2-nitrofluorene, and benzo[a]pyrene was not observed with either test. The mutagenicity-enhancing ability may be related to the induction of enzymes such as P450IIB, that metabolize amino acid pyrolysates. By quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a good correlation was observed between the mutagenicity-enhancing activity of phthalates and their octanol-water partition coefficients."
