Here, /the study examined/  the effects of acetic acid treatment on yeast cells by 2-DE, revealing alterations in the levels of proteins directly or indirectly linked with the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway: amino-acid biosynthesis, transcription/translation machinery, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, stress response, protein turnover and cell cycle. The increased levels of proteins involved in amino-acid biosynthesis presented a counteracting response to a severe intracellular amino-acid starvation induced by acetic acid. Deletion of GCN4 and GCN2 encoding key players of general amino-acid control (GAAC) system caused a higher resistance to acetic acid indicating an involvement of Gcn4p/Gcn2p in the apoptotic signaling. Involvement of the TOR pathway in acetic acid-induced apoptosis was also reflected by the higher survival rates associated to a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-negative phenotype and lower reactive oxygen species levels of Deltator1 cells. In addition, deletion mutants for several downstream mediators of the TOR pathway revealed that apoptotic signaling involves the phosphatases Pph21p and Pph22p but not Sit4p. Altogether, /these/ results indicate that GAAC and TOR pathways (Tor1p) are involved in the signaling of acetic acid-induced apoptosis."

Numerous studies have examined the mechanisms of bladder irritation by acetic acid; however, the direct effect of acetic acid on ion channels in detrusor smooth muscle cells has not been evaluated. /The study/ used whole-cell patch-clamp techniques to examine the effect of acetic acid on large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) from guinea pig detrusor smooth muscle cells and CHO cells expressing recombinant human BKCaalphabeta1 (CHO BKCaalphabeta1) and human BKCaalpha (CHO BKCaalpha). Acetic acid activated BKCa currents in a concentration-dependent (0.01% to 0.05% v/v) manner in all the cell systems studied. Acetic acid (0.05%) increased BKCa current at +30 mV by 2764 +/- 918% (n=8) in guinea pig detrusor smooth muscle cells. Acetic acid (0.03%) shifted the V1/2 of conductance-voltage curve by 64 +/- 14 (n=5), 128 +/- 14 (n=5), and 126 +/- 12 mV (n=4) in CHO BKCaalpha, CHO BKCaalphabeta1 and detrusor smooth muscle cells, respectively. This effect of acetic acid was found to be independent of pH and was also not produced by its salt form, sodium acetate. Automated patch-clamp experiments also showed similar activation of CHO BKCaalphabeta1 by acetic acid. In conclusion, acetic acid directly activates BKCa channels in detrusor smooth muscle cells. This novel study necessitates caution while interpreting the results from acetic acid bladder irritation model."

            "Value": "/It was/ previously shown that acetic acid activates a mitochondria-dependent death process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Mitochondrial fragmentation and degradation have also been shown in response to this death stimulus. Herein, /the study/ show that autophagy is not active in cells undergoing acetic acid-induced apoptosis and is therefore not responsible for mitochondrial degradation. Furthermore, /the study/ found that the vacuolar protease Pep4p and the AAC proteins have a role in mitochondrial degradation using yeast genetic approaches. Depletion and overexpression of Pep4p, an orthologue of human cathepsin D, delays and enhances mitochondrial degradation respectively. Moreover, Pep4p is released from the vacuole into the cytosol in response to acetic acid treatment. AAC-deleted cells also show a decrease in mitochondrial degradation in response to acetic acid and are not defective in Pep4p release. Therefore, AAC proteins seem to affect mitochondrial degradation at a step subsequent to Pep4p release, possibly triggering degradation through their involvement in mitochondrial permeabilization. The finding that both mitochondrial AAC proteins and the vacuolar Pep4p interfere with mitochondrial degradation suggests a complex regulation and interplay between mitochondria and the vacuole in yeast programmed cell death."

Gastric ulcers were induced by luminal application of 60% acetic acid under surgical conditions. Control rats were subjected to the same surgical procedure, but with the application of saline instead of the acid. Somatic pain sensitivity (tail flick latency), plasma corticosterone level, adrenal and thymus weight were investigated under conditions of the formation and the healing of gastric ulcers. The application of the acid resulted in the formation of kissing gastric ulcers, the increase of somatic pain sensitivity (the decrease of tail flick latency) as well as the appearance of typical signs of chronic stress: long-lasting increase of plasma corticosterone level, adrenal gland hypertrophy and thymus gland involution. Natural healing of gastric ulcers was accompanied by restoration of pain sensitivity as well as attenuation of the signs of chronic stress. Delay of ulcer healing by the daily indomethacin administration (2 mg/kg, s.c.) prevented the restoration of somatic pain sensitivity.

In a 7-day oral range-finding study (gavage) rats were treated with 0, 17 (males), 23 (females), 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/d). Ethyltriacetoxysilane rapidly hydrolyzes (in seconds) to acetic acid and a trisilanol (3:1). The silanol generated is insignificant in both quantity and toxicity relative to the production of acetic acid and its associated toxicity. Animals from the 17 (males), 23 (females) and 100 mg/kg/day dose groups survived to day 7. Animals from the 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day dose groups were sacrificed after the third dose as a consequence of two deaths (one from each group), marked body weight loss, and severity of lesions (ulceration and erosion of stomach and esophagus) observed in necropsied animals. The stomach lesions observed resembled irritation from acetic acid production. This 7-day range-finder study indicated that a maximum dose level of less than 17 (males) and 23 (females) mg/kg/day would be required for a longer duration repeated dose study in order to avoid death or obvious suffering due to the corrosivity of the hydrolysis product, acetic acid. NOAELs following repeated exposure to acetic acid and its salts range from 210 mg/kg bw/day (2-4 month acetic acid drinking water study; systemic toxicity) to 3600 mg/kg bw/day (acetic acid, sodium salt, 4 week dietary study; no effects reported). Signs of irritation/corrosion at the site of contact as well as systemic toxicity have been reported. Prolonged inhalation exposure to acetic acid results in muscle imbalance, increase in blood cholinesterase activity, decreases in albumins and decreased growth at concentrations greater than 0.01 mg/cu m/day..."

The main objective of this study was to determine whether high concentrations of ethanol or acetic acid in total mixed ration would affect performance in dairy cows. Thirty mid-lactation Holstein cows were grouped in 10 blocks and fed one of the following diets for 7 wk: (1) control (33% Bermuda hay + 67% concentrates), (2) ethanol [control diet + 5% ethanol, dry matter (DM) basis], or (3) acetic acid (control diet + 5% acetic acid, DM basis). Ethanol and acetic acid were diluted in water (1:2) and sprayed onto total mixed rations twice daily before feeding. An equal amount of water was mixed with the control ration. To adapt animals to these treatments, cows were fed only half of the treatment dose during the first week of study. Cows fed ethanol yielded more milk (37.9 kg/d) than those fed the control (35.8 kg/d) or acetic acid (35.3 kg/d) diets, mainly due to the higher DM intake (DMI; 23.7, 22.2, and 21.6 kg/d, respectively). The significant diet x week interaction for DMI, mainly during wk 2 and 3 (when acetic acid reached the full dose), was related to the decrease in DMI observed for the acetic acid treatment. There was a diet x week interaction in excretion of milk energy per DMI during wk 2 and 3, due to cows fed acetic acid sustained milk yield despite lower DMI. Energy efficiency was similar across diets. Blood metabolites (glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, ethanol, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity) and sensory characteristics of milk were not affected by these treatments. Animal performance suggested similar energy value for the diet containing ethanol compared with other diets. Rumen conversion of ethanol to acetate and a concomitant increase in methane production might be a plausible explanation for the deviation of the predicted energy value based on the heat of combustion. Therefore, the loss of volatile compounds during the drying process in the laboratory should be considered when calculating energy content of fermented feedstuffs."

Haloacetic acids can be formed by a variety of processes, e.g. chloroacetic acids can be formed during chlorination and bromoacetic acids can be by-products of ozonation. Both dichloro- and trichloroacetic acids have been reported to be teratogenic. There is little information regarding the developmental toxicity of bromoacetates and no structure-activity analysis of haloacetates. Therefore, 3-6 somite CD-1 mouse embryos were exposed to acetic acid (AA), or mono (M), di (D), and tri (T) substituted chloro (C) or bromo (B)-acetic acids (A) (e.g. DCA= dichloroacetic acid) in whole embryo culture and the morphological effects were evaluated. Conceptuses exposed to these agents for 24 hours exhibited malformations. Neural tube defects ranged from prosencephalic hypoplasia to non-closure throughout the cranial region. Other craniofacial defects included optic, otic and pharyngeal arch dysmorphogenesis. Benchmark concentrations (BC) for a 5% increase in NTDs for the studied chemicals in order of increasing potency are dichloroacetic acid (2452 uM) <acetic acid (1888 uM) <tribromoacetic acid (1403 uM) <trichloroacetic acid (1336 uM) <dibromoacetic acid (162 uM) <monochloroacetic acid (91.5 uM) <monobromoacetic acid (2.68 uM). Quantitative structure-activity relationships were derived from these data and other (iodo(I) and fluoro (F)) haloacetic acid data not presented (monoiodoacetic acid, monofluoroacetic acid, difluoroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid). The best regression was derived by excluding acetic acid (n=10) and relating log (1/BC) to Elumo and pKa with r=0.96, adj.r2 =0.90. These studies indicate that all of the haloacetates can directly alter development and there is a wide range of concentration that produce dysmorphogenesis."

The increased levels of proteins involved in amino-acid biosynthesis presented a counteracting response to a severe intracellular amino-acid starvation induced by acetic acid. Deletion of GCN4 and GCN2 encoding key players of general amino-acid control (GAAC) system caused a higher resistance to acetic acid indicating an involvement of Gcn4p/Gcn2p in the apoptotic signaling. Involvement of the TOR pathway in acetic acid-induced apoptosis was also reflected by the higher survival rates associated to a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-negative phenotype and lower reactive oxygen species levels of Deltator1 cells. In addition, deletion mutants for several downstream mediators of the TOR pathway revealed that apoptotic signaling involves the phosphatases Pph21p and Pph22p but not Sit4p.

These models induce a characteristic and quantifiable overt pain-like behavior described as writhing response or abdominal contortions. The knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the chosen model is a crucial step forward demonstrating the mechanisms that the candidate drug would inhibit because the mechanisms triggered in that model will be addressed. Herein, it was investigated the role of spinal mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (Jun N-terminal Kinase) and p38, PI(3)K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and microglia in the writhing response induced by acetic acid and phenyl-p-benzoquinone, and flinch induced by formalin in mice. Acetic acid and phenyl-p-benzoquinone induced significant writhing response over 20 min. The nociceptive response in these models were significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced by intrathecal pre-treatment with ERK (PD98059), JNK (SB600125), p38 (SB202190) or PI(3)K (wortmannin) inhibitors. Furthermore, the co-treatment with MAP kinase and PI(3)K inhibitors, at doses that were ineffective as single treatment, significantly inhibited acetic acid- and phenyl-p-benzoquinone-induced nociception. The treatment with microglia inhibitors minocycline and fluorocitrate also diminished the nociceptive response. Similar results were obtained in the formalin test. Concluding, MAP kinases and PI(3)K are important spinal signaling kinases in acetic acid and phenyl-p-benzoquinone models of overt pain-like behavior and there is also activation of spinal microglia indicating that it is also important to determine whether drugs tested in these models also modulate such spinal mechanisms."

Acetic acid solution was infused into the bladder for 5 min via the urethral orifice without any surgical procedures under isoflurane anesthesia. After washing the bladder with saline, voiding frequency (VF) and total urine volume were determined for 9 hr under conscious conditions. Infusion of a 0.5% acetic acid solution caused a significant increase in VF, without influencing total urine volume or inducing significant histopathological inflammatory alterations in the bladder urothelium. Oral administration of oxybutynin (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated increases in VF induced by 0.5% acetic acid. Infusion of 0.75% acetic acid induced intensive urinary inflammation and a decrease in total urine volume as well as an increase in VF. Oral treatment with oxybutynin (10 mg/kg) did not significantly improve the increased VF due to 0.75% acetic acid. Acetic acid (0.5%) infusion evoked bladder hyper-responsiveness whether applied at night or during the day. However, VF was increased more by the nighttime application of acetic acid, while there were no significant differences in basal levels of VF between daytime and nighttime. In this study, the non-invasive rat urinary hyperactive bladder model indicated minimizes the secondary effects of experimental procedures such as surgical operations and anesthesia on bladder function and is sensitive to oxybutynin.
