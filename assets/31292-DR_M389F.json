Using the Warburg respirometer screening test and activated sludge from 3 sewage treatment plants stearic acid amide reached approximately 3% of theoretical BOD after 24 hours(2). Additional biodegradation studies with analogous substances indicate that stearic acid amide is likely to be biodegradable under certain environmental conditions and have low environmental persistence(3)."
