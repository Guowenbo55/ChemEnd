The acetone concentration during each exposure rose during the first 1.5 hours to a constant level of about 8,000 ppm for the remaining 3.5 hours. Olfactory sensitivity, assessed by how the mice avoided acetone in a maze, was increased (less time spent in the acetone compartment of maze) during weeks 2 and 4 of exposure and during weeks 6 and 8 (postexposure). Histological examination of olfactory neuroepithelium of similarly exposed mice revealed a significant decrease in the number of cells at week 2, an increase at week 4 that remained at week 6, and a recovery by week 8. Thickness of the olfactory epithelium remained stable at week 0 and week 2, decreased at week 4, increased at week 6, and recovered by week 8. Immunological evaluations for olfactory marker protein (OMP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) showed no change in OMP, indicating no damage to olfactory neuroreceptors. However, the number of PCNA-positive cells was decreased in the basal layer during week 2 and sustained during weeks 4 and 6, indicating an increase in mitotic activity."

Acetone induced more extensive fatty changes, and mild necrosis in the livers of the obese mice compared with the livers of both control lean and control obese mice. The acetone-treated obese mice also had higher caspase-3 activity, numerous apoptotic hepatocytes, increased protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal- and 3-nitrotyrosine-protein adducts, and elevated levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase.

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Due to their specific position in the nasal cavity, the cells of olfactory neuroepithelium can be damaged by exposure to environmental airborne chemicals. However, few studies have been focused on selective damage, i.e. olfactory sensory neurons, basal cells, supporting and duct cells. As solvents are known to induce critical effects on olfactory neuroepithelium (OE), this study was designed to characterize histological and immunohistological effects induced by acetone exposure on OE in mice. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate olfactory sensitivity. Moreover, olfactory neuroepithelium was examined to evaluate the thickness and the total number of cells. Finally, different markers, olfactory marker protein (OMP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were used to characterize respectively olfactory sensory neurons and basal cells, and secondly to evaluate the dynamic of the tissue turnover. Results showed structural modifications, since the thickness and the number of cells in the OE were modified according to the time course of the exposure. Additionally, no changes for OMP-positive cells were observed whereas significant differences appeared for the density of PCNA-positive cells in relation to their location (main-body or basal layer of OE). These findings indicate that acetone exposure induces selective damage in olfactory neuroepithelium."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ ... Evidence of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) mediated free radical production and protein oxidation in acetone-induced ketosis /was provided/ by using iNOS and NADPH oxidase knockout mice receiving acetone in a single intragastric dose or in drinking water for 5 days or 3 weeks. In the acute intragastric experiment, free radical production was unchanged in NADPH oxidase knockout mice. However, free radical production was greatly decreased in iNOS knockout mice, indicating that iNOS may play a role in acetone-induced free radical production. Longer-term exposure to acetone via drinking water resulted in iNOS over-expression and protein radical formation in the liver. Other results included enhanced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation after 21 days of acetone treatment in control and NADPH oxidase knockout mice, but not in iNOS knockout mice. These results together indicate that acetone administration can result in iNOS over-expression that leads to protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation via a free radical-dependent mechanism. The authors discuss the implication of high levels of ketosis with the development of complications in diabetes."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Acetone has the ability to induce the enzymatic activity of a specific constitutive cytochrome P450 isozyme that plays an important role in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates. A considerable amount of information is available on the physiological function and toxicologic consequence of P450 induction by acetone. Because acetone is metabolized by the same P450 isozyme that is induced following high-dose administration the auto-inductive increase in cytochrome P450 levels provides a mechanism for increasing the elimination of acetone when high body burdens develop. The pretreatment of laboratory animals with acetone can also potentiate or antagonize the acute effects of known systemic toxicants that are metabolized by the induced P450 isozyme. The potentiation observed following acetone administration has involved treatments with known nephrotoxins and hepatotoxins; the potentiating effects were generally quantitative in nature and involved an increase in the extent of damage without altering the types of tissues or organs affected. Minimally effective dose thresholds have been shown to exist for the induction of cytochrome P450 by acetone."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ In the present study, CYP2E1-null mice were used to demonstrate the role of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in acetone catabolism in vivo. The blood acetone level in male CYP2E1-null mice was 3.3 +/- 0.9 ug/mL, which was similar to levels of their sex- and age-matched parental lineage strains C57BL/6N (2.3 +/- 0.2 ug/mL) and 129/Sv (3.5 +/- 0.3 ug/mL) mice (both are CYP2E1 wild-type). After fasting for 48 hr, the blood acetone levels in the CYP2E1 wild-type mice were increased by 2.5- to 4.4-fold, but that in the CYP2E1-null mice increased 28-fold. These results clearly demonstrate that CYP2E1 plays a vital role in the catabolism of acetone under fasting conditions."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Treatment of rats with acetone (2.5-5 mL/kg, intragastric) caused a 3-4.5-fold enhancement in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMAd) activity. This was accompanied by only moderate incr in gross cytochrome P450 content & reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductase & 261% incr in ethoxycoumarin O-dealkylase activity. The treatment enhanced the metabolism of nitrosomethylethylamine, nitrosomethylbenzylamine, & nitrosomethylaniline, although to lesser extents than with nitrosodimethylamine. Observations suggest that the enhanced nitrosodimethylamine demethylase was due to induction of 1 or more specific P450 isozyme(s) by pretreatment with acetone or isopropanol. Treatment induced proteins with molecular weights of 50,000 & 52,000 which were in the range of known P450 isozymes. The induction of these proteins & nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity was inhibited by cobaltous chloride & cycloheximide. The induced microsomes had a peak at 450.6 nm, different from 450.0 nm peak of control microsomes. When added to the incubation mixture, acetone & isopropanol inhibited nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity. Isopropanol was more potent than acetone."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The efficacy of acetone vapors against carefully aged eggs of Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) at 17+/-1 and 27+/-1 degrees C at different dosage levels of acetone over various exposure times was determined. Acetone was found to be toxic to Indian meal moth eggs. Considerable variation in the susceptibility of different age groups of eggs was apparent in the fiducial limits of the LD50 values. An inverse relationship between LD50 values and exposure times was observed in age groups of tested eggs. At 27+/-1 degrees C and 24 hr exposure period, eggs aged 1-2 day-old were more tolerant to acetone than other age groups, followed by 0-1 day-old, 2-3 day-old and 3-4 day-old eggs. A similar pattern of susceptibility of eggs was observed at 72 hr exposure. In all bioassays, eggs exposed to higher dosages of acetone developed at smaller rate. This was significant for the eggs, which were exposed to the highest dosage for 24 hr. Increasing the temperature from 17+/-1 to 27+/-1 degrees C greatly increased the efficacy of acetone. At 27+/-1 degrees C eggs of P. interpunctella were killed by less than one-third of the dosage required for control at 17+/-1 degrees C. Acetone achieved 50% mortality with a dosage of 82.76 mg/L in 1-2 day-old eggs at 27+/-1 degrees C. At this temperature hatching was retarded and greatly diminished when eggs aged 1-2 day-old were exposed to 80 mg/L of acetone for the 24 h exposure period. There was no evidence of a hatch delay longer than the time spent under vapors for eggs exposed at 17+/-1 or 27+/-1 degrees C, indicating that some development must have occurred under fumigation."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Acetone, one of the principal ketone bodies elevated during treatment with the ketogenic diet, exhibits anticonvulsant properties that may contribute to the seizure protection conferred by the diet. The anticonvulsant mechanism of acetone is unknown, but it is metabolized to several bioactive substances that could play a role. Acetone and its major metabolites-acetol, 1,2-propanediol, methylglyoxal, and pyruvic acid-were assessed for anticonvulsant activity in two mouse seizure models. Various doses of the substances administered intraperitoneally were characterized for their ability to elevate the threshold for clonic seizures induced by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and for protection against tonic seizures induced by subcutaneous bolus administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The inverted-screen test was used to assess acute neurological toxicity. Acetone (1-32 mmol/kg, i.p.), in a dose-dependent fashion, elevated the PTZ threshold and conferred protection against 4-AP seizures (ED(50), 26.3 mmol/kg). Effective doses of acetone (10-32 mmol/kg) did not cause motor impairment in the inverted-screen test (TD(50), 45.7 mmol/kg). In doses 10-fold greater than the minimally effective dose ofacetone (3.2 mmol/kg), the metabolites acetol, 1,2-propanediol, and pyruvic acid were inactive in the PTZ model. At higher doses that produced motor impairment, acetol and 1,2-propanediol (but not pyruvic acid) did elevate the PTZ threshold. Methylglyoxal had both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant actions, and had substantial toxicity, producing respiratory distress, motor impairment, and death. None of the acetone metabolites protected against 4-AP seizures. This study confirms the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant properties of acetone and indicates that the seizure protection conferred is unlikely to result from its major metabolic products."
