The results showed that all three pesticides could be taken up by rice roots, with varying distribution patterns in plant tissues. Epoxiconazole exhibited the highest accumulation in rice roots, followed by tebuconazole and then triadimefon, while the reverse order was observed in rice shoots. The movement of these pesticides within rice tissues involved both symplast and apoplast pathways, with different preferences for each pesticide. Subcellular distribution analysis revealed that all three pesticides had a higher proportion in cell walls compared to cell organelles and soluble components. Epoxiconazole had the highest accumulation in cell walls, while triadimefon was more concentrated in soluble components. The study concluded that the uptake, movement, and subcellular distribution of these pesticides are influenced by their hydrophobicity, highlighting the complex interactions between pesticides and plant tissues.",
