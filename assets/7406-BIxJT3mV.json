            "Value": "AEROBIC: Using river water and sediment in a test system, the aerobic biodegradation of isopropylbenzene was studied in a closed system. The disappearance rate constant of isopropylbenzene (average concentration 2.5 mg/L) for total mineralization was 0.02/day; this equates to a half-life of 34.6 days. However, when volatilization was considered coupled with biodegradation, the half-life for isopropylbenzene became 2.5 days. Isopropylbenzene biodegradation experienced a lag time of approximately 5 days. Based on the results of this experiment, residence time of isopropylbenzene in aquatic ecosystems will likely be brief(1). Isopropylbenzene was added to uncontaminated groundwater and this solution was continuously percolated through a column containing homogeneous sand(2). No additional nutrients were added to the system and it was assumed to be aerobic throughout. Biodegradation occurred following 5 days of acclimation and the isopropylbenzene degraded to non-detectable levels within 48 hr(2). Mixed cultures from contaminated and uncontaminated estuarine sediments were capable of degrading isopropylbenzene with the higher rate observed in the culture from the contaminated sediment(3). Isopropylbenzene incubated with mixed cultures taken from various depths in the Atlantic Ocean at 15 \u00b0C were all capable of biodegrading isopropylbenzene(4)."

The concentrations within the first 2 min. depressing the respiratory rate by 50% due to the effect in the upper respiratory tract were 2,058 ppm and 22,080 ppm, respectively. Activation of the sensory irritant receptor followed the dynamics of reversible bimolecular reactions. The extrapolated maximum response and the apparent dissociation constant were 114.3% and 2,723 ppm for cumene and 68.4% and 8,178 ppm for propanol, respectively. Later on desensitization was observed. The effect was weak for cumene but conspicuous for propanol. For cumene desensitization had the origin in the rise of a threshold. No change in the dissociation constant or the maximum response was found. For propanol a decrease in the maximum response, which may be explained by an allosteric effect, was observed. The pulmonary irritation response was weak for cumene but was for propanol more important than sensory irritation at high concentrations. The following hypotheses are put forward: the effect of pulmonary irritation on the tidal volume is mediated via the stretch receptors while the effect on the respiratory frequency is mediated via the J-receptors."

Fischer-344 rats were exposed to cumene vapor at concentrations of 0, 100, 500 and 1,200 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 13 weeks. A separate group received one 6 hour exposure. A second study tested similar exposure regimens for cumene concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 500 and 1,200 ppm. Blood samples from the rats in each group were collected for the measurement of hematological and serum chemistry parameters. The rats were killed during week 14 of the first study, or following a 4 week post-exposure in the second study, and nervous system tissues were analyzed via light microscopy. Remaining rats in the subchronic study underwent complete necropsy after death. Male rats exposed to 500 and 1,200 ppm in the first study exhibited decreases in motor activity, but such effects were not observed in the second study. Male rats in the 500 and 1,200 ppm exposure groups demonstrated renal proximal tubular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and hyaline drop formation as well. No exposure related ophthalmologic results or effects on spermatogenesis were found. Rats of both sexes from these groups also demonstrated decreased body weight and food consumption and altered hematological and clinical chemistry parameters. It was concluded that cumene produces mild to moderate toxic effects in rats at concentrations between 500 to 1,200 ppm, and that cumene vapor produces no appreciable neurotoxic or ototoxic effects at these concentrations."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ New Zealand White rabbits (15/group) were exposed to 0, 492, 1,206, or 2,297 ppm (0, 2,418, 5,928, or 11,292 mg/cu m) cumene for 6 hr/day on Days 6 through 18 of gestation. Dams were observed for clinical signs of toxicity, body weight, gravid uterine weight, liver weight, abnormalities of the respiratory tract, numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, resorptions, and living and dead fetuses. Fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations and variations. Two does died at the highest exposure concentration. There were significant (p < 0.01) reductions in body weight gain (178.11 g lost compared to 31.55 g gained in the control group) and food consumption at the highest exposure level. Significantly (p < 0.05) reduced food consumption also was observed in the 492-and 1,206-ppm exposure groups. Clinical signs of toxicity observed in the does included significant (p < 0.01) increases in perioral and perinasal wetness and blepharospasm at the high concentration. At necropsy, there were color changes in the lungs of 33% of the does exposed to 2,297 ppm. Relative liver weight was significantly (p < 0.01) elevated (16.8% of control weight) at the highest exposure level. There were no statistically significant effects on gestation parameters; however, there were nonsignificant increases in nonviable implants, and early resorptions and a nonsignificant decrease in the percent of live fetuses at 2,297 ppm. The only variation observed was an increase in ecchymosis (hemorrhagic areas of the skin) of the head that occurred in all exposed animals (0, 5.4, 3.7, and 4.9% of the fetuses and 0, 35.7, 28.6, and 25.0% of the litters at 0, 492, 1,206, and 2,297 ppm, respectively), which was not concentration-related. ...  No other malformations or variations differed from control values. Although the alterations observed in gestational parameters were not significant, they were consistent in indicating possible developmental effects. Based on this consistency, the highest exposure level is considered a LOAEL. The next lower level, 1,206 ppm, is considered a NOAEL for both developmental and maternal effects."

Effects noted from brief (20-min) exposures to cumene included those on CNS activity (decreased arousal and rearing at 2,000 ppm) muscle tone/equilibrium (changes in grip strength and mobility 4,000 ppm), and sensorimotor activity (including decreased tail pinch and touch response 4,000 ppm)."

In order to do this, an explicit protocol for the FOB developed for rats by Moser was adapted for use in mice with inhalation exposures. All six alkylbenzenes, in the concentration range of 2000 to 8000 ppm, produced a nearly identical profile of effects, a profile that was also produced by ip administration of the central nervous system depressant drug pentobarbital. These effects included changes in posture, decreased arousal and rearing, increased ease of handling, disturbances of gait, mobility, and righting reflex, decreased forelimb grip strength, increased landing foot splay, and impaired psychomotor coordination. The response to various sensory stimuli was also decreased by the alkylbenzenes and pentobarbital. These acute effects of alkylbenzenes were short-lived, with recovery beginning within minutes of removal from the exposure chamber. The finding that the alkylbenzenes produce a profile of neurobehavioral effects similar to that of pentobarbital is consistent with a growing body of other evidence that many solvents produce a profile of acute effects similar to that of central nervous system depressant drugs and ethanol."

Principal component analysis segregated the carcinomas into groups with and without K-ras mutations, but failed to separate the tumors based on p53 mutation status. Expression of genes associated with the Erk MAP kinase signaling pathway was significantly altered in carcinomas with K-ras mutations compared to tumors without K-ras mutations or normal lung. Gene expression analysis also suggested that cumene-induced carcinomas with K-ras mutations have greater malignant potential than those without mutations. In addition, significance analysis of function and expression (SAFE) demonstrated expression changes of genes regulated by histone modification in carcinomas with K-ras mutations. The gene expression analysis suggested the formation of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in cumene-exposed mice typically involves mutation of K-ras, which results in increased Erk MAP kinase signaling and modification of histones."

K-ras and p53 mutations were detected by cycle sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded neoplasms. K-ras mutations were detected in 87% of cumene-induced lung neoplasms, and the predominant mutations were exon 1 codon 12 G to T transversions and exon 2 codon 61 A to G transitions. P53 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 56% of cumene-induced neoplasms, and mutations were detected in 52% of neoplasms. The predominant mutations were exon 5, codon 155 G to A transitions, and codon 133 C to T transitions. No p53 mutations and one of seven (14%) K-ras mutations were detected in spontaneous neoplasms. Cumene-induced lung carcinomas showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 4 near the p16 gene (13%) and on chromosome 6 near the K-ras gene (12%). No LOH was observed in spontaneous carcinomas or normal lung tissues examined. The pattern of mutations identified in the lung tumors suggests that DNA damage and genomic instability may be contributing factors to the mutation profile and development of lung cancer in mice exposed to cumene."
