            "Value": "AEROBIC: 2-Xylene has been observed to biodegrade in standard biodegradability tests using various inocula including sewage, activated sludge and sea water(1-4). It was completely degraded in 8 days in groundwater in a gasoline-oil mixture; the acclimation period was 3-4 days(5). In laboratory experiments designed to simulate saturated-flow conditions typical of a river water/ground water infiltration system, degradation was rapid with 70% removal in the first 1.5 cm of the column after 10 days of operation under aerobic conditions(6). Another investigator found that 2-xylene was readily biodegraded (33 mg/day loss) in shallow ground water in an unconfined sand aquifer when oxygen was present(7). As the available oxygen was consumed, the rate of degradation decreased(7). 2-Xylene degraded in two steps with adaptation periods of 14 and 49 days, using an unpolluted groundwater seed(8,9). Xylene (mixed isomers), present at 100 mg/L, reached 100% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified xylene as readily biodegradable(10). Using OECD Guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) with a mixture of sewage, soil and natural water inoculum, 2-xylene reached 90-94% of its O2 consumption in 28 days which classified xylene as readily biodegradable in two separate studies(11). An OECD Guideline 301F test using activated sludge found >60% degradation in 28 days, but degradation failed the 10-day window for being readily biodegradable(11)."

A lag period of >20 weeks was needed before there was any appreciable biodegradation, 78% and >99% degradation were reported at week 40 and 120, respectively(2). 2-Xylene was completely mineralized after a long adaptation period (200-255 days), under anaerobic conditions by aquifer-derived microorganisms obtained from creosote-contaminated sediment(3). Degradation was shown to be inhibited by the addition of preferred substrates (acetate, propionate, etc)(3).

The young animals demonstrated white, raised, nodular lesions along the free margins of the liver. The lesions in young animals consisted of lipid droplets surrounded by macrophages and fibroblasts. Some fibroblasts in these lesions appeared to be active in collagen synthesis. Mast cells and eosinophils also occurred in the lesions. Hepatocytes in these young animals appeared morphologically normal. In contrast, hepatocytes in the aging rats developed 2 types of vacuoles. The 1st type of vacuole was bound by a double-unit membrane--the other unit membrane possibly derived from smooth endoplasmic reticulum; it contained a mottled, globular, electron-lucent material. The 2nd type of vacuole was peripherally located in hepatocytes, was single membrane-bound, and occasionally was observed opening into the space of Disse (spatium perisinusoideum). Our observations indicated that acute exposures (3 days) to at least some methylated benzenes does not cause ultrastructurally observable abnormalities in hepatocytes of young rats, but chronic oral ingestion of some can cause formation of vacuolar structures in aging rat hepatocytes. /Methylated benzenes/"

The purity of the o-xylene was not provided. Biochemical indices of liver metabolic capacity (drug-metabolizing enzyme activities) and liver damage (serum activities of AST and ALT; ... ) were measured, as were body weights and organ weights. Liver tissue samples were examined by light and electron microscopy. Statistical differences between exposed and control group means were compared by variance analysis and Dunnett's test. Exposure to 1090 ppm o-xylene for 6 or 12 months resulted in increased food and water consumption, decreased body weight gain, increased absolute and relative liver weight, and induction of enzymes of the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system (increased cytochromes P- 450 and b-5, cytochrome c reductase, alanine hydroxylase, and aminopyrene N-demethylase). Data were presented in graphical form only. At 1 year, the control mean body weight was about 700 g, compared with an exposed mean of about 600 g. This change represents about a 15% decrease and was reported to have been statistically significant (p<0.05). Histologic and histochemical examination of the organs, including the liver, were reported to have shown no pathological alterations or changes in serum activities of AST or ALT. Electron microscopy of liver tissue samples revealed moderate proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The hepatic effects are not considered adverse. The exposure level of 1090 ppm o-xylene is a LOAEL for decreased body weight in male rats with no adverse changes in hepatic endpoints."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ The preponderance of data from testing in vivo ... and in vitro ... indicates that xylenes are not mutagenic and do not induce chromosomal anomalies. A few studies indicate that DNA fragmentation may occur if cells are exposed to levels that cause cytotoxicity, presumably related to the activity of nucleases within dying cells. ... Mixed xylene, and the individual xylene isomers, have been tested for genotoxicity in a variety of short term in vitro assays. Results of standard mutagenicity assays indicate that mixed xylene and xylene isomers are not mutagenic in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells ... . Mixed xylenes did not induce umu gene expression, part of the SOS response to DNA damage, in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 ... . Mixed xylene did not induce chromosomal anomalies (chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges) in cultured mammalian cells ... . Mixed xylenes did not enhance the adenovirus transformation of hamster embryo cells ... . In summary, genotoxicity studies on mixed xylene and the individual isomers of xylene have provided consistently negative results in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays and test systems (bacteria, yeast, insects, cultured mammalian cells, mice, rats, and humans). Thus, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that mixed xylene, m-xylene, o-xylene, and p-xylene are nonmutagenic."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The effects of intraperitoneal administration of o-xylene (1g/kg body weight) on: (a) rat hepatic and pulmonary mixed-function oxidase content and activity; and (b) microsomal membrane structural parameters were studied 1, 3, 6 and 12 hr after administration. The pulmonary cytochrome P-450 content and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity were decreased, a maximal inhibition occurring 3 hr after dosing. Reduced pulmonary activity for both ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation was noted. In contrast, increased hepatic cytochrome P-450 content was noted, with slightly increased ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and markedly increased benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation. An increase in pulmonary microsomal phospholipid content and cholesterol content was noted even 1 hr after dosing. In liver the phospholipid content increased although there was no change in cholesterol content; this suggested an increase in membrane fluidity."

            "Value": "Koc values measured for 2-xylene in various soils (% organic matter) were 24 in Wendover silty clay (16.2%), 26 in Vaudreil sand loam (10.0%), 68 in St. Thomas sand (3.1%), and 138 in Grimsby silt loam (1.0%)(1). Batch adsorption tests, using three solid sandy aquifer materials gave a Koc of 129(2). The Koc for 2-xylene in surface sediments collected from the central Tamar estuary in the UK was 25.4(3). The Koc values for 2-xylene in two river sediments (% organic matter 6.5-16.9 wt%) was 209 and 251, respectively(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these measured Koc values suggests that 2-xylene is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil. Using OECD Guideline 121 (estimating Koc via HPLC), the Koc of 2-xylene was estimated to be 537(6). Concentration enhancement has been observed for 2-xylene in a dune-infiltration project on the Rhine River(7); however, no 2-xylene reached groundwater under a rapid infiltration site(8). The log Koc for 2-xylene in coal sediment (% organic matter 52 wt%) was 2.40(4)."
