            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a closed bottle test using a secondary activated sludge inoculum, methenamine was found to be readily biodegradable with 70% biodegraded after 28 days(1). Methenamine was categorized as a synthetic organic chemical unlikely to be removed during biological sewage treatment, even after prolonged exposure of the biota(2). In a 5-day BOD test using a sewage seed, methenamine reached 2.02% of its theoretical BOD(3). Using an activated sludge inoculum, up to 87% removal of methenamine was observed after a 28 day incubation period(4). Methenamine was not degraded in the SCAS test, but it was degraded during 28-day die-away tests(5); no rates were given(SRC). Methenamine, present at 30 mg/L, reached 22% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 100 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(6); degradation based on TOC and other parameters was 48% suggesting an abiotic hydrolysis component of the degradation(SRC). Methenamine was degraded in various screening tests (>70% DOC, >60% ThoD), but not in activated sludge simulation tests (<25% DOC removal)(7); it was suggested that methenamine would undergo hydrolysis or auto-oxidation in the 28-day screening tests to form biodegradable products, which are not produced in sufficient quantity in 3-hour simulation tests(7). It was observed that methenamine could inhibit degradation, by lowering microbial populations, in both sewage and activated sludge tests depending on concentration(8). Various biological screening studies have observed between 28-100% degradation of methenamine(9); part (or most) of the degradation can be explained by hydrolysis to form formaldehyde and ammonia followed by biodegradation(9); the degradation rate increases with acidity(9)."

The pKa of methenamine is 4.89(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4)."
