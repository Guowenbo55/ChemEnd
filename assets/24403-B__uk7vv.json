    "Description": "Sodium diphosphate is an inorganic sodium salt comprised of a diphosphate(4-) anion and four sodium(1+) cations. More commonly known as tetrasodium pyrophosphate, it finds much use in the food industry as an emulsifier and in dental hygiene as a calcium-chelating salt. It has a role as a food emulsifier, a chelator and a food thickening agent. It contains a diphosphate(4-).",
