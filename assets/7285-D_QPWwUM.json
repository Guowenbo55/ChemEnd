It was one of 12 chlorinated aliphatic compounds (1-3 carbons) in the test mixture. Almost complete removal was obtained in a 7-day aerobic bottle test with methanogenic cultures, but not with phenol-adapted cultures(2)."

            "Value": "A further publication, in abstract form only without detailed documentation of test conditions and results, presented a new hypothesis for the formation of forestomach tumors. According to these investigations, analysis of ras mutations in forestomach tumors of mice from the NTP (1993) study showed that the observed mutations are not consistent with the miscoding properties of the major DNA adduct S-[l-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(N(7)-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione that had formerly been identified in various tissues by the same working group. Preliminary studies suggested that 1,2,3-trichloropropane administration produced increases in the etheno DNA adducts 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytidine, which are thought to arise endogenously from lipid oxidation. The resulting alternative hypothesis for the formation of forestomach tumors is an indirect mutagenic effect of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by GSH depletion as a consequence of the bolus application by gavage, which may induce lipid oxidation. Consequently, GSH plays a crucial role in adduct formation, being involved both in the formation of the major DNA adduct S-[l-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(N(7)-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione and in the initiation of lipid oxidation."
