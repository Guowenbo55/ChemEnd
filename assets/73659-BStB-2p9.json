    "Description": "Maslinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 and a carboxy group at position 28 (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). It is isolated from Olea europaea and Salvia canariensis and exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.",

            "Value": "Maslinic acid is widely distributed in plants, being particularly abundant in the surface wax on the fruits and leaves of Olea europaea(1). Maslinic acid occurs in red dates, olives, camellia, megranate and sage(2). The concentration of maslinic acid in olive oil increases as the quality of the olive oil decreases(3); maslinic acid concentrations in olive oil were found to be 38 mg/kg for extra virgin, 227 mg/kg for a 9.3%-acidity virgin oil and 721 mg/kg for crude pomace olive oil(3)."

A simple GC-MS method for the simultaneous determination of betulinic, corosolic, maslinic, oleanolic and ursolic acids was developed and applied to 38 different commercial plant extracts sold as ingredients for dietary supplements. ... Lagerstroemia speciosa was rich in maslinic acid (4958 mg/kg) ... Lower quantities of triterpenic acids were identified in dried extracts of Harpagophyton procumbens root, propolis, Punica granatum root, Styrax benzoin, Vaccinium myrtillus fruits and Vitis vinifera seeds. Decoctions and fluid extracts lacked or contained very low amounts of triterpenic acids. ..."
