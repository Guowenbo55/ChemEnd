Male Wistar rats aged 6-7 weeks postnatal were exposed to vehicle (triethyl citrate, n = 12), plant-derived odors (n = 12), or 1% propionic acid odor (n = 12) under control or stress conditions, and blood samples were collected. Restraint stress increased plasma glucose and plasma corticosterone concentrations by approximately 10% (P < 0.01) and 125% (P < 0.001), respectively, in vehicle-exposed animals. Similar increases were observed in animals exposed to a 1% propionic acid odor, indicating the novelty of odor exposure does not alter stress responsiveness. There was also an increase of approximately 15% in both erythrocytic oxidative status (P < 0.001) and plasma lipid peroxidation (P < 0.05), and a decrease of approximately the same magnitude in reduced glutathione (P < 0.05) in restrained animals with vehicle exposure. There were no differences observed between control and stress treatment with plant-derived odor exposure in any of the measured parameters. It was concluded that exposure to plant-derived odors reduce corticosterone, glucose, and redox responses elicited by psychological stress."
