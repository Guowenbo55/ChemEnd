A foliar applied fungicide for cereals which is particularly active against Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Oomycetes It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an oxime O-ether, an organofluorine compound, a methyl ester and a methoxyiminoacetate strobilurin antifungal agent.",

In hydroponic conditions, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin mainly accumulated in cucumber roots, while azoxystrobin accumulated in leaves. Subcellularly, azoxystrobin accumulated as a soluble component, while pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin accumulated more in organelles and cell walls. Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin primarily entered roots via the apoplast pathway, whereas trifloxystrobin entered through the symplastic pathway. Azoxystrobin could be transported in cucumbers through anion and cation channels, while pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin were transported only through anion channels. This study is significant for evaluating environmental risks and food safety related to these fungicides.",
