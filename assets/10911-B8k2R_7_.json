            "Value": "At the Norwegian Institute for Air Research in Kjeller Norge, a study sampling 10 fish species reported that cyclic siloxanes were not detected in fish muscle tissue by gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS)(1). A study focused on determining environmental presence of cyclic dimethyl siloxanes in the Scandinavia region detected dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane in marine fish at a concentration range of <5-74 ug/g wet weight. No dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane was detected in freshwater fish, however other cyclic dimethyl siloxanes were found(2). In Norway, the following concentrations of dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane were measured (ng/g wet weight) for common mussels (1.3-1.8), flounder livers(1.4), flounder fillets (0.9), cod stomach contents (1.8-3.3), and cod livers (109.1-151.5)(3). Flounder (Pleuronectes flesus) collected from six sites in the lower Humber estuary in England in 2009 contained dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 2.5-27 ng/g wet weight(4). Herring (Clupea harengus) collected off the Swedish coast in 2007 contained  dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 1-130 ng/g lipid weight(5). A 2012 study that collected fish from the Toyko Bay Japan (Japanese sea bass, red barracuda, chub mackerel, dotted gizzard shad, Japanese anchovy, sardine, white croaker) detected mean dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 3.9-20 ng/g wet weight(6). Fish collected from the Oslofjord Norway during a 2010 study (Atlantic herring, coalfish, commond sole, Norway pout, European hake, starry skate, haddock, pollock, cod) contained mean dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 2.3-26.8 ng/g wet weight and 96-803 ng/g lipid(6)."

            "Value": "SEDIMENT: Dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane was detected in surface sediments sampled from Lake Ontario (Toronto Harbor in July 2006 at a concentration of 0.2 ug/g dry weight, Kingston Basin, <0.01 ug/g dry weight) and in sediment cores (Rochester, Missisanuga and Niagra basins <0.01 ug/g dry weight). In October 2007 surface sediments found <19.0 ng of dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane from Lake Opeongo, Algonquin Provincial Park Ontario, Canada(1). A study focused on determining environmental presence of cyclic dimethyl siloxanes in the Scandinavia region detected dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane as well as other cyclic dimethyl siloxanes in sediments throughout the region. The concentration of dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane ranged from <1-170 ng/g dry weight. The maximum cyclic dimethyl siloxane concentration detected was 2,000 ng/g at Roskilde, Denmark while all other concentrations were 15 times lower with the next highest being from Essingen in Stockholm, Sweden at 130 ng/g dry weight(2). Sediment samples collected from six sites in the lower Humber estuary in England in 2009 contained dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 30-109 ng/g dry weight(3). Twenty-five sediment samples collected from various sites of the Songhua River, China in 2009 contained dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 1.52-527 mg/g with a mean concentration of 76.1 mg/g(4). Sediments collected from the Oslofjord Norway during a 2010 study contained mean dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane concentrations of 25.7-29.3 ng/g wet weight(3)."
