Male Hartley-guinea-pigs were intradermally injected with 0.05 mL of 0.3 molar anhydride at two sites. Specific immunoglobulin-G (IgG) levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 21 days postinjection and IgE levels determined by the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test (PCA). With the exception of THPA3456 and SA, all anhydrides increased specific total IgG antibodies in all animals of their test groups. Only 3 of 9 and 7 of 9 guinea-pigs produced IgG antibodies, at low levels, to THPA3456 and SA, respectively. The highest IgG titer, 6,400, was produced by MTHPA44. Specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibody titers were increased in all animals testing IgG positive. All animals immunized with MA, MPA, MHHPA, or either isomer of MTHPA developed specific IgE antibodies with five and six out of nine developing IgE antibodies to MMA and TMA, respectively. The authors conclude that methyl substitution increased anhydride antibody formation. ..."
