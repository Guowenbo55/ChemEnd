            "Value": "Decomposition of benzenesulfonic acid took 16 days by a soil microflora inoculum in mineral salts medium(1). Sodium benzenesulfonate had a 5-day theoretical BOD (at 20 \u00b0C) of 2.6, 74.5, and 38.8% in sewage seed, acclimated activated sludge seed, and by the Warburg technique with acclimated activated sludge, respectively(2). A biodegradation study using 100 mg/l benzenesulfonic acid, consumed 62, 58, and 344 ul oxygen in an endogenous control, benzenesulfonic acid adapted cells, and benzenesulonic acid and phenol adapted cells, respectviely, in 230 minutes(3). In a 2 week closed bottle study, with 100 mg/l benzenesulfonic acid and 30 mg/l sludge, benzenesulfonic acid gave a theoretical BOD of 87%(4). Benzenesulfonic acid utilized 10.7 mg of TOC/g of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids per hour in acclimated activated sludge, indicating that the activated sludge possessed the necessary catabolic enzymes required for degradation(5)."

            "Value": "The sulfonated benzene structure appears to offer no real resistance to bacterial breakdown since BOD tests carried out on this structure in dilute solutions in river water result in considerable oxygen depletion(1). Benzenesulfonic acid is resistant to chemical oxidation by KMnO4 and to biochemical oxidation under conditions of 5 day BOD determination(2). Under conditions of dichromate COD determination, oxidation of benzenesulfonic acid amounts to 94%(2). Benzenesulfonic acid is deemed degradable by the Japanese MITI test(3). Benzenesulfonic acid allowed visible growth of 12 of 14 species of phenol- utilizing bacteria after 5 days at 30 \u00b0C(4). Benzenesulfonic acid degraded only about 4% after 13 months in aquifer slurries from both sulfate reducing and methanogenic sites(5). A study on oxidation of selected carcinogenic compounds (including sodium benzenesulfonate) by activated sludge found no significant oxidation for any compounds studied(6). The presence of a sulfonate grouping on benzene greatly reduces the susceptibility of benzenesulfonic acid to biological oxidation(7). Benzenesulfonic acid was degraded with difficulty, if at all, in aniline-acclimated activated sludge(8)."

            "Value": "Of 21 laboratories reporting on the degradation of sodium benzenesulfonate, 14 observed greater than 60% theoretical oxygen demand after an average lag time of 12 days and biodegradation time of 28 days(1). Benzenesulfonic acid was degraded (based on COD) 98.5% at a rate of 10.6 mg COD/gram-hour by microbes in adapted activated sludge inoculum(2). Benzenesulfonic acid should be degradable by biological sewage treatment provided suitable acclimation can be achieved(3). Benzenesulfonic acid biodegraded with a lag time of 100-110 hours, a rate of 0.013-0.034 per hour, and a half-life of 170-180 hours using a electrolytic respirometer in water indicating that it is biodegraded partially in a long time by acclimatized microorganisms(4,5). Benzenesulfonic acid degraded greater than 90% after 9 days with 2 days of acclimation and a degradation rate after adaptation of 11% COD/day(6)."
