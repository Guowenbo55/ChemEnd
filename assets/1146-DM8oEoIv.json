The effect of the 5-vinyl derivative of oxazolidine-2-thionine was not diminished by injecting large doses of triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or TSH simultaneously, and recovery was complete within 48 hr. These compounds strongly inhibited trimethylamine oxidase in hepatic microsomes. Hence, their short-term effect on trimethylamine oxidation is probably due to inhibition of the oxidase rather than being related to their antithyroid activity."

The test concentrations were not stated, but were a geometric progression series using a factor of 1.05-1.15. A control group was included. The chamber humidity, temperature, and CO2 content (<0.2 vol %) were controlled and TMA concentration was monitored by gas chromatography. Animals were observed during exposure and for 14 days post-exposure. During exposure, the rats were initially restless but within a half hour appeared apathetic, had splayed hind- or forelimbs, inspirational dyspnea, and occasional uncoordinated movements and convulsions. During the second half-hour of exposure, the rats had marked hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) and increased apathy and intensity of central nervous system effects, which consisted of sudden convulsions or muscle tremors that interrupted the somnolent state of the animals. The rats also had prolific nasal secretions, lacrimation, hemorrhage from the corners of the eyes and nasal orifices, and cyanosis of the ears. The first deaths occurred after 2 hours of exposure, and most animals died during the 4th exposure hour, typically following convulsions; the last animal died on day 4. Post-exposure signs included severe apathy, swelling of nasal orifices, dried bloody excretions, anorexia, and general ill health. These signs disappeared rapidly in the surviving animals. The calculated LC50 values (method of Spearman and Karber and probit analysis) decreased as temperature increased, and were approximately 4350 ppm at 21.8 \u00b0C, 3910 ppm at 25.7 \u00b0C, 3840 ppm at 27.0 \u00b0C, and 3380 ppm at 29 \u00b0C. ... 82 of the rats /were histologicall examined/.

The animals were examined macroscopically and the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, skeletal muscle, and brain were examined microscopically. In the premature decedents, macroscopic abnormalities included marked blood profusion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and lung lobular hyperemia. Microscopic lung changes consisted of lobular red areas, bronchial inflammation with desquamation of the bronchial epithelium, bronchopneumonia in a few cases, and perivascular and peribronchial edema. Liver lesions included perilobular fatty liver, liver cell degeneration, and hyperemia. Most animals had lower nephron necrosis and vascular hyperemia of the kidneys, heart muscle, and many had brain edema and hyperemia. The surviving rats had few pathological changes, including one case of bronchopneumonia and three of lower nephron necrosis."

Exposure concentrations were generated by diluting TMA gas with air, and were quantitated by IR spectroscopy. Animals were observed daily for 14 days, weighed on days 0, 7, and 14, and survivors sacrificed on day 14. All animals were necropsied. The rats had decreased body weight gain primarily during the 1st week, and all groups exhibited gasping, labored breathing, rales, increased salivation, and corneal opacity immediately after exposure. The respiratory changes persisted throughout the study in only the 20 and 60 minute exposure groups, whereas corneal opacity persisted in all groups. Necropsy revealed eye lesions (cloudy cornea) in a few animals with no dose-response, and dose-related increases in the incidence of lung congestion (red, discolored lungs), which generally correlated with lethality. Lethality occurred in all groups treated for >/= 10 minutes, was generally dose-related, and primarily occurred immediately after exposure. The LC50 values [and 95% confidence limits] were 12,000 ppm [10,800-13,100 ppm] for 20 minutes and 7910 ppm [7300-8560 ppm] for 60 minutes, as calculated by the method of C.I. Bliss (1938).

Two groups of animals (12 male white rats/group) were exposed 5 hours/day to TMA at 10.4 ppm (25.0 mg/cu m) or 31.0 ppm (75.0 mg/cu m). Male rats from the third group were used as control. During exposure, air samples were taken 3-4 times a day and TMA levels determined ... . Excitation and aggressiveness were manifested for 3-4 weeks after the beginning of the experiment. For the first exposure month, diarrhea was observed during the first 2-3 hours of each exposure. Lymphocytes count decreased and the number of neutrophils increased in rats from the 31.0 ppm group beginning from the 4th exposure month onward. No statistically significant deviations between experimental and control groups were revealed when the following data were analyzed: body weight, oxygen consumption, emission of carbon dioxide, protein fractions in the blood, antitoxic function of the liver (Quick's - Pytel's Test), and the threshold for nervous and muscular excitability. Pathomorphological studies showed animals from the 10.4 ppm group exhibited bronchopneumonia and hemorrhage in the pulmonary tissue with destruction of interalveolar layers, and isolated hemorrhage in the liver, kidneys and spleen. Rats from the 10 ppm group had similar changes but they were less pronounced. The only statistically significant change in relative organ weight was an increase of the adrenal gland weight of rats exposed to 31 ppm."

Although methylamines exert several toxic effects including inhibition of protein turnover and oocyte RNA synthesis, their reproductive toxicity has not been investigated. ... /Investigators/ studied the possible developmental toxicity of these amines using pregnant CD-1 mice and mouse embryo culture as experimental models. Intraperitoneal injections (daily from day 1 to 17 of gestation) of TMA at 2.5 and 5 mmol/kg/day significantly (p<0.001) decreased fetal body weight but not the placental weight or maternal body weight gain; however, 5 of 11 mice treated with 5 mmol/kg TMA died. Similar treatment with DMA and MMA did not exert any obvious maternal or fetal effects. All three methylamines, when added to embryos in culture, caused dose-dependent decreases in size, DNA, RNA, and protein content as well as embryo survival; the order of toxicity was TMA >DMA >MMA. The ability of methylamines to adversely affect fetal development suggests that these amines, especially trimethylamine, may act as endogenous teratogens under certain conditions."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of trimethylamine can be estimated to be 7(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that trimethylamine is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of trimethylamine is 9.8(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Sorption coefficients for trimethylamine adsorption on montmorillonite, kaolinite and Flax Pond sediment (7% clay, 2.8% organic matter; Long Island, NY) were 15, 2 and 7 mL/g, respectively(5). The trimethylamine cation adsorbed strongest to the negatively-charged montmorillonite via electrostatic interactions(5)."
