Rats were killed 12 hr after dosing. The liver and kidneys were removed for analysis. Kidneys were minced, homogenized, and frozen. Kidney cytosol was prepared by ultracentrifugation of thawed kidney homogenate. The concentration of alpha-2 microglobulin (a2u-globulin) was measured in kidney cytosol from male rat kidneys using (ELISA). The renal concentration of a2u-globulin from the kidney cytosol was significantly higher in the t-BuOH treated male rats compared with corn oil treated males.  In addition, kidney cytosol was analysed by gel filtration. The a2u protein standard coeluted with the low-molecular-weight protein fraction (LMWPF). Analysis of the LMWPF from ((14)C)t-butyl alcohol treated rats demonstrated radioactivity coeluting with the male, but not female LMWPF. To determine indirectly if t-butyl alcohol binds to a2u-globulin, dialysis of kidney cytosol from ((14)C)t-butyl alcohol treated male rats was performed with d-limonene oxide, a chemical with a high affinity for a2u-globulin. Dialysis with d-limonene oxide resulted in the disappearance of radioactivity coeluting with the LMWPF. This demonstrated that d-limonene oxide displaced ((14)C)t-butyl alcohol derived radioactivity from the LMWPF and supports the hypothesis that t-BuOH interacts with a2u-globulin."

Ninety-day toxicity studies were conducted in B6C3F1 mice and Fischer 344 (F344) rats of both sexes using dosed water. Dose levels of t-butyl alcohol were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% (w/v). Lethality was observed at the 4% level of both sexes and species. Weight-gain depression was present in all dose levels of male rats; 4% female rats; 1, 2, and 4% male mice; and 2 and 4% female mice. Water consumption was increased at lower dose levels in male rats and decreased in the higher dose levels of both sexes of rats and female mice. Clinical signs in rats were ataxia in both sexes and hypoactivity in males. Clinical signs in mice were ataxia, abnormal posture, and hypoactivity. In rats, urine volumes were reduced, in association with crystalluria. Gross lesions at necropsy were urinary tract calculi, renal pelvic and ureteral dilatation, and thickening of the urinary bladder mucosa. Microscopic lesions were hyperplasia of transitional epithelia and inflammation of the urinary bladder. In male rats treated with t-butyl alcohol, microscopic renal changes were suggestive of alpha-2 mu-globulin nephropathy. No-effect levels for the urinary tract lesions were 1% in male rats and mice (803.7 mg/kg/day for the male rats and 1565.8 mg/kg/day for the male mice) and 2% in female rats and mice (1451.5 mg/kg/day for the female rats and 4362.9 mg/kg/day for the female mice).

In order to evaluate the interactive toxicity of t-butyl alcohol with trichloroacetic acid, young male Wistar rats were dosed through water at a dose level of t-butyl alcohol (TBA)-0.5% (v/v), trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-25 ppm and a combined dose of TBA + TCA (0.5% v/v TBA-25 ppm TCA) for a period of 10 weeks ad libitum and were maintained on normal diet. The control animals received plain water and normal diet. The liver and kidney histology was undertaken to see whether subtoxic administration of TBA and TCA individually as well as combined administration for a period of 10 weeks would bring about any histological alterations. It was observed that TBA, TCA and TBA + TCA caused histological alterations in the liver such as centrilobular necrosis, vacuolation in hepatocytes and loss of hepatic architecture. TBA and TBA + TCA caused periportal proliferation and lymphocytic infiltration. Hypertrophy of hepatocytes in the periportal area was a characteristic feature in the liver of TCA treated rats. Moreover, in the histology of the kidney, in the three treated groups, degeneration of renal tubules, with syncitial arrangements of the nucleus of renal tubular epithelial cells was evident. In addition to this, degeneration of the basement membrane of the Bowmans capsule, diffused glomeruli and vacuolation of glomeruli was also evident in the three treated rat kidneys. Renal tubular proliferation in certain areas was also evident in certain areas of the kidney in TCA treated rats. The results indicate that, TBA and TCA do bring about alterations in histology of liver and kidney, but on combined administration, do not show enhanced toxicity in the form of increased hepatic and renal injury."

In the 13-week study, the PWG confirmed that the normal pattern of round hyaline droplets in proximal convoluted tubules was replaced by angular droplet accumulation, and identified precursors of granular casts in the outer medulla, changes typical of alpha(2u)-globulin (a(2u)-g) nephropathy. In the 2-year study, the PWG confirmed the NTP observation of increased renal tubule tumors in treated male groups. Linear papillary mineralization, another hallmark of the a(2u)-g pathway was present only in treated male rats. Chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) was exacerbated in high-dose males and females, with a relationship between advanced grades of CPN and renal tumor occurrence. Hyperplasia of the papilla lining was a component of CPN in both sexes, but there was no pelvic urothelial hyperplasia. High-dose females showed no TBA-related nephrotoxicity. The PWG concluded that both a(2u)-g nephropathy and exacerbated CPN modes of action were operative in TBA renal tumorigenicity in male rats, neither of which has relevance for human cancer risk."

Males given 2% t-BuOH consumed 34% less water than the controls in the first week and 28% less than the controls in the second week, whereas the males given 1% t-butyl alcohol consumed 29% less in the first week and 7% less than the controls in the second week. The females given 1% and 2% t-butyl alcohol drank less water in the first week than the controls, but drank 12% and 18% more in the second week.  All the control and treated mice survived the study period and were in good physical condition at termination with the exception of one female mouse (dose unspecified) in which the caudate lobe of the liver was atrophied. No gross pathological changes were found in the treated or control mice. It was therefore concluded that t-butyl alcohol did not cause gross organ or tissue damage at the doses used in this study."

The intensity of the withdrawal reaction increased with the duration of inhalation and with the blood-tert-butanol levels maintained during the intoxication period.

Control mice were fed only the liquid diet. The 1% t-butyl alcohol group was fed ad libitum. The other groups were pair-fed based on the consumption of the 1% t-butyl alcohol group.

Approximately one-half of the maternal animals in each group were replaced with untreated surrogate mothers within 24 hr of delivery of litters to determine the role of maternal nutritional and behavioral factors on the young. Length of gestation, gross structural abnormalities, and number of deaths were recorded. Weight measurements, pinna detachment, eye opening, and behavioral test scores for the young were determined various times during days 2 to 22 postparturition.  The total number of litters from 15 animals was 11 (77%) in the control group, 12 (80%) in the 0.5% t-BuOH group, 8 (53%) in the 0.75% group, and 7 (47%) in the 1% group.
