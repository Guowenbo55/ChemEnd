    "Description": "Bensulfuron-methyl is the methyl ester of bensulfuron. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used as a herbicide for the control of a variety of both annual and perennial weeds in crops, particularly wheat and rice. It is not licensed for use within the UK. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of pyrimidines, a methyl ester and an aromatic ether. It is functionally related to a bensulfuron.",

In Trial 1, the susceptible cultivar group exhibited higher rates of root absorption per seedling, per unit dry weight, and the rate of translocation from root to shoot, reaching values of 102%, 113%, 115%, 127%, and 113% respectively, compared to the tolerant cultivar group. In Trial 2, regardless of the leaf stage, the susceptible cultivar (cv. IR 1846) demonstrated higher absorption per seedling and per unit dry weight compared to the tolerant cultivar (cv. Chinsurah Boro II). However, when analyzing different portions of the plants, the tolerant cultivar showed a higher rate of absorption in the roots, while the susceptible cultivar exhibited a higher rate in the shoots. Additionally, the translocation rate from root to shoot, based on the individual seedling's radioactivity in the shoot relative to the total radioactivity, was significantly higher in the susceptible cultivar compared to the tolerant cultivar. This suggests that the susceptible cultivar (cv. IR 1846), despite similar rates of absorption and translocation, appeared to be more sensitive due to its higher rate of seedling growth during the chemical treatment.",

            "content": "The uptake and distribution of bensulfuron methyl, the active ingredient in the \"Londax\" herbicide, were examined in rice roots and shoots. When roots were directly exposed to a solution containing 14C-bensulfuron methyl (short-term uptake), a considerable amount of 14C material was taken up by the roots. However, in a simulated paddy environment where rice was grown in soil (long-term uptake), the shoots tended to accumulate more 14C material than the roots. Extraction of 14C material from the roots and shoots of plants exposed to bensulfuron methyl for 24 hours revealed that the compound was rapidly metabolized by the shoots but not by the roots. The shoots converted 72% of the accumulated 14C material into a polar metabolite, while in the roots, 76% of the extracted 14C was associated with the parent compound. These findings suggest that rice roots have the capacity to accumulate bensulfuron methyl to a significant extent when directly exposed to the compound. However, in the paddy ecosystem, where soil binding kinetics play a role, there is relatively less uptake of bensulfuron methyl by the roots compared to the shoots when plants are grown in soil. It is noteworthy that bensulfuron methyl is commonly used on direct-seeded Indica rice with minimal crop phytotoxicity observed. This indicates that root exposure to the herbicide is maximized in such cases.",

BSM is known to selectively control most annual and perennial broadleaf weeds and sedges in paddy rice. The mode of action study showed that BSM inhibits acetolactate synthase, a key enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, and rice leaves metabolize the herbicide into an inactive form. However, BSM's phytotoxic effect on rice plants has been observed in the field, particularly in japonica cultivars, which are more susceptible than indica cultivars. This growth retardation by BSM can be reduced in the field by simultaneous application of certain thiocarbamate herbicides, which increase the rate of BSM degradation in rice leaves.
