In outdoor experiments performed in small, artificial ponds, where the initial concentration of diphenyl-2-ethylhexyl phosphate was 50 ug/L, 1% to 2% of the amount applied was found to bioconcentrate in fathead minnows 18 hrs after application which decreased to 0.1% to 0.3% of the amount originally applied after 105 days(5)."

In lake water/sediment microcosm biodegradation studies, diphenyl-2-ethylhexyl phosphate underwent 5-24% ultimate biodegradation (time not stated)(2). The biodegradation half-lives for diphenyl-2-ethylhexyl phosphate in water/sediment system obtained from the Red River, Manitoba, and an eutrophic farm pond were 5.3 days and 4.5 days, respectively at 25 \u00b0C; biodegradation was only slightly slower under anaerobic conditions(3).

All animals survived the study. No adverse behavioral effects were noted for the test animals. Body weight gain in the high- and mid-dose group and males of the mid-dose group was suppressed, statistically significant in the high dose only. Food (and water) consumption was suppressed in high-dose females leading to signs of dehydration. Hematocrit and hemoglobin were reduced in a dose related and statistically significant manner. Other clinical chemistry changes indicate liver, kidney, testes and ovary changes. There was a dose-related, statistically significant increase in relative and absolute liver weight in both sexes. The liver weight changes were accompanies by histopathologic changes consistent with enzyme induction. All treated animals showed dose-related statistically-significant and increased adrenal weights which were accompanied by an increase in vacuolated cells of the mid- and high-dose animals. There were changes (increases) in kidney, teste and brain weight but without histopathological findings. High-dose females showed hyperplasia of the interstitial gland cells in ovaries. The NOAEL was <0.2% dietary 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (S-141) (approx. 160 mg/kg/day for males and 174 mg/kg/day for females)."
