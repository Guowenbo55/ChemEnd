The aim of the study was evaluating the effects of DGBE administered by gavage on the estrous cycle and given with drinking water on fertility in rats and early development of their progeny.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Female rats were exposed to DGBE by gavage during 8 weeks at 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day. Vaginal smears were collected during the exposure and 4 weeks after its cessation. Fertility studies were performed in male and female animals exposed to in drinking water. Males were exposed for 10 weeks and then mated with females exposed before mating, during pregnancy and lactation. Young animals were observed during 3 weeks after birth.  RESULTS:  DGBE does not cause disturbances of the menstrual cycle in females. Parameters used to assess the general toxicity indicate that males receiving DGBE in drinking water are more sensitive to this compound than females: significantly greater, dose-dependent relative spleen weight, significant decrease in hematological parameters from 8% to 15% depending on the dose, were observed. Clinical chemistry parameters (HDL-cholesterol, BUN) and some markers of oxidative stress differ between the exposed groups and the control one, but without adverse health effect. The microscopic examination of internal organs did not reveal morphological changes in male and female rats.  CONCLUSION:  The results of our study on the impact of exposure to DGBE on fertility in rats indicate that the substance administered for 9-10 weeks to females and males at a limit dose of 1000 mg/kg did not impair fertility or viability of their offspring during the first three weeks of life."

CD-rats were administered 2 milliliters/kilogram of 10, 30 or 100% DGBE on an area of clipped skin, 5 consecutive days per week (wk) for 13 wk prior to necropsy. Vaginal smears were taken near the end of the study to determine whether normal estrous cycling was taking place. Blood and tissues were examined histologically. In a fertility study, rats were treated with 100% DGBE; males were treated daily throughout the study, and females were treated daily during the mating period and through gestation day 20. Rats were allowed to nurse offspring through weaning. Results showed that DGBE produced dermal irritation which was concentration dependent and was more severe in females. No histopathologic changes were evident in the testes or vaginal cytology, the only systemic effect being a slight increase in urinary occult blood in females treated with high doses of DGBE. There was no adverse effect on estrous cycling. The litters of treated females carried the same number of live pups as did control litters. The growth and survival of pups in the treated litters was similar to those in the control groups. The authors conclude that when exposed through the dermal route, the potential for subchronic, reproductive, and developmental toxicity to DGBE is low."

On day 20 of pregnancy, rats from each dosage group were sacrificed. Other rats in each group were allowed to deliver spontaneously.

Maternal weight gain in each treatment group was significantly different from controls, even though there was no decrease in food intake. The incidences of preimplantation and postimplantation losses, the numbers of corpora lutea per litter, implantations per litter and live fetuses per litter, the sex ratio of live fetuses, the fetal body weight of both sexes, and the placental weight did not differ from control values.

A functional observation battery (FOB) including hindlimb splay, and hindlimb and forelimb grip strengths was developed previously, and applied to the test animals. Motor activity was monitored. At the end of the trials the rats were sacrificed, and nervous system tissues and kidneys were examined histologically. The FOB and motor activity assessments did not reveal any treatment related effects. The absolute and relative organ weights of the DGBE treated rats were comparable to control levels. No changes in brain size were evident. Histological examinations did not reveal any neuropathology other than a slight degeneration at various sites in the central and peripheral nervous systems of both treated and control animals, which were apparently typical for rats of the age groups tested.

The in-vitro test was the Chinese-hamster-ovary (CHO) cell forward gene mutation at the hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) locus. Mutation frequencies were statistically evaluated by pairwise tests comparing each dose level to a negative control, and by linear and quadratic trend analysis. The in-vivo assay used the CD-1 mouse bone marrow micronucleus test for evaluation of cytogenetic damage. Polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) were examined to determine the incidence of micronucleated (MN) PCE, and the relative proportions of PCE and normochromatic erythrocytes were estimated. Results showed that the DGBE was not toxic to CHO cells even at concentrations of 5,000 micrograms per milliliter (ug/mL). At 1,000 ug/mL, mutation assays showed that in the absence of S-9, DGBE did not significantly increase the frequencies of 6-thioguanine resistant mutants (which represented the HGPRT phenotype. At 3,000 ug/mL, DGBE induced a significantly elevated mutation rate, which however, was reduced to a nonsignificant level when compared with the historical negative value. In MN assays at 24, 48, and 72 hours post treatment, no significant effects on the incidence of MN-PCE were observed. No adverse effects on cell kinetics were recorded. The authors conclude that the micronucleus test and the CHO cell gene mutation assay do not indicate a genotoxic potential for DGBE."
