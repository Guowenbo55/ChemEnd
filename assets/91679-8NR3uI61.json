Dimepiperate, a safening agent, has a highly selective effect on clomeprop metabolism in rice plants. Clomeprop at a concentration of 10-6 M reduced shoot growth to 81% of the non-treated control, but this inhibition was reversed by the addition of 10-5 M dimepiperate. Dimepiperate did not affect the absorption rate of clomeprop in rice seedlings, nor did it enhance the translocation of 14C-clomeprop from roots to shoots or the metabolism of clomeprop to DMPA (2-(2,4-dichloro-3-methylphenoxy) propionic acid). In roots of dimepiperate-treated rice plants, the amount of the herbicidally active compound, DMPA, was slightly decreased, while the amount of the non-phytotoxic compound, 3-CH2OH-DMPA, was increased compared to untreated plants.",
