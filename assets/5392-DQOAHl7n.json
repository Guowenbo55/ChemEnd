    "Description": "Temephos is an organic sulfide that is diphenyl sulfide in which the hydrogen at the para position of each of the phenyl groups has been replaced by a (dimethoxyphosphorothioyl)oxy group. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide, an agrochemical and an ectoparasiticide. It is an organic thiophosphate, an organothiophosphate insecticide and an organic sulfide. It is functionally related to a 4,4'-thiodiphenol.",

Rapid uptake of temephos was observed and primarily intact temephos was detected. However, metabolism of the parent compound to temephos sulfoxide, was the major degradate. Detection of additional metabolites such as 4,4'-thiodiphenol, phosphorthioic acid, O-p-(p-hydroxyohenylthio)phenyl, O,O'-dimethyl ester and phosphoric acid, O-p-(p-hydroxypheny1thio)phenyl dimethyl ester were found(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC)."

Temephos did not biodegrade after incubation in a natural pond water/sediment system for 7 days(2).

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ ... Three hens/group were dosed orally with single doses of 41, 82, 163, or 326 mg/kg of Abate Mosquito Larvicide (technical) (purity: 87.1%). One hen died in the 82 mg/kg group and all 3 hens died in the 326 mg/kg group. An LD50 value of 183 mg/kg was calculated from these data. In the second study, 8 hens/group were fed diets containing 230, 460, or 920 ppm of the test material for 30 days. An additional 6 hens received 4000 ppm of TOCP in the diet for the same time period. After 30 days, 2 birds each from the control and TOCP group and 4 birds from the 920 ppm group were euthanized and the brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerves were examined histologically. The remaining birds in the 920 ppm group received the basal laboratory diet for another 4 weeks. The surviving hens in the 230 and 460 ppm groups were euthanized one week after receiving the control diet. One hen died in the 460 ppm group after 23 days of treatment. Four of the TOCP treated birds died, the first approximately 4 weeks after initiation of the study. Death was preceded by muscular weakness, paralysis and severe malnutrition. The histological examination of the TOCP treated hens revealed focal myelin loss in the medullary substance of the cerebellar hemispheres, in the fasciculus gracilis and the cuneatus of the spinal cord and in the peripheral nerve. All of the Abate treated hens lost weight during the treatment period, possibly due to the lack of palatability of the test material. Histological examination of the hens did not reveal any treatment-related lesions in the nervous system."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ ... Single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), SOS/umu and Ames/Salmonella assays /were used/ to test the toxicity and mutagenicity of temephos. Temephos was genotoxic in the SCGE assay, inducing severe DNA lesions (type IV lesions) at doses above 1.34 uM. It was mutagenic, but not toxic, in the SOS/umu assay to Escherichia coli strain PQ37, but not to PQ35, at concentrations above 1.33 uM, particularly when the S9 mixture was not used in the assay. Temephos was not mutagenic in the Ames assay with S. typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102, both with and without metabolic activation. However, temephos at concentrations above 3.33 micro M was mutagenic to TA98NR, YG7104 and YG7108, both with and without metabolic activation. In conclusion, temephos was genotoxic and mutagenic in all the three tests used, and in two of them at concentrations similar to those routinely used to combat Aedes aegypti."

            "Value": "Freundlich adsorption coefficients calculated from adsorption/desorption studies ranged from 7.3-541 for temephos and was dependant upon organic carbon content of the soil. The Koc values for temephos were measured using 14-C labeled temephos at concentrations of 5, 8, 11, and 26 ppb. The results indicated Koc values in loamy sand (Delaware) 18,250, sandy loam (Princeton) 16,250, silt loam (Nebraska) 31,800, and loam (Ontario) 22,800. Temephos adsorption to sediment steadily increased to a maximum after two days of exposure, but temephos degradation products have shown to adsorb less strongly to soils(1). According to a classification scheme(2), these Koc values suggest that temephos is expected to be immobile in soil."
