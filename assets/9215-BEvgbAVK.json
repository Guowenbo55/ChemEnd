            "Value": "In a static bioconcentration test, a BCF value of 1300 was measured in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata(1). Rate constants for uptake and depuration were 40.8 and 0.031/hour, respectively(1). An equilibrium BCF of 30 was measured for acridine in Daphnia pulex; rate constants for uptake and depuration were 109.6 and 0.47/hour, respectively(2). A BCF value of 126 was measured in fathead minnows(3). Fathead minnows, exposed to 100 ug/L acridine in a flow-through spring water system, rapidly accumulated acridine directly from the water with concentrations of about 12 ug/g wet attained in the fish after 24 hours giving a BCF of 125(4). Further exposure did not result in higher levels of acridine in these fish(4). Rate constants for uptake and depuration were 14 and 0.112/hour, respectively(4). Uncontaminated water rapidly contained measurable concentrations of acridine once minnows containing this compound were added to the water; this suggests that acridine can be eliminated without metabolic alteration as well as through metabolic degradation(4). Minnows exposed to acridine-contaminated sediment and a low level of dissolved acridine did not accumulate much acridine from the sediment(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high depending on the aquatic organism studied(SRC); however, this compound appears to be readily depurated in several organisms. Mussels, Elliptio complanata, did not accumulate detectable concentrations of acridine following three weeks exposure to contaminated sediments in the St. Mary's River in 1985 (detection limit= 1 ug/kg wet weight)(6)."

            "Value": "The biodegradation of acridine at concentrations from 0.1 to 20 mg/l was measured in river die-away tests using Green River water; over 11 days this compound was not significantly biodegraded at any measured concentration(1). Acridine at 500 mg/kg soil was measurably present for 83 days in chernozem soil samples at a temperature of 19 \u00b0C(2). A half-life of 3 days in soil was reported for acridine when present at a concentration of 5 mg/kg(3). Acridine, initially present in a groundwater sample at 22.5 ug/ml, was inoculated with creosote-contaminated surface soil; 19, 37, 91.5, 91, and 91% of this compound was biodegraded following 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 days incubation(4). The sterile control was not degraded over 14 days(4). During solid-phase bioremediation of creosote/PCP contaminated surface soils, unamended soils, containing acridine initially at 46.8 mg/landfarming chamber (3 kg) biodegraded this compound by 83% over 12 weeks(5). In similar experiments using surficial soil, 32% biodegradation was reported over 12 weeks with an initial acridine concentration of 14569.7 mg/landfarming chamber (3 kg)(5). The presence of 9-acridinone in groundwater samples possibly indicates that this compound may be the final product of the biodegradation of acridine in contaminated aquifers(6)."

            "Value": "Acridine was readily biodegraded in a mixed methanogenic culture with the initial 1 ug/ml acridine concentration reduced to 0.05 ug/ml after one week of incubation(1). After two weeks, these cultures were respiked with 5 ug/ml acridine; one week later, the acridine concentration was 0.06 ug/ml (autoclaved controls showed only 15% decrease over the same time)(1). Norman aquifer materials, taken from two strictly anaerobic zones also supported extensive degradation of acridine with 92, 96, and 97% degradation reported after 3 weeks for fermentative, denitrifying, and sulfate-reducing incubations, respectively(1). Controls exhibited 52% depletion of acridine over 3 weeks, mainly due to adsorption onto the aquifer materials(1). No breakdown products were detected in any control sample. The groups of breakdown products detected in the biodegraded samples included two-ring nitrogen heterocycles, nitrogen-substituted oxygenated homocyclic monoaromatic compounds, nonnitrogen-substituted oxygenated homocyclic aromatic compounds, monoxygenated homocyclic monoaromatic hydrocarbons, and aliphatic compounds(1). 2-Methylquinoline, phenyl-2-pentenoic acid and hexylbenzene were reported for the initial ring cleavage of acridine. Benzoic acid was detected early in the incubation period (<1 week); later in the incubation period (>5 weeks) only acetic acid, carbon dioxide and methane (in methanogenic microcosms) were detected, indicating that extensive degradation of acridine had occurred(1). In a static anaerobic digester study, using a mixed inoculum (equal parts from an anaerobic digester sludge, from an anaerobic digester treated with creosote and creosote-contaminated soil, and from a fixed-film anaerobic reactor treated with quinoline) acridine was not biodegraded over 203 days(2). In an anaerobic toxicity test, using a sewage sludge inoculum, degradation products of acridine were reported, indicating that partial degradation of this compound was occurring(2)."

Koc values for acridine added to these soils/sediments ranged from 5500 to 30,909 with an average value of 12,910(1). According to a recommended classification scheme(2), these measured Koc values suggest that acridine will be immobile in soil(SRC). Adsorption of acridine to silica was measured in a continuous-flow column. The extent of adsorption was greater when the solution pH was below the pKa of acridine(pKa= 5.68(3)) than when it was above(4). Therefore, mobility should be greater in a sand soil when the pH is above the pKa of acridine and adsorption is greatest when the solution pH equals acridine's pKa(4). Sorption of acridine to two low organic carbon subsurface materials with similar properties but different equilibrium pH values when saturated with water was measured(5). Higher sorption was reported for the Loring subsoil (0.24% organic carbon, pH 4.85) than the Anvil Points subsoil (0.58% organic carbon, pH 8.15), consistent with compound ionization and preferential retention of the organic cation over the neutral compound(5)."
