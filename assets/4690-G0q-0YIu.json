The accumulation of trifluralin in roots at 24 hr after exposure to trifluralin was greatest at 21 C and decreased at higher temperatures up to 38 C. The amounts of trifluralin translocated and accumulated in hypocotyls, tops, and cotyledons were small but generally increased with temperature. The initial rate of absorption of trifluralin was greater in excised lateral root tips than in tap root tips, but there was a greater accumulation in excised tap roots at 24 hr. The initial rates of absorption were higher for excised lateral roots at high temperatures. Total absorption of trifluralin at equilibrium was not proportional to the initial rates of absorption but was highest at low (21 C) and high (38 C) temperatures for excised lateral roots. The absorption of methazole by roots and translocation to other plant parts increased linearly with temperature, and it tended to accumulate in the mature leaf tissue.",

Significantly greater methazole concentrations occurred in cotton from treatments to stems of 18 to 22-cm tall cotton than to leaves of 10 to 12-cm tall cotton or when applied preemergence. The radiolabel translocated primarily into the mature stems and leaves with lesser amounts translocating into the roots. Little 14C moved into the young growing points or into the seed and fiber of mature cotton. The distribution pattern of the 14C-label is characteristic of compounds which move primarily in the apoplast.\n",
