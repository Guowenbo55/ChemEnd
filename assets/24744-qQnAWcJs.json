            "Value": "Using several different soils, an Rf value of 0.17 was measured via soil thin-layer chromatography which is indicative of low soil mobility(1). Based upon a water solubility of 4.7 mg/L at 25 \u00b0C(2), the Koc of betanal can be estimated to be about 1860 from a regression derived equation(3,SRC). The US Dept Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a Koc value of 2400 for betanal(2). According to a suggested classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that betanal has low mobility in soil(SRC). Betanal is reported to remain in the top layers of soil (0 to 2 inches) after herbicidal application(5). In a field study in sugar beet soil, applications of betanal remained in the upper 10 cm of soil 2 months after application(6)."

Wild mustard showed severe inhibition of total photosynthesis within 5 hours of herbicide application, with no recovery, while sugar beet exhibited slight inhibition but recovered after 24 hours. Redroot pigweed recovered from phenmedipham treatment but not from desmedipham treatment. Differences in spray retention or foliar absorption did not explain selectivity. Redroot pigweed translocated more desmedipham than phenmedipham and metabolized more phenmedipham than desmedipham within 5 hours of application. The initial detoxication reaction of the parent compound appeared to be the key factor explaining selectivity.",
