            "Value": "1.8-Cineole is considered a major monoterpene emitted by vegetation into the atmosphere; monoterpene emission rate estimates for 49 US tree genera range from 1 to 50 mg C-sq m/hr(1). The compound has been identified as an emission from agricultural and natural plant species present in California's Central Valley(2). 1,8-Cineole emission concentrations were 225, 280, 145, and 150 nmol/sq m-min from Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E globulus, E grandis and E viminalis, respectively, in southern Australia(3). 1,8-Cineole with limonene was emitted at rates of 10%, 1% and 1% of the total biogeneic volatile compounds identified from the leaves of Eucalyptus dunnii, E. saligna and E. citriodora, respectively, originating from Guaiba, Brazil collected during May and Jun 2000(4). Evaluation of ambient air around Eucalyptus globulus trees growing in Algiers City area, Algeria revealed 1,8-cineole present at 15.2% of total biogenic volatile emissions. It was not detected in emissions from Pinus halepensis or Cedrus atlantica trees(5). Emission rates of 1,8-cineole from forests in five geographical regions in Switzerland were monitored. Biogenic volatile organic compounds comprise 23% of total annual emissions in Switzerland. The Norway spruce (Picea abies) is the dominant tree at 49.1%; 1,8-cineole is a component of Norway spruce emissions(6). 1,8-Cineole was present at 8.54% of total emissions measured in 3 hours from a Mediterranean oak species Quercus ilex(7)."

Menthol proved the most effective antitussive--10 and 30 ug/L produced a significant 28 and 56% reduction in cough frequency--500 ug/L camphor gave a significant 33% reduction, while cineole, at the concentrations used, had no significant effect. An increase in cough latency coincided with a reduction in cough frequency. These results demonstrate the efficacy of aromatic vapors as antitussives in chemically induced cough."

Limonene, a rapidly metabolized terpene, also showed significant inhibition, while pinene and camphene were without effect. This inhibition of reductase correlated well with inhibition of C2-flux into non-saponifiable lipid (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). There were no changes in a variety of other microsomal membrane activities, indicating that the effect was specific rather than due to generalized hepatoxicity.

Cineole was administered by gavage to three groups, each of five male and five female Wistar Han:RccHan:WIST strain rats, for twenty-eight consecutive days, at dose levels of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day. A control group of five males and five females was dosed with vehicle alone (Arachis oil BP) over the same treatment period. Two recovery groups, each of five males and five females, were treated with the high dose (600 mg cineole /kg bw/day) or the vehicle alone for twenty-eight consecutive days and then maintained without treatment for a further fourteen days. Clinical signs, body weight change, food and water consumption were monitored during the study. Hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis were evaluated for all non-recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period and for all recovery group animals at the end of the treatment-free period.  There were no unscheduled deaths on the study. Clinical signs were restricted to post-dosing salivation with two males and all five females at 300 mg/kg bw/day and all males and females at 1000 mg/kg bw/day being affected. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. No findings considered to represent an adverse effect of treatment were observed. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. At 600 mg/kg bw/day slightly lower mean body weight gain of males than control was observed for Week 1, differences attaining statistical significance. No adverse effect of treatment was observed for females at this dosage or either sex at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. For females at 600 mg/kg bw/day water consumption was notably lower than control on the first day of treatment. Water intake for males at this dosage and for either sex at 30 or 300 mg/kg bw/day appeared unaffected by treatment. For males at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day mean platelet count at the end of the treatment period was higher than control with differences attaining statistical significance. There were no differences in blood chemistry parameters that were considered to represent an adverse effect of treatment. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. At 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, male absolute and body weight-relative kidney weights were statistically significantly increased at the end of the treatment period compared to control.  An statistically significant increase in absolute and body weight-relative liver weights, considered to be associated with adaptive liver changes, was observed at the end of treatment period for females at 30 mg/kg bw/day and both sexes at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, in comparison to control. Higher liver weights were still apparent at the end of the recovery period and attained statistical significance in comparison to control. For males at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day at the end of treatment, examination of the kidneys revealed an increased severity of hyaline droplets in the proximal tubules, accompanied at the high dosage with sporadic tubular cell degeneration. An increased mean severity of multifocal tubular basophilia and/or interstitial mononuclear cell foci were observed in association with renal tubules where hyaline droplets were excessively deposited was also observed at these dosages. For males at 600 mg/kg bw/day, following the treatment-free recovery period, these treatment-related findings decreased in severity. For both sexes at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, examination of the liver revealed a dosage dependent incidence of centrilobular hypertrophy of the hepatocytes; no other indicators of liver damage was apparent. Following the two week recovery period, hypertrophy of hepatocytes was no longer present at 600 mg/kg bw/day for either sex. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for the female rat was considered to be 600 mg/kg bw/day but for the male rat was only 30 mg/kg bw/day.   However, the adverse findings observed for males were characterized by renal changes specific to the male rat and of no toxicological relevance to man.   Excluding these renal changes, the NOAEL was 600 mg/kg bw/day and this represents the most appropriate dosage for any assessment of the risk to human health."

A control group of three males and three females was dosed with vehicle alone (Arachis oil BP). Clinical signs, body weight change, dietary intake and water consumption were monitored during the study. All animals were subjected to gross necropsy examination. There were no unscheduled deaths on the study. At 750 mg/kg bw/day, ataxia was observed for two females on Day 2, ataxia was again observed for one female on Days 10 and 14. Transient post-dosing salivation was observed on isolated occasions for all animals receiving 750 mg/kg bw/day from Day 7. Similar transient post-dosing salivation was observed on isolated occasions for all males from Day 7 and one female on Day 10 at 500 mg/kg bw/day the study. At 250 mg/kg/day all males and two females showed transient post-dosing salivation on isolated occasions from Day 9. This finding was considered to reflect distaste of the test item formulations rather than any adverse effect of treatment. Body Weight. At 500 and 750 mg/kg bw/day male body weight gain was lower than control, and females showed slight body weight loss to Day 4. Thereafter, body weight gains were similar to control although overall body weight gain at termination remained lower for both sexes at 750 mg/kg bw/day and males at 500 mg/kg bw/day. At 250 mg/kg bw/day body weight and body weight gain for either sex was unaffected by treatment. There were no adverse effects of treatment on food consumption for either sex at 250, 500 or 750 mg/kg bw/day. Food Conversion Efficiency. At 500 and 750 mg/kg bw/day food utilisation of both sexes was inferior to control during Day 1-4, thereafter food conversion efficiency for both sexes was unaffected by treatment. There were no adverse effects of treatment on food conversion efficiency for either sex at 250 mg/kg bw/day. Water Consumption. At 750 mg/kg bw/day water intake was higher than control throughout the treatment period for males and during Week 2 for females. Water consumption for either sex was unaffected by treatment at 250 or 500 mg/kg bw/day. Necropsy. No macroscopic abnormalities were detected at terminal necropsy for either sex at 250, 500 or 750 mg/kg bw/day. Conclusion. Although the effects on body weight and food observed at 750 mg/kg bw/day were not marked, the sporadic occurrence of ataxia among female animals was considered to preclude this dosage from any further, more long term, investigation of toxicity."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Cineole was administered by gavage to three groups, each of ten male and ten female Wistar Han (TM): RCCHan(TM): WIST strain rats, for up to eleven weeks (including a two week pre-pairing phase, pairing, gestation and early lactation for females) at dose levels of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day. A control group of ten males and ten females was dosed with vehicle alone (Arachis oil BP).  Clinical signs, bodyweight change, dietary intake and water consumption were monitored during the study.  Pairing of animals within each dose group was undertaken on a one male: one female basis within each treatment group on Day 5 of the study, with females subsequently being allowed to litter and rear their offspring to Day 5 of lactation. An additional pairing for high dose females that failed to achieve pregnancy was performed to fully assess mating performance and fertility.  During the lactation phase, daily clinical observations were performed on all surviving offspring, together with litter size and offspring weights and assessment of surface righting reflex.  Adult males were terminated on Day 52 of the study following the completion of the second pairing at 600 mg/kg bw/day. Females and offspring were terminated on day 5 post partum. Any female which did not produce a pregnancy (unless allocated to a further mating phase) was terminated on or after Day 25 post coitum. All animals were subjected to a gross necropsy examination and histopathological evaluation of reproductive tissues was performed. Additional male organ weight and detailed histopathological examination of the testes were performed to more fully assess male fertility. Adult response:  Mortality: There were no unscheduled deaths in the study.    Clinical observations: Transient post-dosing salivation was observed from Day 7 at 600 mg/kg bw/day and Day 13 at 300 mg/kg bw/day. This sign was observed regularly throughout the treatment period with all animals being affected at both dosages, although the incidence of this finding was greatest at the high dosage. Transient post dosing salivation was also observed at 30 mg/kg bw/day for two females on Day 2 and one male on Day 50 of this study.    Bodyweight: At 600 mg/kg bw/day body weight gain of males was statistically significantly lower than control during the first week of treatment. Subsequent body weight gains were considered to reflect normal biological varaition, but overall gain at termination remained lower than control.  Bodyweight gain of males at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day and for females at all dosages, throughout the pre-pairing, gestation and lactation phases of the study, were considered to have been unaffected by treatment.    Food consumption: Food consumption for both sexes was considered to have been unaffected by treatment throughout the study, and including gestation and lactation phases for females, at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Food efficiency: At 600 mg/kg bw/day food conversation efficiency for males was lower than control during week 1; subsequent food utilisation was similar to control.  Food conversation efficiency of males at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day and for females at all dosages, throughout the pre-pairing, gestation and lactation phases of the study, were considered to have been unaffected by the treatment.    Reproductive performance:  Mating: Pre-coital interval and mating evidence at the times of conception did not indicate any adverse effect of treatment on mating performance at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Fertility: At 600 mg/kg bw/day, only seven females delivered a litter following the initial pairing but subsequent re-mating and additional assessment of male organ weight and detailed testicular histopathology did not indicate any treatment related effect on fertility for either sex. There was also no effect of treatment on fertility at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day.    Gestation lengths: Gestation length was considered to be unaffected by treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Litter responses:  Offspring litter size, sex ratio and viability: There was no effect of maternal treatment on corpora lutea and implantations counts, pre- and post-implantation loss, number of offspring born, sex ratio or subsequent survival to Day 4 of age at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Offspring growth and development: At 600 mg/kg bw/day initial offspring body weight was similar to control but weight gain to Day 4 was statistically significantly lower than control.  Mean offspring body weights, litter weight and weight gains to Day 4 of age were unaffected by maternal treatment at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day.    Offspring observations: Assessment of surface righting ability on Day 1; offspring clinical signs and necropsy findings and did not indicate any effect of maternal treatment.    Pathology:  Necropsy: Macroscpoic necropsy findings did not indicate any effect of treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Organ weights: Male reproductive organ weights were unaffected by treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day and did not indicate any effect on fertility.    Histopathology: Histopathological examinations did not indicate any effect of treatment at 600 mg/kg bw/day and these examinations, including detailed assessment of the spermatogenetic cycle for the testes did not indicate any effect on male fertility. Within the context of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for adult toxicity, reproduction and offspring survival, growth and development was considered to be 600 mg/kg bw/day."

This study examined postnatal intake of a chemosensory cue (cineole) that had been paired with alcohol's unconditioned effects. It also tested the interaction between prenatal association and postnatal conditioning with cineole and alcohol. Pregnant female rats intubated with cineole were given ethanol (EtOH).25 or 4.0 hr later. Other groups received only water or water paired with ethanol. During postnatal day 15 (PD15), infant consumption of cineole solution was assessed. After the cineole drinking test, pups were intubated with EtOH or water to assess infant conditioning. On PD16, all pups were tested for mouthing to milk alone or to a milk-cineole solution. Statistical analysis confirmed fetal associative conditioning attributable to the unconditioned effects of prenatal alcohol. Fetuses given explicit pairings of cineole and alcohol ingested less cineole on PD15 than control fetuses given a 4-hr interval between cineole and alcohol. On PD16, consumption of cineole was significantly increased by prenatal exposure to cineole. Teratogenic effects of this dose of prenatal alcohol did not affect postnatal associative or nonassociative behavior. Prenatal associative learning can be established through temporal contiguity between fetal chemosensory stimulation and alcohol's unconditioned properties. This associative memory survives to infancy and modulates intake patterns and behavioral reactivity to substances that were prenatally paired with alcohol intoxication."

Brushtail possums were acclimated to a non-Eucalyptus diet with increasing concentrations of cineole (0.5-4.0% wet weight) added over 18 d. We measured food and cineole consumption and urinary metabolites of cineole. Food intake decreased with cineole content, indicating that it was constrained by the maximum tolerable intake of cineole that was 3.8 +/- 0.2 g kg(-1) or 5.2 +/- 0.3 g kg(-0.75) (mean +/- SE, N = 6). The pattern of metabolites was similar at all cineole intakes (56% hydroxycineolic acids, 27% cineolic acids, 13% hydroxycineoles, and 4% dihydroxycineoles). In another experiment, possums maintained on artificial diet were abruptly presented with 4% cineole for 5 d. Food intake fell by 45 +/- 6% (mean +/- SE, N = 6) and mean cineole intake was 2.9 +/- 0.3 g kg(-1). There was evidence of induction of secondary oxidative pathways, as hydroxycineoles were the major metabolites (48% total) on the first day, but rapidly dropped to 15% on subsequent days as the acid metabolites increased. These findings indicate that ingestion of cineole is not constrained by selective saturation of individual enzymes involved in its multiple pathways of oxidation, but rather the total detoxification capacity appears to limit feeding on a cineole diet."
