    "Description": "Fluometuron is a member of the class of 3-(3,4-substituted-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylureas that is urea in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group while the other is substituted by two methyl groups. It is a herbicide used for the control of broadleaf weeds and annual grasses in cotton. It has a role as an agrochemical, an environmental contaminant, a herbicide, a xenobiotic and a photosystem-II inhibitor. It is a 3-(3,4-substituted-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes.",

            "Value": "An estimated BCF of 15 was calculated for fluometuron(SRC), using a log Kow of 2.42 (1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. However, in a study of unicellular green algae (Chlorella fusca), a log BCF of 1.96(4) was determined for fluometuron, corresponding to a BCF of 91.2 and indicating a moderate potential for bioconcentration in algae."

A slight but measurable amount of radioactivity (< 5% of the dose applied) evolved as carbon dioxide during the 52 day observation period on incubation of the (14)C trifluoromethyl-labeled herbicide in soils. Oxidation of the trifluoromethyl carbon represents a minor pathway of degradation for fluometuron in the soil."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Several pure cultures of microorganisms degrade fluometuron(1-2). The biodegradation proceeds by two successive dealkylation to the corresponding 3-(trifluoromethylphenyl) urea which then hydrolyze to the corresponding aniline(1,3). Mixed populations of microorganisms from two soils also metabolized fluometuron in a similar way and the 3-(trifluoromethyl) aniline formed was immediately acetylated to the corresponding acetanilide(4). The release of carbon dioxide observed during the biodegradation of fluometuron(5) may at least be partly the result of the hydrolysis of phenylurea to the aromatic amine and not from ring cleavage(4). The half-life of fluometuron in unsterilized surface soil in the dark was 18 days compared to 315 days in sterilized soil(6). Biodegradation has also been observed in cover crop residues on the soil surface(7). In annual ryegrass, fluometuron was demethylated, at rates similar to those in soils, when the crop had high (78%) moisture conditions(7). The half-life of fluometuron was 189 days for aerobic microbial metabolism in a sandy loam soil at 25 \u00b0C(8). The major degradation product under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was mono-N-demethylated fluometuron. Microbial metabolism is the most important contributor to field dissipation, but rates are moderate(8). In soil, microbial degradation is significant and rapid, with continual liberation of carbon dioxide(9)."

The Koc for fluometuron ranges from 29 to 200 for various soil types (including sandy and loam soils)(11). It is moderately leachable in all but very sandy soils; the Koc value range from 31 to 117 (8 soil types); Kd = 0.15 to 1.13(12).

However, snapbean plants (sensitive) absorbed and translocated more 14C to the shoots than cotton (tolerant), followed by rapid distribution in the leaf mesophyll tissue. In cotton, the translocated 14C-terbutryn accumulated in stems, petioles, and leaf veins. Excised cotton roots absorbed more 14C-terbutryn than excised snapbean roots. The uptake and distribution pattern of root-applied 14C-fluometuron was similar in both species. Foliar application to the primary leaf of snapbeans and to one cotyledon of cotton resulted in 2% of 14C-terbutryn transported acropetally to younger leaves with no basipetal movement. Translocation of 14C-fluometuron from the site of foliar application was two or three times faster than terbutryn with significant basipetal transport in both species.",
