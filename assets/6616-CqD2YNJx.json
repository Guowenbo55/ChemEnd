Camphene was detected in Scots pine emissions from boreal forests in Finland and Sweden(1). Concentrations were not reported. Balkan pine (Pinus peuce) twig oil and needle oil contain 0.24 percent and 5.52 percent camphene, respectively; samples were collected from 25 to 100 year old tress in the forests of northern Greece during November 1997(6). Camphene was detected in the emissions of 35 out of 63 vegetation species in forests near Atlanta, GA, Rhinelander, WI, and Hayden CO(7). Measured camphene emission rates from these species ranged from 0.1 to 39 ug/hr-gdw with an average rate of 3.1 ug/hr-gdw during the summer of 1993. The mass percentage of camphene in Douglas Fir trees from Socorro, NM and from the nearby Magdalena Mountains during the summer of 1996 was 20 percent(8).

We evaluated the safety of C. indicum flower oil by conducting acute oral toxicity, bone marrow micronucleus, and bacterial reverse mutation tests. Mortality, clinical signs and gross findings of mice were measured for 15 days after the oral single gavage administration of C. indicum flower oil. There were no mortality and clinical signs of toxicity at 2,000 mg/kg body weight/day of C. indicum flower oil throughout the 15 day period. Micronucleated erythrocyte cell counts for all treated groups were not significantly different between test and control groups. Levels of 15.63~500 ug C. indicum flower oil/plate did not induce mutagenicity in S. typhimurium and E. coli, with or without the introduction of a metabolic activation system. These results indicate that ingesting C. indicum flower oil produces no acute oral toxicity, bone marrow micronucleus, and bacterial reverse mutation. /Chrysanthemum indicum flower oil/"
