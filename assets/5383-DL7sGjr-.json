Four hours later, 14C was detected in all sections of winged elm treated with 14C-tebuthiuron and 14C-hexazinone. Root absorption of the tebuthiuron label by the other species occurred in the order: loblolly pine > bur oak > black walnut = eastern redcedar. The sequence of 14C-hexazinone absorption was: loblolly pine > black walnut \u2265 bur oak = eastern redcedar. Foliar accumulation of the tebuthiuron label occurred in the order: bur oak > loblolly pine > eastern redcedar = black walnut, whereas the sequence with hexazinone was loblolly pine > bur oak > black walnut = eastern redcedar. The presence of the three metabolites of hexazinone in loblolly pine suggests that it may be resistant to hexazinone as a result of its ability to degrade hexazinone rather than its ability to limit uptake.",
