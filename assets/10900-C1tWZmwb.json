When trans-1,2-dichloroethylene was incubated under anaerobic conditions with methanogenic aquifer material obtained adjacent to a landfill site in a serum bottle at 17 \u00b0C, at least 16 weeks of incubation were required before disappearance began relative to autoclaved controls, whereas the concentration of the cis- isomer was reduced to <2% of controls during the same period(2). Vinyl chloride was identified as a degradation product after 1-2 weeks(2). After 40 weeks, the average concentration of the trans-isomer was reduced to 18% of controls, only traces of the cis-isomer remained, and no vinyl chloride or other degradation product were found(2). Another investigator found that when cis- or trans-1,2-dichloroethylene were incubated anaerobically using an inoculum from a municipal waste digester in order to simulate conditions in a landfill, vinyl chloride appeared within 6 weeks(3). Biodegradation of 1,2-dichloroethylene was studied in microcosms prepared from uncontaminated organic sediment from the Everglades and allowed to sit to insure oxygen depletion(4). Under these anoxic conditions, 50% and 73% of the cis- and trans-isomer, respectively, were lost in 6 months with accompanying formation of vinyl chloride(4). Ethyl chloride was formed in the case of the cis- but not the trans-isomer, indicating that there is at least one pathway other than the reductive dechlorination for the cis-isomer(4). Mineralization of C14-labeled 1,2-dichloroethylene (mixture of 20% trans- and 71% cis-isomer) was observed under anaerobic conditions in streambed sediments characterized by a high content of natural organic matter (2.5% dry mass organic content) and saturated with humic acid-laden black water(5). 7% Of C14-labeled CO2 was recovered in 50 days for unamended sediments(5), which corresponds to a first-order half-life of 478 days(SRC); 25% of C14-labeled CO2 was recovered in 50 days for sediments amended with 2 mg humic acid/L(5), which corresponds to a first-order half-life of 121 days(SRC); humic acids are believed to serve as electron acceptors in the anaerobic oxidation 1,2-dichloroethylene(5)."

Haziness was observed in both corneas of one dog after the second exposure and slight haziness of one eye of another dog after fourteen exposures, but no ocular disturbance was found in the third dog. A more detailed study subsequently showed that the corneal haziness occuring in dogs was attributable to many fine gray flecks in the endothelium, and that this usually cleared in twenty-four hours, or forty-eight hours at the most."

In addition to the animals receiving daily 7-hour exposures, separate groups of 10 male rats were exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m 1,2-DCE for 4, 2, or 1 hour(s)/day for a total duration of 5 months. In all studies, each animal was weighed twice per week until growth was determined to be normal; afterwards, each animal was weighed once per week. Hematological analyses and clinical chemistry determinations were performed on all rabbits, on five male and five female rats exposed to 3,960 mg/cu m, and on all dogs exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m. Rats and rabbits exposed to 3,960 mg/cu m of 1,2-DCE, 7 hours/day (136 exposures in 195 days) did not exhibit increased mortality or clinical signs of toxicity. Growth of animals was normal, and final body weights and weights of lungs, heart, spleen, and testes were not significantly different from controls. Hematology and biochemical values were within normal limits. The average relative kidney weight (expressed as a ratio of kidney weight to body weight) in male and female rats were increased by 16 and 9%, respectively (statistically significant only in the males). The average relative liver weight in female rats (expressed as a ratio of liver weight to body weight) was statistically significantly increased by 23%. Liver weight in both male and female rabbits were also increased, but statistical significance was not determined because of the small number of rabbits tested. Rats exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m of 1,2-DCE, 7 hours/day, for 6 months did not demonstrate excess mortality or adverse clinical effects. Hematology and clinical chemistry values were within normal limits. Terminal body weights and relative lung, heart, spleen, and testes weight were not significantly different from controls, but relative kidney weight of male and female rats were increased by 9 and 18%, respectively (statistically significant only in the male rats). Liver weights of female rats were significantly increased by 19%. No noteworthy effects on mortality, behavior, or appearance were observed in the guinea pigs exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m on 81 of 117 days. Final average body weights and organ weights were not significantly different from controls. Rabbits exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m for 131 exposures in 181 days exhibited no effects, except that increases in liver weights of both male and female rabbits occurred at termination (statistical evaluations were not performed because of the small number of experimental animals). Female dogs exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m tolerated 129 exposures in 183 days without biologically significant effects. Clinical chemistry and hematology data were essentially identical to values obtained prior to initiation of the 1,980 mg/cu m exposure regimen. In rats exposed to 1,980 mg/cu m 1,2-DCE for shorter periods of 4, 2, or 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 5 months (136 exposures in a period of 195 days), no clinical or behavioral abnormalities were seen, and final body weight and organ weight data were not significantly different from control values.

All treatments produced evident clinical symptoms, but no marked depression of bone marrow proliferation. No statistically significant increases in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes over the control values were observed at any sampling time with any of the 10 halogenated hydrocarbons assayed. The comparison of the results obtained in this study with the findings provided by in vitro micronucleus assays on the same chemicals, reported by other authors, indicate that mouse bone marrow is weakly sensitive to the genotoxic effects induced by halogenated hydrocarbons in other test systems. This suggests that the role of such an assay in carcinogen screening may be questionable for this chemical class. An examination of mouse bone marrow micronucleus test results with the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons classified as carcinogens by IARC supports this conclusion."
