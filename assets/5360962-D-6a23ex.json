The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by measuring shoot growth rate and assessing adult leafhopper mortality. In the laboratory, leafhoppers collected from the field were placed on detached peach leaves for 24 hours. Residues of the insecticides and their sulphoxide and sulphone metabolites were analyzed in the peach tree leaves 18 and 31 days after treatment. Only the sulphoxide and sulphone metabolites were detected, constituting 70-80% of the toxic residues after 18 days and 50-70% after 31 days. Peach leaves treated with aldicarb had higher concentrations of these toxic metabolites and exhibited greater toxicity to leafhoppers compared to leaves treated with butocarboxim, even when the application rate was identical.",
