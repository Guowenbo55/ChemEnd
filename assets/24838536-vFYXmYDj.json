Glyphosate was applied at 250 g ai ha\u22121. Absorption of 14C-glyphosate in both formulations increased similarly in both species over 72 h. Seventy-two hours after treatment (HAT), A. theophrasti absorbed 26% of applied 14C of both formulations, whereas S. faberi absorbed 43% of both formulations. The addition of 1% ammonium sulfate (AMS) to both formulations increased the amount of herbicide absorbed to 35% in A. theophrasti and 60% in S. faberi 72 HAT. Translocation of absorbed 14C-glyphosate in both formulations (with or without AMS) was greater for S. faberi than A. theophrasti 72 HAT. For A. theophrasti, 17% of 14C absorbed in Ipa and Tms formulations were translocated out of the treated leaf, whereas additions of AMS increased the amount translocated to 25 and 23% for Ipa and Tms, respectively. The largest portion of translocated 14C moved to tissues above the treated leaf. For S. faberi, 37% of absorbed 14C in both Ipa and Tms formulations were translocated out of the treated leaf 72 HAT, whereas 42% translocated when 1% AMS was added to both formulations. In S. faberi, the largest portion of 14C-glyphosate translocated to tissues below the treated leaf. In summary, no differences were found between Ipa and Tms formulations in both weed species.",
