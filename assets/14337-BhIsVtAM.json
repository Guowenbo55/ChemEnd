            "Value": "AEROBIC: Thiocarbamates, such as cycloate, undergo rapid biodegradation(1,4). Cycloate was not mineralized in sewage or lakewater, but it was metabolized to organic products(2). When incorporated 3 inches deep into moist loam at a temperature of 70-80 \u00b0C, an 83% loss of cycloate occurred in 70 days; at 40 \u00b0C only 32% loss occurred(3). In dry soil incubated at 70-80 \u00b0C, only 9% loss occurred(3). Autoclaving the soils greatly increased the persistence of cycloate indicating that microbial degradation is important(3). Cycloate does not decrease the number or biochemical activity of soil organisms(4). Using a continuous flow-through system and soil inoculum, 14C-labeled cycloate was up to 90% mineralized(5). Laboratory metabolism study using aerobic soil resulted in a half-life of 43 days; soil degradates include the sulfoxide and N-ethylcyclohexylamine, N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylformamide and N-ethyl-N-formyl-S- ethyl thiocarbamate(6)."

If already flooded, then cycloate desorbs readily and then volatilizes. Koc values of 500-800 have been reported(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that cycloate is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Cycloate was found at a maximum depth of 6-9 inches in a leaching study using four different soils(5)."
