            "Value": "The effect of toxic doses of copper on blood constituents was studied in albino rats weighing approximately 100 grams. The copper exposed rats were given a sublethal dose of 0.1 grams per kilogram of copper sulfate by daily gavage for a total of 30 days. Copper poisoned rats were anemic, showing significant decreases in total red blood cells and hemoglobin as well as mean corpuscular volume and plasma corpuscular volume. Other effects associated with sublethal copper intake included increased blood bilirubin, cholesterol, and urea levels and increased enzyme activities for glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and GOT and GPT. Blood total protein and acid phosphatase activities were reduced by the copper treatment. Alkaline phosphatase, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and white blood cell count were not significantly affected by treatment."

            "Value": "Groups of 24 treated & 12 control male rats fed diet containing 2000 mg Cu/kg diet as copper sulfate (= to about 100 mg Cu/kg bw/day). Groups of 4 treated & 2 control rats killed after 1,2,3,6,9 & 15 wk & their liver & kidneys exam histologically. Inflammation & extensive necrosis of the liver & bile duct hyperplasia were evident by wk 6. By wk 15 there was considerable recovery, although some fibrosis & less marked hyperplasia of the bile duct could still be seen. Greenish discoloration of the kidneys was seen in some rats at wk 6. Microscopic effects (eosinophilic droplets in the cytoplasm of cells in the proximal convoluted tubules & desquamation of these cells into the lumen) first appeared at wk 3, & were more severe at 6 wk. Regeneration was almost complete at 15 wk. The investigators concluded that repeated copper dosing elicits a similar response in the kidneys & the liver, both organs adapting to the excess copper, resulting in the development of tolerance in the treated rats. Blood was taken from the rats prior to sacrifice & analyzed for enzyme activity. Alanine aminotransferase activity was significantly incr at wk 1 (indicative of liver damage), rose to a max around wk 6-9, & remained at that level to the end of the study. Ceruloplasm activity was elevated from wk 6 until the end of the study. Alkaline phosphatase activity & bilirubin levels were unaffected by copper treatment."
