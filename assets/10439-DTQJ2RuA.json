            "Value": "AEROBIC: An aerobic biological screening study, which utilized a 10 mg/l yeast extract and an Aeric Ochraqualf soil for inocula, indicated that 2-aminopyridine is not readily biodegradable(1). At 28 \u00b0C and a pH of 7, less than 1% of an initial 17 ppm of 2-aminopyridine was mineralized within 30 days as evidenced via the release of inorganic nitrogen(1). In addition, an acclimated aerobic soil grab sample study demonstrated slow biodegradation of 2-aminopyridine(2). 2-Aminopyridine was added to Fincastle silt loam (Aeric Ochraqualf) with a pH of 6.7 and incubated at 25 \u00b0C(2). Within 64 days, 59.5% of the available nitrogen was released to inorganic forms(2). Sterilized controls lost 14.9% of the starting material to volatilization; but, did not release inorganic nitrogen(2). A screening test, which utilized 5 ml garden soil suspensions with glucose, yeast extract and mineral salts, compared aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of 2-aminopyridine(3). 2-Aminopyridine completely degraded in greater than 96 days under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions(3). A 0% BOD was reported using 100 mg/l 2-aminopyridine in 30 mg/l sludge in 4 weeks(4)."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2-aminopyridine is expected to have very high mobility in soil. However, the pKa of 2-aminopyridine is 6.86(3), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts."
