It has a role as an environmental contaminant and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is a mancude organic heteromonocyclic parent, a monocyclic heteroarene, an azaarene and a member of pyridines.",

            "Value": "Results of biodegradability screening tests for pyridine using sewage or activated sludge inocula give mixed results ranging from rapid to no degradation(1-5,7). Although biodegradability is improved in longer tests employing a more vigorous inocula, sometimes the same test gives disparate results(1-4,7). Variations in the particular sewage or activated sludge inoculum would affect test results. One investigator obtained results ranging from 97% degradation in 6 days to no degradation in 30 days in 6 different standard tests(1). After a preincubation step was added to one test in which no degradation was observed in 19 days, degradability increased to 91%(3). However the closed bottle test which employs only a drop of sewage effluent as an inoculum, registered no degradation even with a preincubation step(1,3). Tests that were designed to simulate biological treatment plants resulted in complete and rapid removal of pyridine(1,9). In one test that employed a soil suspension as an inoculum, 100% degradation was obtained in 66-170 days(6). When this test was repeated under anaerobic conditions, degradation was more rapid(6). Complete degradation was obtained in 32-66 days(6). When 2 micromoles/g of pyridine was incubated with a silt loam soil, 11.7% remained after 4 days and none remained after 8 days(8). The biodegradation rate constant for pyridine in water was 0.0033 - 0.018 per hour which corresponds to half-lives of 39-210 hours(10)."

Disappearance of the pyridine added was measured by UV spectrophotometry, and the NH +4 released by cleavage of the pyridine ring was measured by colorimetry(1). Volatilization was estimated by analysis of the pyridines collected on the polyurethane foam stoppers used to plug the incubation vessels; sorption by soil was estimated from the initial decrease in solution concentration upon addition of soil(1). Pyridinecarboxylic acids, monohydroxypyridines and the unsubstituted pyridine ring did not volatilize and degraded within 7-24 days(1)."

Pyridine was completely degraded in about 8 days in a river die-away test, using Green River water, at low concentrations, but may cause toxicity problems for metabolizing organisms at higher concentrations(2). Organic bases present in coke-oven wastes have been found to be somewhat difficult to degrade, in particular, pyridine(3). However, with the addition of glucose or some other growth factor, these chemicals can be completely removed(3). Pyridine can be degraded by anaerobic methanogenic and sulfate reducing redox conditions as discovered in landfill leachate contaminated aquifers(4)."

Anaerobic sediment slurries collected from the Tsengwen River, Taiwan were shown to degrade pyridine at varying rates depending upon the salinity and whether the slurries were amended with sulfate, iron hydoxide or manganese oxide(2). In sulfate amended slurries, pyridine was only biodegraded from the oceanic (3.7% salinity) collection site and was not biodegraded in the freshwater slurries(2). Amendment of amorphous Fe(OH)3 or MnO2 in addition to sulfate greatly facilitated the biodegradation of pyridine from the sediment slurries collected from the freshwater sites, but not in the slurries collected in the oceanic sites(2). Pyridine was not biodegraded in anaerobic sediment and water slurries collected from the Tansui River, Taiwan over a 200 day incubation period(3)."

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed & histological exams were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hr or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline & pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these cmpds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological exam of the eyes showed similar effects for all 4 cmpds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, & cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, & pyridine had primary irritation index values of 5.8, 6.8, & 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a primary irritation index value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline & 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, & regeneration."

Oral dosing at 50 mg/kg in rats on a low protein diet resulted in an immediate cessation of growth & in most cases death within 2 wk. Fatty changes, vascular engorgement & hemorrhaging of liver were observed in some experiments. Methionine afforded some protection from pyridine toxicity. The max tolerated dose for rats injected sc, twice weekly for 4 wk, was found to be <180 mg/kg. Twice weekly injections of 100 mg/kg for 1 yr did not produce any changes in mortality relative to controls. Rabbits dosed orally for 5-7 days at 44 mg/kg showed no noticeable effects. In rats, five daily exposures to 3700 ppm pyridine for 40 min caused death, but one exposure to 1250 ppm for 7 hr did not. Repeated exposure (7 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to 10 or 50 ppm for 6 months caused increased liver weight/body weight ratios. Inhalation of pyridine has also been shown to produce emphysema, chronic bronchitis, & fatty degeneration of the liver & kidneys. Some other symptoms of pyridine intoxication include sialorrhea, weakness of limbs, occasional vomiting & diarrhea. By all routes of admin, acute exposure produces irritation & anesthesia & chronic exposure produces liver & kidney damage."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that pyridine is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of pyridine is 5.23(4), which indicates that pyridine will partially exist in the protonated form under acidic conditions and cations adsorb more strongly to soil surfaces than neutral molecules(SRC). The adsorption of pyridine to a basic subsoil (pH 8.15, 0.58% organic carbon) is negligible, while in an acidic subsoil (pH 4.85, O.24% organic carbon), the Freundlich adsorption constant was measured to be 5.78 and the slope 0.679(5). This suggests a cationic adsorption mechanism as pyridine is predominantly in its protonated form. Pyridine adsorbs to colloidal particles of sodium montmorillonite and kaolinite, a process which is attributed to cation exchange and is a function of pH(5). Adsorption is at a minimum at pH 1 and 11 and reaches a maximum at pH 4 for the montmorillonite and pH 5.5 for the kaolinite where the adsorption constants are 60 and 10, respectively(6)."
