A foliar fungicide used to control a wide range of Ascomycetes and Fungi Imperfecti in a wide range of crops. It has a role as an anthelminthic drug, a tubulin modulator, a microtubule-destabilising agent, an acaricide and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a carbamate ester, an aromatic amide, a benzimidazole fungicide and a benzimidazolylcarbamate fungicide.",

A proposed pathway for the bacterial degradation of benomyl proceeds by 2-aminobenzimidazole(1). Strains of Psuedomonas were isolated from soil and water that could grow on a mineral salts medium with benomyl as the sole carbon source(2). In another study, four strains of bacteria and 2 of fungi, which decomposed benomyl to non-fungistatic compounds, were isolated from loamy garden soil(3). Decomposition (16-34%) of 14C ring-labeled benomyl, during 6 and 12 months incubation periods, occurred only in nonsterilized soil. Ring cleavage of the benzimidazole nucleus and metabolism of this moiety to CO2 is apparently related to the presence of microorganisms(4)."

            "Value": "Biochemical studies on the mechanism of action of benzimidazole cmpds have shown that their biological effects are caused by interactions with cell microtubules. These cellular structures are present in all eukariotic cells & are involved in several vital functions, such as intracellular transports & cell division. Benzimidazole cmpds have been used as anticancer drugs & antihelminthic drugs in animals & humans because they act as spindle poisons by interfering with the formation &/or functioning of microtubules. However, eukaryotes are known to be unequally sensitive to each benzimidazole cmpd, which explains the use of these cmpds in helminthiases. Selective toxicity of benomyl & carbendazim for fungi has been explained by comparing their binding to fungal & mammalian tubulin. The different sensitivity of several fungi has also been explained by the different affinity of benomyl & carbendazim for fungal tubulin. Benomyl has been found to bind to fungal tubulin but not to porcine brain tubulin, indicating that mammalian tubulin has no, or at least low, affinity for benomyl. This is an agreement with the observation that benomyl at concns that are lethal for sensitive fungi does not interact with in vitro microtubule assembly in these brain extracts. In vitro ID50 values for several mycelial extracts of various fungal species sensitive to benomyl were all below 5 umol/liter. In vitro rat brain tubulin polymerization was inhibited to about 20% at benomyl or carbendazim concns of 25 umol/liter. For comparison, a standard antitubulin drug in humans such as vincristine inhibited 50% tubulin assembly at 0.1 umol/liter in the same experiment. The assembly of sheep & calf brain microtubule was also found to be unaffected by carbendazim concns higher than 100 umol/liter."

Lab and greenhouse experiments showed that benomyl and its two soil metabolites, methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) and 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB), were immobile in soils (organic matter ranged from 0.7 to 83.5 percent) and did not leach or move significantly from the site of application(2). The Koc of benomyl measured in soil is 2,000(3). According to a classification scheme(4), this Koc value suggests that benomyl is expected to have slight mobility in soil(SRC)."

The uptake and efflux from potato tuber tissue were studied and related to the in vivo translocation patterns. The patterns of translocation ranged from primarily apoplastic to ambimobile to symplastic. When the percentage of xenobiotic available for translocation was evaluated, there were major differences in patterns of translocation, primarily between plant genera. In barley, fenapanil, fenarimol, and oxamyl exhibited apoplastic transport, while all three were more ambimobile in soybean. Basipetal transport of oxamyl was 4.2% in barley compared to 30.8% in soybean. Basipetal translocation of benomyl remained very low at 3.0% and 4.1% in barley and soybean, respectively, while sucrose was about 60% in both species. Glyphosate and sucrose were translocated in a similar pattern. The transport of 2,4-D was primarily symplastic; however, retention in the tissue appeared to limit the rate of movement compared to sucrose. Uptake and efflux of fenapanil, fenarimol, and 2,4-D illustrated the possible role that cellular binding or partitioning may play in systemic translocation. In conjunction with the uptake and efflux, the octanol-water coefficients, log P, for fenarimol and fenapanil, 0.67 and -0.03, respectively, are correlated with the possible role of cellular binding or partitioning in the systemic movement of xenobiotics.",
