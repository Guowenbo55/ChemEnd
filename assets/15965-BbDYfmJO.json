    "Description": "Picloram is a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid that is pyridine-2-carboxylic acid which is substituted by a chloro group at positions 3,5 and 6, and by an amino group at position 4. It is a systemic herbicide used to control deeply rooted herbaceous weeds and woody plants in rights-of-way, forestry, range lands, pastures, and small grain crops. It has a role as a herbicide and a synthetic auxin. It is an aminopyridine, a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid, a chloropyridine and an organochlorine pesticide. It is functionally related to a picolinic acid.",

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Possible pathways for aerobic primary degradation of picloram are decarboxylation or amino displacement(1). Soil half-lives for picloram at various initial concentrations were 55 days at 0.25 ppm (7 days lag-phase), 90 days at 0.5 ppm (30 days lag phase), and 180 days at 1.0 ppm (90 days lag phase)(2). Picloram was degraded through aerobic metabolism in seven soils, half-lives ranging from 167 to 513 days, with carbon dioxide being the major degradate(3). Aerobic degradation half-lives for picloram at various application rates were 18 days at 0.0025 ppm, 29 days at 0.025 ppm, 150 days at 0.25 ppm, and 300 days at 2.5 ppm(4). After 100 days incubation in 3 soil types, remaining picloram concentrations were 63 to 77% of the initial concentrations(5). Degradation of 75 to 100% picloram in soils required 18 months(6). No detectable degradation of picloram was observed in 8 weeks in soil with high organic matter content from Pentego, NC(7). In the presence of a mixture containing 0.5% fertile garden soil, yeast, and other organics, picloram persisted >275 days(8). In a 423 day period using a picloram concentration of 0.4 ppm, some soils had 52 to 82.5% of the picloram decomposed and others had only 5.2 and 7.6% decomposed(9). Degradation of picloram in thirteen soils after incubation for 6 months ranged from 0 to 60% at 3 mg/L, from 0 to 84% at 1.5 mg/L, from 5 to 94% at 0.75 mg/L, from 28 to 99% at 0.375 mg/L, from 38 to >99% at 0.188 mg/L, from 32 to >99% at 0.094 mg/L, from 28 to >99% at 0.047 mg/L(10). Most of the soils showed a tendency towards greater percentage detoxification for lower concentrations(10). Picloram was applied at a rate of 10 ppm to five different soils, after 124 days of alternating wet and drying cycles, picloram remained in the soil 82.7 to 91.0% incubated at 30 \u00b0C and 86.0 to 93.0% incubated at 50 \u00b0C(11). The amount of non-degraded picloram in groundwater from 4 sites after incubation for 15 weeks (105 days) was 60.8 to 82.4% (average 71.6%) at an initial concentration of 0.72 ppm, and 60.7 to 79.8% (average 67.9%) at an initial concentration of 10.0 ppm(12)."

The addition of alternate electron acceptors, such as sulfate, inhibited the dehalogenation of picloram(1).

In surviving dams, doses up to and including 1000 mg/kg/day affected neither maternal weight gains, litter size and resorption rate nor other reproductive parameters examined. Evidence of retarded fetal growth, as reflected by an increase in unossified 5th sternebrae, was observed in the treated groups. In the postnatal study, survival and development of pups was unaffected by treatment of the dams with picloram. Oral administration of subtoxic and even of maternally toxic doses of picloram during organogenesis produces neither teratogenesis nor adverse effects on neonatal development in the Sprague-Dawley rat."

Silky crazyweed compared to woolly loco was more than 10 times as sensitive to increasing rates of either herbicide. The two species absorbed 8 to 15%, and 11 to 17% of applied picloram and metsulfuron, respectively. Translocation of picloram and metsulfuron out of treated leaflets of either species was less than 3% of that absorbed after 96 h. Approximately 70 and 100% of the absorbed herbicides remained as picloram and metsulfuron, respectively, in both species. Therefore, differences in picloram or metsulfuron uptake, translocation, and metabolism appear inadequate to account for the differential response to each herbicide by the two locoweed species.

Oats and soybeans had similar absorption patterns of rapid initial uptake. However, total accumulation patterns markedly differed in that accumulation was concentration-dependent for oats but not for soybeans. Initial uptake by oats and soybean roots increased as solution concentration increased. Picloram was redistributed in oats and soybeans and some egress from roots to solution occurred. Picloram uptake by both plant species was markedly diminished with an increase in pH from 3.5 to 4.5, but pH had little effect from 4.5 to 9.5. Less picloram was taken up by oats and soybean roots from solution maintained at 4 C than at 26 C. Translocation to tops followed a similar trend. Increasing concentrations of three metabolic inhibitors, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), sodium azide, and sodium arsenite, reduced root uptake of picloram in both species. All inhibitors (except DNP for oats) at 10\u22126 to 10\u22125 molar concentrations stimulated translocation of picloram to oats and soybean tops while higher concentrations depressed translocation.",

Within 24 h, more than 97% of the radioactivity from picloram or clopyralid was absorbed by the foliage of both plant species. Acropetal transport of both herbicides was similar in the two plant species, with approximately 60% or more of the recovered radioactivity from picloram and clopyralid treatments moving acropetally out of the treated leaf 144 h after application. Less than 6% of the 14C-label from either herbicide treatment moved basipetally in both species. Therefore, differences in absorption and translocation did not account for intra- or inter-species sensitivity differences to the two herbicides. Significantly more 14C-picloram and 14C-clopyralid was converted to water-soluble metabolites in rapeseed than in sunflower plants. However, in rapeseed plants, the pattern of metabolism of both herbicides was similar, indicating that the difference between the metabolism of picloram and clopyralid did not account for the sensitivity difference within this species. It appears that only one picloram and clopyralid metabolite was formed in both plant species as determined by TLC. The metabolite of picloram or clopyralid was a water-soluble conjugate that yielded the carboxylic acid amide of the respective herbicide upon ammonolysis.\n",

Absorption decreased with increasing pH of the picloram solution, indicating that picloram diffused through the cuticle as the undissociated molecule. Picloram entered detached pads at the areoles more readily than through the surrounding cuticle. In the glasshouse, whole plants consisting of an old, mature pad supporting a young, growing pad absorbed picloram very slowly whether picloam was applied as a spray to old or young pads or to the soil. About 90 and 80% of the applied picloram remained on the waxy surface of old and new pads, respectively, and about 2% of the applied picloram was recovered from within the epicuticular wax after 30 days. Picloram concentrations within pads treated in the glasshouse were greater when the herbicide was applied to new pads (4.6 \u03bcg/g) than old pads (1.9 \u03bcg/g) after 30 days. More picloram was translocated basipetally from treated new pads to untreated old pads than in the opposite direction, but concentrations in untreated pads were low (<1 \u03bcg/g). Little picloram was absorbed by roots, compared to pads, and little was translocated into or out of roots. These results conflict with the view that the effectiveness of picloram for pricklypear control is attributable to extensive root uptake and acropetal transport. However, observations of plants 6 months after treatment indicated that soil applications were more effective than sprays in the glasshouse.",
