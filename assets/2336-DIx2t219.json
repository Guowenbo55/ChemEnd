            "Value": "AEROBIC: (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene was not significantly mineralized in sludge treated Caledon soil; half-lives ranged from 23 to 266 weeks(1). The persistence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil is expected to vary depending upon the nature of compounds accompanying it and the nature and previous history of the soil(1). After 5 days incubation in activated sludge, <0.1% of the applied (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene concentration was degraded to (14)-CO2(2). Incubation of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in creosote-pentachlorophenol contaminated soil over 285 days led to a small, <1%, mineralization of benzo(a)pyrene(3). Calculated half-lives for the mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in sediment/water microcosms ranged from >200 weeks in Redfish Bay, TX to >300 weeks in Lake Chicot, AR; no mineralization was detected in microcosms containing sediment and water from DeGray Reservoir, AR(4). The extent of mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene, at a concentration of 105 ng/g, in soils collected from an abandoned coal tar refinery was very low, <8%, after 160 days(5). The level of indigenous mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in soils obtained from three abandoned coal gasification plants as measured by serum bottle respirometry ranged from not detectable to 25% following incubations >180 days; (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene mineralization occurred after a 28-day lag period(6). In soils from Alert (contaminated with Arctic diesel fuel), Saglek (from a radar installation), Varta (from a former gasworks site), and Westbrook (not known to be polluted), the percent removal of benzo(a)pyrene (10 ug/mL concentration) from enrichment cultures after 90 days incubation under aerobic conditions were, respectively: at 20 \u00b0C, 68, 76, 60, and 27; at 7 \u00b0C, 33, 31, 34 and 37(7).

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a 240 day soil microcosm study, half-lives of 530, 290, and 220 days at 10, 20, and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, were estimated for benzo(a)pyrene(1). In a pilot biotreatability study, benzo(a)pyrene was reduced 99.9% by a sequencing batch reactor(2). In soil-water slurry systems, with actual town gas soil, benzo(a)pyrene was biodegraded approximately 22% after 5 weeks incubation using a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-acclimated mixed culture(3). In bench-scale biotreatability studies using a solid-phase bioremediation process (landfarming chambers containing sediment and soil collected from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL), the benzo(a)pyrene concentration was reduced from 84.3 to 63.6 in unamended surface soil; 84.3 to 47.7 in nutrient-amended surface soil; 246.6 to 183.6 in unamended sediment; and 246.6 to 178.8 mg/L and farming chamber in nutrient-amended sediment following 12 weeks incubation(4). In shake flask studies, an initial benzo(a)pyrene concentration of 2.1 ug/mL was reduced to 0.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater inoculated with indigenous soil microorganisms from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL(5). After 60 days of batch slurry bioremediation, the initial solid-phase benzo(a)pyrene concn of 56 ug/g was reduced to 25.2 ug/g, a 55% removal(6). In a soil column study containing sandy soil samples from a site contaminated with creosote, an initial benzo(a)pyrene concentration of approximately 120 mg/kg was reduced to about 100 mg/kg following 170 days incubation(7). Half-lives derived for benzo(a)pyrene in four soils amended with sewage sludge ranged from 120 to 270 days, with a mean half-life of 211 days(8). 64% benzo(a)pyrene removal over 36 days in an activated sludge pilot reactor was attributed to biodegradation(9). No significant degradation of benzo(a)pyrene was observed in soil obtained from a former tar-oil refinery following 8 weeks of incubation in a percolator(10). In soil classified as an Orthic Luvisol (>70% silt, >20% clay), benzo(a)pyrene declined from the applied 10.8 to 4.3 mg/kg in 27.5 months; the soil half-life was determined to be 2.7 years(11). Mean estimated half-lives for sludge applied benzo(a)pyrene to Lee Valley and Luddington, UK soils were 3.2 and 8.2 years, respectively; biodegradation is suspected to be the most important loss process in these soils(12). Biodegradation rates of benzo(a)pyrene in Boston Harbor sediments ranged from 0.15 to 49.5 ng/g-hr; these values correspond to turnover rates of 53.7 to 82.3 days(13). Biodegradation half-lives of 309 and 229 days were observed for benzo(a)pyrene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(14)."

To provide direct evidence for NFAT3 in the environmental carcinogen-caused carcinogenic effect, (+/-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE), an ultimate environmental carcinogen metabolized from benzo[a]pyrene, was utilized. /Investigators/ found that exposure of Cl41 cells to B[a]PDE was able to induce cell transformation in Cl41 cells, while specific knock-down of NFAT3 resulted in the dramatic inhibition of this cell transformation. The tumorigenicity of B[a]PDE-caused transformed cells was confirmed in nude mice, whereas the tumor formation of B[a]PDE-treated NFAT3 small interference RNA (siRNA) knock-down cells was significantly reduced. Further studies showed that the role of NFAT3 in B[a]PDE-caused cell transformation was mediated by up-regulation of its downstream targeted gene TNF. This conclusion was based on the findings that inhibition of NFAT3 activation by either FK506 or NFAT3 siRNA dramatically down-regulated the TNF induction upon B[a]PDE exposure, and that knock-down of TNF by its specific siRNA also led to abrogation of B[a]PDE-induced cell transformation in Cl41 cells and their tumorigenicity in nude mice. Collectively, these results provide direct evidence for the important role of NFAT3 activation in B[a]PDE-induced cell transformation by up-regulation of TNF expression in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells, further suggesting that B[a]PDE may exert its tumor promotion effect on skin carcinogenesis, at least partially, by inducing TNF expression."

Exposure of p53-null H1299 human lung cancer cells to BPDE resulted in S and G(2) phase cell cycle arrest, but not mitotic block, which correlated with induction of cyclin B1 protein expression, down-modulation of cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C) and Cdc25B protein levels, and hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C (S216), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1; Y15), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1; S317 and S345) and Chk2 (T68). The BPDE-induced S phase block, but not the G(2)/M phase arrest, was significantly attenuated by knockdown of Chk1 protein level. The BPDE-mediated accumulation of sub-diploid fraction (apoptotic cells) was significantly decreased in H1299 cells transiently transfected with both Chk1 and Chk2 specific siRNAs. The H460 human lung cancer cell line (wild-type p53) was relatively more sensitive to BPDE-mediated growth inhibition and enrichment of sub-diploid apoptotic fraction compared with H1299 cells. The BPDE exposure failed to activate either S or G(2) phase checkpoint in H460 cells. Instead, the BPDE-treated H460 cells exhibited a nearly 8-fold increase in sub-diploid apoptotic cells that was accompanied by phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites. Knockdown of p53 protein level in H460 cells attenuated BPDE-induced apoptosis but enforced activation of S and G(2) phase checkpoints. In conclusion, the present study points towards an important role of p53 in regulation of cellular responses to BPDE in human lung cancer cells. /Anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)/"

            "Value": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, which may contribute to the development of human cancer. The ultimate carcinogenic BaP metabolite produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, anti-BaP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide, binds covalently to DNA and causes mutations. The levels of various CYP isoforms can be significantly modulated under inflammatory conditions. As the chronic inflammation is known to contribute to carcinogenesis, we investigated interactions of a major proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and BaP in regulation of the expression of CYP1A1/1B1 and induction of DNA damage in rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells. TNF-alpha enhanced induction of CYP1B1, while it simultaneously suppressed the BaP-induced CYP1A1 expression. The observed deregulation of CYP1 induction was found to be associated with a significantly enhanced formation of DNA adducts. The elevated DNA damage corresponded with increased phosphorylation of p53 tumor suppressor at Ser-15 residue, enhanced accumulation of cells in the S-phase of cell cycle and potentiation of BaP-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CYP1B1 by fluoranthene significantly decreased both the formation of DNA adducts and the induction of apoptosis in WB-F344 cells treated with BaP and TNF-alpha, thus suggesting that this isoform might be responsible for genotoxic effects of BaP in nonparenchymal liver cells. Our results seem to indicate that inflammatory conditions might enhance genotoxic effects of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through upregulation of CYP1B1 expression."

Also, the catalytic activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was induced whereas that of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was not by the addition of BaP. BaP also induced the mitochondrial dysfunction, including transition of mitochondria membrane potential and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Furthermore, a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 to Bax ratio and phosphorylation of p53(Ser 15) were observed in BaP-treated cells.

In contrast to the hepatoma HepG2 cells, cytochrome P450 isoforms and Ah-receptor are not expressed in the hepatoma 27 cells. The transcription factor NF-kappaB was activated only in the hepatoma 27 cells by BP treatment but not by its noncarcinogenic isomer benzo[e]pyrene (BeP). Conversely to NF-kappaB activation the transcription factor AP-1 was activated in the hepatoma HepG2 cells by cell treatment with BP but not in the hepatoma 27 cells. It is concluded that the NF-kappaB activation is caused by nonmetabolized BP molecule and not related to activation of the Ah-receptor. The transcription factor AP-1 seems to be activated as a result of the interaction of BP with the Ah-receptor."

Paradoxically, however, Cyp1a1-/- knockout mice are more sensitive to oral benzo[a]pyrene exposure, compared with wild-type Cyp1a1+/+ mice ... To further investigate the mechanism for this enhanced sensitivity, Cyp1a1-/-, Cyp1a2-/-, and Cyp1b1-/- single-knockout, Cyp1a1/1b1-/- and Cyp1a2/1b1-/- double-knockout, and Cyp1+/+ wild-type mice were analyzed. After administration of oral benzo[a]pyrene (125 mg/kg/day) for 18 days, Cyp1a1-/- mice showed marked wasting, immunosuppression, and bone marrow hypocellularity, whereas the other five genotypes did not. After 5 days of feeding, steady-state blood levels of benzo[a]pyrene were approximately 25 and approximately 75 times higher in Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice, respectively, than in wild-type mice. Benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct levels were highest in liver, spleen, and marrow of Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice. Many lines of convergent data obtained with oral benzo[a]pyrene dosing suggest that: 1) inducible CYP1A1, probably in both intestine and liver, is most important in detoxication; 2) CYP1B1 in spleen and marrow is responsible for metabolic activation of benzo[a]pyrene, which results in immune damage in the absence of CYP1A1; 3) both thymus atrophy and hepatocyte hypertrophy are independent of CYP1B1 metabolism but rather may reflect long-term activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor; and 4) the magnitude of immune damage in Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a1/1b1-/- mice is independent of plasma benzo[a]pyrene and total-body burden and clearance. Thus, a balance between tissue-specific expression of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes governs sensitivity of benzo[a]pyrene toxicity and, possibly, carcinogenicity."

            "Value": "Benzo[a]pyrene is metabolically activated to a series of reactive intermediates by CYP450 and related enzymes under control of the arylhydrocarbon receptor. There is strong evidence that the benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide mechanism operates in mouse-lung tumorigenesis, while there is also strong evidence that both the radical-cation and the diolepoxide mechanisms are involved in mouse-skin carcinogenesis. The meso-region mechanism has been studied only in rat liver, while the mechanism that involves the formation of ortho-quinone/reactive oxygen species has only been studied in vitro, although reactive oxygen species can be formed in vivo by other benzo[a]pyrene-mediated mechanisms. All these pathways reflect genotoxic mechanisms, as they involve alterations to DNA. Benzo[a]pyrene is pleotropic and has the ability to affect many cell- and organ-based systems. Therefore, there are probably many modes of carcinogenic action operating to different extents in vivo. These include mechanisms that involve AhR, oxidative stress, immunotoxicity and epigenetic events. Based on the best available, consistent and strong experimental and human mechanistic evidence it is concluded that benzo[a]pyrene contributes to the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects resulting from occupational exposure to complex PAH mixtures that contain benzo[a] pyrene. The most commonly encountered - and most widely studied - mechanistically relevant DNA lesion is the anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol- 9,10-oxide-DNA adduct. The formation of this adduct is consistent with anti-benzo[a]pyrene- 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-associated genotoxic effects in surrogate tissues and with the mutation pattern in the TP53 gene in lung tumors from humans exposed to PAH mixtures that contain benzo[a]pyrene. The fact that those PAH mixtures and benzo[a]pyrene itself induce genotoxic effects like sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, DNA damage (comet assay) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, supports the notion that benzo[a]pyrene contributes to human cancer."

            "Value": "Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) is a genetic element that mobilizes throughout the mammalian genome via retrotransposition and damages host DNA via mutational insertions, chromosomal rearrangements, and reprogramming of gene expression. The cellular mechanisms responsible for aberrant L1 expression during cancer pathogenesis are unclear. Previously, we have shown that L1 reactivation in several human cell lines is dependent upon the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor member of the PAS superfamily of proteins. We also showed that ectopic expression of L1 reprograms the HepG2 genome leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we present evidence that reactivation of L1 and modulation of EMT in HepG2 cells by the AhR ligand benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is effected through the canonical TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. BaP increased TGF-beta1 mRNA, SMAD2 phosphorylation and decreased expression of E-Cadherin. The functional relevance of these interactions and the involvement of TGFBR1/ALK5 and SMAD2/3 were confirmed by siRNA interference. Furthermore, expression of L1-encoded ORF1p was positively correlated with the activation of TGF-beta1 signaling in human hepatocarcinoma samples at various stages of malignant progression. These results indicate that ligand-mediated AhR activation regulates L1 via canonical TGF-beta1 signaling and raise important questions about the molecular etiology of human hepatocarcinomas."

This abnormal situation induces changes in the cell cycle, DNA damage, chromosomal and mitotic aberrations, all of which may be related to carcinogenesis. In order to further investigate the mechanistic basis of these effects, HepG2 cells were treated with 3uM B[a]P for various time periods, followed by further incubation in the absence of B[a]P for up to 192 hr. B[a]P treatment led initially to S-phase arrest followed by recovery and subsequent induction of G2/M arrest, indicating activation of the corresponding DNA damage checkpoints. Immunofluorescence-based studies revealed accumulation of B[a]P-induced DNA adducts and chromosomal damage which persisted beyond mitosis and entry into a new cycle, thus giving rise to a new round of activation of the S-phase checkpoint. Prolonged further cultivation of the cells in the absence of B[a]P resulted in high frequencies of various abnormal mitotic events. Abrogation of the B[a]P-induced S-phase arrest by the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 triggered a strong apoptotic response but also dramatically decreased the frequency of mitotic abnormalities in the surviving cells, suggesting that events occurring during S-phase arrest contribute to the formation of delayed mitotic damage. Overall, our data demonstrate that, although S-phase arrest serves as a mechanism by which the cells reduce their load of genetic damage, its prolonged activation may also have a negative impact on the balance between cell death and heritable genetic damage."
