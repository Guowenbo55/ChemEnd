            "Value": "AEROBIC: The biodegradation half-life of 4-chlorophenol in Oklahoma sand collected from an aerobic aquifer ranged from 1.5 to 15 days(1). The suggested half-lives of 4-chlorophenol in air, water, soil and sediment are 55, 55, 550 and 1700 hours, respectively(2). 4-Chlorophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 2% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(3). In an aerobic screening test, the microorganism Pseudomonas gladioli was able to degrade 4-chlorophenol 100% after an incubation period of 24 hours and an initial concn of 2.96 ug/mL(4). 4-Chlorophenol was 100% degraded by a microbial mixture inoculum after an incubation time of 96 hours(5). 4-Chlorophenol was 100% degraded in a cyclone fermentor after 150 hours and a lag time of 25 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 88 hours(6). The max removal rate of 4-chlorophenol (200 mg/L TOC) in activated sludge was 40 mg TOC/g initial microbial solids during a semi-continuous activated sludge test. The mean of biomass retention time (MBRT) was approx 5 days(7). Aerobic batch mixed cultures degraded 4-chlorophenol via meta-cleavage. Incubation at 30 \u00b0C resulted in the complete removal of 4-chlorophenol within 48 hours. Stoichiometric release of chlorine was achieved after 100 hours. Degradation led to an accumulation of 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, the meta-cleavage product of 4-chlorocatechol(8). A mix culture from acclimated, activated sludge obtained from municipal wastewater treatment degraded a mixture of phenols (10 mg/L each of phenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) more efficiently than pure cultures after 70 day acclimation periods at 15 \u00b0C. The mixed cultures degraded the phenols in <24 hours while the pure cultures degraded the phenols in >9 days(9). Aerobic biodegradation of chlorophenols occurs by hydroxylation to chlorocatechols and by spontaneous dechlorination after ortho-cleavage(10), although meta-cleavage is possible with 4-chlorophenol(8)."

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: All chlorophenols undergo anaerobic degradation under a variety of microbial conditions. Degradation normally occurs by reductive dechlorination followed by ring cleavage(1). An anaerobic gas production test of sewage sludge, a freshwater swamp sediment and a marine sediment was conducted. Results revealed 0 to 30% mineralization of 4-chlorophenol in digested sewage sludge after an incubation period of 56 days, while 4-chlorophenol inhibited gas production in freshwater swamp and marine sediment(2). The anaerobic degradation potential of 4-chlorophenol in primary digesting sludge, expressed as net gas potential (NPG) was determined to be -40, which corresponds to a chemical which inhibits biodegradation(3). The rate of 4-chlorophenol transformation in anaerobic estuarine sediment was determined to be 0.059/day, which corresponds to a half-life of 11.7 days(4). The anaerobic degradation of 4-chlorophenol in a cyclone fermentor system revealed 0% remaining after 100 hours and a lag time of 51 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 84 hours(5). 4-Chlorophenol biodegrades in the absence of oxygen under methanogenic, sulfidogenic, and iron-reducing conditions(6). In anaerobic sediment enrichments, 4-chlorophenol was depleted by microorganisms under iron-reducing conditions. Concns of 100 uM were depleted within 90 days and concns of 500 uM and 700 uM were depleted in < 150 days. The results indicate that iron (III) can serve as an electron donor for dechlorination in absence of oxygen(7). 4-Chlorophenol was the most persistent of the chlorophenols in methanogenic river sediments. All chlorophenols were mineralized to methane under the methanogenic conditions after 33 weeks with a depletion rate of 2.80 umole/L-day. An initial lag period of 22-23.7 weeks was reported(8). The half-life of 4-chlorophenol in anaerobic lake sediment (<1% organic matter) was reported as 346 days with a 31 day lag period(9). 4-Chlorophenol (100 ug/L) was persistent in anaerobic sand and gravel after 3 weeks in a model ecosystem consisting of a laboratory filter operating with anaerobic groundwater(10). Incubation of 4-chlorophenol with sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions gave the following results: approximately 61% disappearance of 4-chlorophenol in 6 weeks with an approximately 3 week lag period using unacclimated sludge; approximately 100% loss of 4-chlorophenol in 3, 14, or 8 days using sludge acclimated to 2-, 3- or 4-chlorophenol, respectively; in (14)C-labeled-4-chlorophenol experiments using sludge acclimated to 2- or 4- chlorophenol, >90% of total (14)C added was recovered as (14)CH4 and (14)CO2(11)."

The experiment exposed willow trees to varying concentrations of 4-CP in a hydroponic setting. At concentrations below 15 mg/L, minimal impact on transpiration was observed, indicating low toxicity. However, at higher concentrations (37.3 mg/L and above), transpiration decreased significantly, causing wilting and eventual death at 79.9 mg/L. Interestingly, higher concentrations showed greater 4-CP retention within the system, especially at 79.9 mg/L. In experiments involving trees, there was a substantial removal of 4-CP from the system, up to 99.5%, whereas in treeless systems, only 6% to 10% was removed. This highlighted the crucial role of tree roots in degrading 4-CP, primarily in the root zone. The study suggested that phytoremediation using willow trees could be a promising approach, especially at concentrations below 37.3 mg/L, where 4-CP degradation was rapid and effective without causing lethal effects on the trees.",
