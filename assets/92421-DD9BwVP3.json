    "Description": "Trinexapac-ethyl is an ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of trinexapac with ethanol. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a plant growth regulator, an agrochemical, a pro-agent and a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a member of cyclohexanones, a beta-hydroxy ketone, an enol, an ethyl ester and a member of cyclopropanes. It is functionally related to a trinexapac.",

            "content": "Trinexapac-ethyl (TriEt) is a systemic growth regulator belonging to the acylcyclohexanedione class, known for its ability to influence plant growth in graminaceous species like grasses. Its systemic action hinges on its absorption by plant tissues and subsequent transformation from its ester form to the biologically active acid form (trinexapac acid or TriH), which requires enzymatic hydrolysis. Once converted, TriH is transported within the plant, primarily moving acropetally toward the shoot apex. This systemic translocation allows TriH to impact actively growing meristematic regions, influencing growth processes. However, this systemic behavior introduces a delay in its onset of action compared to locally acting growth regulators. Additionally, the systemic nature of TriEt can lead to its dilution within larger plants, potentially affecting its overall efficacy. Understanding TriEt's systemic behavior is crucial for effective application and optimizing its growth-regulating effects in various plant species and environmental conditions.(Rademacher, W. (2014).
