This study investigated the uptake of soil-applied dinotefuran and three major metabolites by lettuce and celery from previous season's applications and analyzed their residues in soil and consumable parts. Dinotefuran was applied to soil at intervals of 30 and 60 days before planting. Residue levels of dinotefuran and its metabolites in mature lettuce leaves and celery shoots, as well as soil samples at various stages, were estimated. The uptake of dinotefuran by lettuce and celery ranged between 23.8% and 28% and between 51.73% and 53.06%, respectively. The half-lives of dinotefuran in lettuce soil ranged from 1.33 to 1.54 days for PBI-30 and 0.91 to 2.16 days for PBI-60, while in celery soil, they ranged from 0.9 to 1.47 days for PBI-30 and 0.79 to 1.65 days for PBI-60. Residues were below Korean MRLs in most samples, indicating negligible risk. The study recommends planting the next crop at least 60 days after harvesting the first crop to minimize pesticide residue risks.",

Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow.
