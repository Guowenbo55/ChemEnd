The study focused on two organic bases (fenpropimorph and imazalil) and four organic acids (bentazone, primisulfuron-methyl, rimsulfuron, and triasulfuron), covering a wide range of log Kow and pKa values. Measurements were taken at different pH levels in the external solution. Results showed that translocation of weak bases was higher at low pH, with transpiration stream concentration factors (TSCF) ranging from 0.31 to 0.95. For weak acids, TSCF values varied from 0.55 to 1.50 for primisulfuron-methyl, 0.64 to 1.35 for rimsulfuron, 0.81 to 0.93 for triasulfuron, and 0.69 to 0.92 for bentazone. The study suggested that de-topped soybean plants in the pressure chamber were unable to regulate their xylem sap pH, leading to smaller variations in TSCF compared to intact plants. This lack of pH regulation affected the ion-trap process responsible for the accumulation or exclusion of weak electrolytes in the xylem of living plants.",
