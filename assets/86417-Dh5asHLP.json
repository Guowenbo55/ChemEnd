    "Description": "Fluquinconazole is a member of the class of quinazolines that is 6-fluoroquinazolin-4-one carrying additional 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl and 2,4-dichlorophenyl substituents at positions 2 and 3 respectively. A fungicide used to control Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Basidiomycetes spp. on cereals, beets and fruit. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of quinazolines, a dichlorobenzene, a member of triazoles, an organofluorine compound, a conazole fungicide and a triazole fungicide.",

            "content": "Translocation of 14C-labeled fluquinconazole was studied in seedling wheat leaves, both uninfected and infected with Mycosphaerella graminicola, using combustion analysis and radio thin-layer chromatographic analysis. Fluquinconazole was found to translocate acropetally but not basipetally, accumulating around infection sites within 6 days after treatment. This accumulation occurred before M. graminicola hyphae had spread beyond one host cell around the invasion site, suggesting a host response to infection. Inoculated leaves showed increased rates of transpiration and stomatal conductance but decreased net photosynthesis, indicating a complex response to infection and fungicide treatment. The exact mechanism of fungicide accumulation was not determined.",
