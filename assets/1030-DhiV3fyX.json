    "Description": "Propane-1,2-diol is the simplest member of the class of propane-1,2-diols, consisting of propane in which a hydrogen at position 1 and a hydrogen at position 2 are substituted by hydroxy groups. A colourless, viscous, hygroscopic, low-melting (-59??) and high-boiling (188??) liquid with low toxicity, it is used as a solvent, emulsifying agent, and antifreeze. It has a role as a protic solvent, an allergen, a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a member of propane-1,2-diols and a glycol.",

Degradation occurred with propylene glycol alone and in combination with ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol at glycol concentrations ranging from 392 to 5278 mg/kg suggesting that high levels of glycols in deicing fluids are unlikely to inhibit biodegradation. Complete disappearance of 0.045% propylene glycol occurred after 12 days at 8 \u00b0C and 57% of the theoretical oxygen demand was recovered after 34 days. With 0.45% propylene glycol, 76% degradation and 44% mineralization was obtained after 111 days(1). The rate of biodegradation ranged from 11.4 to 41.4 mg/kg soil per day at 8 \u00b0C with an average of 22.7 mg/kg per day.
