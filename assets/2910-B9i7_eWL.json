A thiazide diuretic, it has been used in the management of hypertension and oedema. It has a role as a diuretic and an antihypertensive agent.",

They increase the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and increase in aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, thus increasing the loss of potassium and hydrogen ions. /Thiazide diuretics/"
