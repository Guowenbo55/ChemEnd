    "Description": "Tolfenpyrad is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-chloro-3-ethyl-1-methylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 1-[4-(4-methylphenoxy)phenyl]methylamine. It has a role as a mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone reductase inhibitor, an agrochemical, an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agent. It is a pyrazole insecticide, an aromatic amide, an aromatic ether and an organochlorine compound.",

Citrus peel consistently exhibited higher residue levels compared to other matrices, ranging from 0.051\u20130.40 mg/kg for novaluron, 0.063\u20130.37 mg/kg for pyriproxyfen, 0.24\u20131.0 mg/kg for thiacloprid, and 0.36\u20133.6 mg/kg for tolfenpyrad. In contrast, citrus pulp had the lowest residue levels, and the pesticides could be categorized into two groups based on their values. Pyriproxyfen and thiacloprid residues in citrus pulp were consistently below the limits of quantification (LOQs) at three sampling intervals of 14, 21, and 28 days. However, both novaluron and tolfenpyrad were detected in citrus pulp, albeit at lower concentrations of 0.01\u20130.063 mg/kg and 0.01\u20130.039 mg/kg, respectively. These findings confirm that pyriproxyfen and thiacloprid are non-systemic pesticides, as they did not translocate significantly into the citrus pulp. Conversely, novaluron and tolfenpyrad were detected in the pulp, indicating their systemic nature. The residue levels of these pesticides in citrus samples at 14, 21, and 28 days after spraying ranged between 0.018\u20130.12 mg/kg for novaluron, 0.013\u20130.076 mg/kg for pyriproxyfen, 0.027\u20130.19 mg/kg for thiacloprid, and 0.075\u20130.64 mg/kg for tolfenpyrad.",
