When the concn equivalent of 3 kg/ha of ametryne was incubated in a clay-lime soil, 2.8% and 8.6% of the herbicide degraded to CO2 in 51 and 110 days, respectively(2). In another experiment, 10-50% degradation in 10 days occurred in one of four soils, while degradation was either absent or uncertain in the other three soils(3). In a 25-day experiment, CO2 evolution occurred from ametryne-treated sterile soil that had been inoculated with an extract from ametryne enriched soil, but not from uninoculated controls(1). After 60 days incubation, 8.7% and 63.7% of the applied ametryne remained in inoculated Hilo silty clay loam and Molakai silty clay, two Hawaiian soils that are typically used in the cultivation of sugarcane(4). The inoculum was prepared by leaching Molakai soil with ametryne solutions(4). Biodegradation initially involved N-dealkylation. Less than 0.2% of the ametryne degraded to CO2 in this period(4). No significant degradation occurred in autoclaved controls(4)."

            "Value": "Triazine herbicides, such as ametryne, are weak bases and can be protonated to form cationic species depending on the herbicide pKa and soil pH(1). The pKa of ametryne is 4.10(2), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(3). Maximum adsorption of ametryne to Na-montmorillonite occurred at a pH level in the vicinity of this chemicals pKa(4). Ametryne has been assigned pesticide leaching potentials of 50 and 46 for soil and foliar application, respectively; a value of 0 indicates no leaching potential, while a value of 100 indicates maximum leaching potential(5). Seventy days posttreatment, ametryne applied at 2, 4, and 8 lb/acre leached to <1, 1-3, and 3-5 inches below the soil surface(6). In 4 Puerto Rican soils, ametryne applied at 4 lb/acre did not penetrate very deeply into the soil under the influence of 1-4 inches of simulated rainfall(7). In the lightest textured soil, it penetrated to between 1 and 2 inches, whereas in the other three soil it leached less than 1 inch below the soil surface(7). The partition coefficient of ametryne to Na-, Ca-, and Mg-montmorillonite was 22, 59, and 24 ug/g with the adsorption decreasing markedly as the pH was increased from 5 to 8(8). The absorption of ametryne to a clay loam decreases by approximately a factor of two when the pH was increased from 4 to 8(9). Ametryne has been included in class 3 on a soil mobility scale of 1 (immobile) to 5 (very mobile)(10). The Freundlich adsorption constants, K and 1/n, in Hilo silty clay loam and Molakai silty clay, two Hawaiian soils that are typically used in the cultivation of sugar cane, a crop for which ametryne is used, are 5.94 and 0.75 (Hilo) and 1.83 and 0.74 (Molakai), respectively(11)."
