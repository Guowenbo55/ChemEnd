The concentration of coproporphyrin-3 was determined as an indicator porphyrin metabolism. Compounds having the most hematoxic effect were aniline; meta-chloroaniline; para-chloroaniline; meta-nitroaniline; para-nitroaniline; aminotoluenes; and nitrochlorobenzenes. Least hemotoxic were isomer nitrotoluenes, o-chloro-p-nitroaniline, and isomer nitrochlorobenzenes. Intoxication with aniline, nitrobenzene, p-chloroaniline, m-chloroaniline, and isomer nitrochlorobenzenes most affected porphyrin in metabolism."

            "Value": "4-Nitroaniline has measured log Koc values of 1.78(1) and 1.88(2) and log Kom values of 1.49(3) and 1.64(4). These values correspond to Koc values of 60, 76, 54 and 75, respectively. 4-Nitroaniline has also been observed to have a Koc of 87(5). According to a classification scheme(6), these Koc values suggest that 4-nitroaniline is expected to have high mobility in soil. 4-Nitroaniline was found to have a Kd value of 13.5 L/kg in homoionic K+ Montmorillonite type soil(7). However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(8,9), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). 4-Nitroaniline had small and scattered amounts of irreversible binding over a 20 hour experiment(10)."
