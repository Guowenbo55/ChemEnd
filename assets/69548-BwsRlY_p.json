            "content": "A series of 14C-labelled benzoic acids was synthesized to investigate their phloem translocation in plants and assess the role of pKa and lipophilicity in determining their movement. When these substituted benzoic acids were applied to castor bean plants by injection into the petioles, the compounds with intermediate lipophilicity (2-fluoro-, 4-chloro-, and 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acids) exhibited the highest concentrations in phloem exudates. On the other hand, the more polar 4-methyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro- and pentafluorobenzoic acids showed lower translocation, possibly due to their lower pKa values compared to the other benzoic acids tested. The polar 4-ureidobenzoic acid and the lipophilic 3-(4-methylphenoxy)benzoic acid were both translocated less efficiently in the phloem. These findings align with previous observations on phenoxyacetic acids and provide further evidence for the significance of ionization in the accumulation and retention of chemicals in phloem sieve tubes.",
