    "Description": "Musk xylene is a C-nitro compound that is m-xylene bearing three nitro substituents at positions 2, 4 and 6 as well as a tert-butyl group at position 5. It has a role as an explosive, a fragrance and a carcinogenic agent. It is functionally related to a 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and a m-xylene.",

Musk xylene was detected in 18 of 25 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus), thornback ray (Raia clavata), and saithe (Pollachius virens) fish livers and fillets from harbors in Norway in Winter 1997/98 at concentrations ranging from <0.1 ng/g lipids to 178 ng/g, average 28.9 ng/g lipids(2). Musk xylene was detected in trout collected from different fish farms in the western part of Denmark between September 1999 to January 2000 and again between September 2003 to January 2004 at concentrations ranging from <0.18 to 1.59 ug/kg fresh weight, median 0.52 ug/kg fresh weight and <0.23 and 1.30 ug/kg fresh weight, median <0.23 ug/kg fresh weight, respectively(3). Musk xylene was detected in wild brown trout muscle tissue, at concentrations of 48.7-262.2 ug/kg, sampled downstream from sewage treatment plants in Prachatice, Brloh, and Pacov, Czech Republic during June 2009; it was not detected above the limit of quantification upstream of these sites(4). Musk xylene was not detected in bullhead, shad, and perch fish sampled from Hamilton Harbor of Lake Ontario, the Detroit River, and western Lake Erie, in Spring 2002(5). Musk xylene was detected in fish from the alpine lakes in Grisons, Switzerland at concentrations in ng/g lipid based of 1.9, 12, 1.8, 1.9, 1.3, 2.5, and 2.2 in L. Tuma, L. Linghin, L. Moesols, Surettasee, L. Diavolezza, L. Teo, and L. Grond, respectively(6)."
