The quinones used for the study were 2-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (3602559), 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (481390) (juglone), and 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (117806) (dichlone).  For the 1,4-benzoquinones the extent of inhibition increased with an increasing number of halogen substituents.  No major importance was attached to the type of halogen nor the position of chlorine atoms.  The 2-methyl derivatives of 1,4-naphthoquinone did not inhibit GST activity.  A considerably higher inhibitory activity was noted for dichlone than for juglone.  Both the time course of the inhibition as well as the fact that removal of the inhibitor by ultrafiltration failed to restore the enzymatic activity indicated the irreversibility of the reaction.  The inhibition was slowed considerably by incubation of quinones and enzyme in the presence of the competitive inhibitor S-hexylglutathione.  Isoenzyme 3-3 was the most sensitive towards the whole series of inhibitors, whereas the activity of isoenzyme 2-2 was the least affected in all cases.  The authors suggest that the inhibition of quinones was probably due mainly to covalent modification of a specific cysteine residue in or near the active site.  The differential sensitivities of individual isoenzymes indicated that this residue was more accessible and/or more easily modified in isoenzyme 3-3 than in any of the other isoenzymes tested.  The findings suggested that quinones form a class of compounds from which a selective in-vivo inhibitor of the GST might be developed."

            "Value": "The addition of 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (CNQ) to substrate-depleted, GSH-supplemented rat liver mitochondria resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of reactable sulfhydryl groups and a concomitant increase in mitochondrial disulfide content at a ratio of 2 thiols depleted/disulfide generated. The molar ratio of thiol depleted/CNQ added approached 20 at low CNQ concentrations and was unity at higher doses. The addition of CNQ to substrate-depleted mitochondrial suspensions resulted in O2 consumption which increased with increasing concentrations of mitochondria and was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) which establishes the ability of CNQ to interact with mitochondrial thiol redox centers. The CNQ-mediated large amplitude swelling of rat liver mitochondria was exacerbated by thiol oxidizing agents and depressed by disulfide reducing agents. A redox cycling mechanism between mitochondrial thiol groups, CNQ and oxygen was proposed to lower the matrix glutathione pool and make the mitochondria more susceptable to toxic oxygen radicals which induce swelling in isolated mitochondrial suspensions. In support of this mechanism, alpha-tocopherol was shown to prevent the CNQ-mediated swelling process. Beef heart mitochondrial NADH was oxidized by CNQ in a 1/1 molar ratio anaerobically and in a 3/1 molar ratio under aerobic conditions, whereas the fully reduced quinone, CNQH2, oxidized NADH aerobically but not anaerobically. Thus, CNQ is capable of interacting with NADH of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in a redox cycling fashion."

Dose levels of 0.42, or 1.05 g CNQ/kg/wk were given to female Wistar-rats in a 2.5 g block of white chocolate as a palatable vehicle for ingestion studies. Because rats reduced intake of the vehicle almost to zero during chronic ingestion, acute ingestion experiments were carried out for 1 week; CNQ ingestion was 281.1 +/-47.7 mg for the medium dose level and 625.5 +/-147.4 mg for the high dose level. For subcutaneous studies, CNQ was given to male Long-Evans-rats at 16.6 mg/kg. Acute oral administration caused significant increases in cytochrome-P-450, DT-diaphorase, and aniline-hydroxylase activities. The increases in aniline-hydroxylase and DT-diaphorase were directly related to the concentration of CNQ and actual CNQ intake. At 24 and 48 hours after subcutaneous injection an increase was noted in mitochondrial DT-diaphorase activity. All enzyme activities were significantly different from controls by 48 hours post injection, suggesting that the first interaction of CNQ or a CNQ metabolite is at the mitochondrial level when subcutaneously administered. The authors concluded that the route of administration plays a significant role in determining the intracellular effects of CNQ."

The relationship of mutagenic potency to the one-electron reduction potential with TA104 suggested that the higher redox potential NQs were more mutagenic than the lower redox potential NQs. Significant reduction of the mutagenicity of 1,4-naphthoquinone without S9 mix was observed in the presence of catalase. Enhancement of the mutagenic potential of the NQs by the pKM101 plasmid implicated in error-prone repair was also observed.

The most obvious change in the labeling pattern during photoautotrophic 14CO2-fixation was a several-fold increase in 3-phosphoglyceric acid accompanied with a decrease in the amount of glutamate. In photoheterotrophic cells, quinones caused an appreciable increase in 14C-glycolic acid and concomitant decrease, although not proportional, in the amount of 14C-sugar phosphate. The level of 14C-incorporated in poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate and ether-extractable lipids was considerably decreased in photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic cells treated with quinones. The fact that the changes brought about in the 14CO2-labeling pattern by treatment with quinones were different in photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic cells is consistent with the presence of different pathways of CO2-fixation in these cells. The ability of quinones to interfere with the generation of reduced pyridine nucleotides, and their possible effects on sulfhydryl enzymes appear to be responsible for the reported changes in the path of 14CO2-fixation in photosynthetic bacteria."

            "Value": "Dichlone has been shown to be immobile in silty clay loam using soil thin layer chromatography as well as in soil columns and in soil drench tests(1). In one field test in which 0.4 lb/acre of active compound was applied to the soil in an apple orchard, 0.7 ppm dichlone was detected at 4-6 inch depth during the growing season. However the analytic method lacked sensitivity and results were erratic. None of the chemical survived to the next growing season(2)."
