The recovery of radioactivity from 14C-labeled ADS, specifically labeled at the C-1 position of the butylidene group, gradually decreased with a half-life of 11 days. The movement of radioactivity to other plant parts was limited, and the calculated residue levels of apparent ADS in the roots were 0.16, 0.0096, and 0.0020 ppm at 1.5, 4, and 6 months after treatment, respectively. The primary metabolite found in the treated leaves was a deallyloxylated compound (CM-I), while two minor metabolites were oxo-tetrahydrobenzoxazole derivatives (CM-II, CM-III). The levels of these metabolites peaked around 10 days after treatment, accounting for 18.0% (CM-I), 2.6% (CM-II), and 2.5% (CM-III) of the applied radioactivity. It was observed that the transformation of ADS also occurred under non-biological conditions, indicating a non-enzymatic mechanism of degradation.",

It is commonly used to control grassy weeds without causing harm to broadleaf crops such as soybean, cabbage, carrot, and sugar beet when applied post-emergence. In a study conducted in a greenhouse, a water solution of ADS with 500ppm of Tween-20 was sprayed on the foliage of ten corn and soybean plants per treatment at a water volume of 1000 L/ha. The fresh weights of the plants were measured three weeks after treatment, and the experiment was repeated twice. Another investigation aimed to assess the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-labeled ADS in corn (a sensitive plant) and soybean (a tolerant plant). The results of these experiments provide valuable insights into the herbicidal activity and effects of ADS on different plant species.",
