Following application to the fifth leaf, the protonated form, EA-HCl, exhibited reduced uptake and restricted mobility, with the majority of radioactivity remaining in the main shoot. This contrasted with the free EA-base, which was rapidly absorbed and translocated to the tillers, resulting in a uniform distribution of radioactivity in aboveground plant parts. The distribution patterns were maintained during ontogenesis, with kernels acting as a considerable sink at maturity. Notably, the decline of radioactivity in the whole plant was smaller for EA-HCl compared to the free base, and the protonated form showed distinct translocation patterns. The results underscore the significance of chemical form in influencing the translocation and absorption dynamics of Monoethanolamine hydrochloride in spring barley plants.",
