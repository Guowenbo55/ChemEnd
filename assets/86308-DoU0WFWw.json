It belongs to a new class of fungicides and has a heterocyclic, anilide derivative structure with an empirical formula of C\u2081\u2084H\u2081\u2085NO. Translocation studies using autoradiography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and combustion to radioactive carbon dioxide were conducted on almond floral tissues treated with 'C-E-0858 and 'C-iprodione. The fungicides were applied to either the petals or the sepals of closed blossoms on detached shoots from almond trees of different ages. The results showed that translocation of 'C-E-0858 into stamens and pistils ranged from 4 to 8% of the recovered radioactivity, while 'C-iprodione showed a lower translocation of 1 to 3% in the same tissues. On potted plants, translocation of the fungicides into internal floral parts ranged from 1 to 2% for E-0858 and was 1% for iprodione. Higher radioactive counts were observed in stamens and pistils when the fungicides were applied to the sepals rather than the petals. TLC analysis of 'C-E-0858-treated blossoms revealed three radioactive spots, but only the parent compound showed fungitoxic activity against the mycelium of Monilinia laxa. Some of the 'C-iprodione was converted into three radioactive products in almond blossoms, with the parent compound and one metabolite exhibiting fungitoxic activity against M. laxa. Bioassays demonstrated that E-0858 and iprodione applied to closed blossoms provided stamen protection similar to that of the systemic fungicide benomyl.",
