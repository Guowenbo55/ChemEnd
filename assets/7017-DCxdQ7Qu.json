            "Value": "An estimated BCF of 51 was calculated for o-phenylphenol(SRC), using a log Kow of 3.09(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Animals excrete o-phenylphenol as the parent compound and as the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates(4)."

Five-day theoretical BODs of 1.2-29.7% were measured using 1-50 ppm o-phenylphenol with the theoretical BOD generally decreasing with an increase in concn(4). In Sapromat respirometer studies using industrial activated sludge, inoculum from a communal clarification plant, or a sewage inocula, 5-day theoretical BODs ranged from 50-100%(5)."

The degradation potential of o-phenylphenol under methanogenic conditions was examined with an anaerobic digesting sludge from the United Kingdom(2). It was found that o-phenylphenol inhibited anaerobic degradation(2). However, high concentrations of o-phenylphenol were used in the experiment which could have inhibited microbial degradation(2). In a closed bottle test, o-phenylphenol reached 84% of its theoretical oxygen demand(3). At 16 mg/L, o-phenylphenol was found to inhibit biodegradation(3). The metabolic fate of o-phenylphenol under different anaerobic conditions was tested with sediment slurries and enrichment cultures obtained from a shallow anoxic aquifer(4). In a sulfate-reducing slurry, o-phenylphenol degraded at a rate of 2.12 uM/day with 97% degradation after 22 days incubation(4). In a methanogenic slurry, o-phenylphenol was degraded at a rate of 1.65uM/day with 70% degradation after 22 days(4)."

            "Value": "... A genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the cellular responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) exposed to 0.82 mM OPP for 20 and 60 minutes /was performed/ ...  Ortho-phenylphenol (OPP) upregulated the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal, virulence and membrane transport proteins after both treatment times. After 20 minutes of exposure to 0.82 mM OPP, genes involved in the exhibition of swarming motility and anaerobic respiration were upregulated. After 60 minutes of OPP treatment, the transcription of genes involved in amino acid and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were upregulated. Further, the transcription of the ribosome modulation factor (rmf) and an alternative sigma factor (rpoS) of RNA polymerase were downregulated after both treatment times. Results from this study indicate that after 20 minutes of exposure to OPP, genes that have been linked to the exhibition of anaerobic respiration and swarming motility were upregulated. This study also suggests that the downregulation of the rmf and rpoS genes may be indicative of the mechanism by which OPP causes decreases in cell viability in P. aeruginosa. Consequently, a protective response involving the upregulation of translation leading to the increased synthesis of membrane related proteins and virulence proteins is possibly induced after both treatment times. In addition, cell wall modification may occur due to the increased synthesis of lipopolysaccharide after 60 minutes exposure to OPP. This gene expression profile can now be utilized for a better understanding of the target cellular pathways of OPP in P. aeruginosa and how this organism develops resistance to OPP."

OPP downregulated the biosynthesis of many amino acids, which are required for protein synthesis. In particular, the genes encoding the enzymes of the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway which results in lysine biosynthesis were significantly downregualted. Intriguingly, ...  the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins was upregulated by OPP and at the same time, the genes encoding iron acquisition and transport were downregulated. The genes encoding virulence factors were upregulated and genes encoding phospholipids were downregulated upon 20 min exposure to OPP ... Using microarray analysis ... revealed novel information regarding the mode of action of OPP on Staphylococcus: OPP inhibits anabolism of many amino acids and highly downregulates the genes that encode the enzymes involved in the DAP pathway. Lysine and DAP are essential for building up the peptidoglycan cell wall. It was concluded that the mode of action of OPP is similar to the mechanism of action of some antibiotics. The discovery of this phenomenon provides useful information that will benefit further antimicrobial research on S. aureus."
