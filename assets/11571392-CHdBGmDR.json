    "Description": "Saflufenacil is a member of the class of sulfamides that is sulfamide in which one of the amino groups has been substituted by a methyl group an an isopropyl group, while the other has been substituted by a 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-[3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl]benzoyl group. An important BASF herbicide, not registered in Europe but sold in USA, Canada and several other countries to control weeds in a wide range of food crops. Often mixed with other products such as glyphosate. It has a role as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of sulfamides. It is functionally related to a uracil.",

            "content": "Research was conducted to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for safening winter wheat to post emergence-applied saflufenacil when mixed with 2,4-D amine or bentazon. Less than 10% of applied saflufenacil was absorbed when mixed with bentazon whereas absorption peaked at 16% at 14 days after treatment when saflufenacil was applied alone. Wheat plants absorbed 2.8- to 3.5-times more saflufenacil when saflufenacil was applied with 2,4-D amine compared to saflufenacil alone. Regardless of herbicide treatment and harvest timing, <10% of absorbed saflufenacil was translocated from the treated leaf to other plant parts. Safening of saflufenacil with bentazon is likely due to reduced absorption of saflufenacil into winter wheat plants. In the presence of crop oil concentrate, saflufenacil absorption was enhanced by 2,4-D amine. The influence of bentazon and 2,4-D amine on saflufenacil absorption in wheat plants likely explains the differences in wheat response observed in previous research.",

Compared to the addition of Merge (surfactant), the addition of both Transorb (i.e., commercial product, Transorb formulation with glyphosate) and Merge increased the cuticular absorption of [14C] saflufenacil in cabbage plants with thick epicuticular wax layers. However, in all cases, the addition of glyphosate reduced the translocation of [14C]saflufenacil in glyphosate-susceptible plants, while translocation was not affected in glyphosate-resistant canola. Moreover, the phytotoxicity of saflufenacil reduced the activity of glyphosate, possibly by reducing its translocation in all plant species studied. Increased absorption of saflufenacil by the addition of Transorb (i.e., Transorb formulation with glyphosate) plus Merge appears to increase its contact activity, thus the interaction of saflufenacil and glyphosate involves two separate processes, absorption and translocation.",
