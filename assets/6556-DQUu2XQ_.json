Following a 6.1 day lag period, isopentane was completely degraded using an activated sludge over the course of a 20 day incubation period under aerobic conditions(3). The half-life in seawater of a mixture containing isopentane, pentane, and cyclopentane was 2.4 days(4). Isopentane, present at 25-33 mg/L, reached 71.43% biodegradation in 28 days using an activated sludge inoculum in the Manometric Respirometry test(5)."

A total of 24 male and female rats per group were given 2-methylbutane by gavage at 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day. Males were dosed for 10 weeks prior to mating and during mating. Females were dosed from 2 weeks before mating to day 21 of lactation. At 1000 mg/kg/day, both genders exhibited an increase in adrenal gland weight, however, a decrease in body weight gain and food intake, an increase in kidney weight, and an increased incidence of histopathological changes of the kidney were also observed in male rats. No treatment-related effects of 2-methylbutane were found in relation to the reproductive capacity of parental animals or the pre- and post-natal development of the F1 generation. There were no treatment-related effects in either gender at </= 300 mg/kg/day. Under these experimental conditions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of 2-methylbutane was 300 mg/kg/day for general toxicity and 1000 mg/kg/day for reproductive capacity and pup development in rats."

Male mice of ICR strain were fed with 80 mg/kg b.w. of phenobarbital for consecutive four days and exposed to n-pentane or isopentane for one hour. This resulted in an increase in the amount of 2-pentanol and 2-pentanone in the n-pentane inhalation and 2-methyl-2-butanol in the isopentane inhalation experiment. The toxicity of each metabolite was studied on cultured cells. The metabolites were individually mixed with HeLa S3 cell suspension, incubated for three days, and their concentration which inhibited the growth of cells by 50% (IGC 50) were compared. It was demonstrated as a result that the IGC 50 for any of the metabolites was lower than that for methanol, ethanol or acetone used as control."
