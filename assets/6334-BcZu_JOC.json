            "Value": "AEROBIC: Within 24 hr, propane was oxidized to its corresponding methyl ketone, acetone(1-3), and the corresponding alcohols, 1-propanol and 2-propanol, by cell suspensions of over 20 methyltrophic organisms isolated from lake water and soil samples. After 192 hr, the trace concn of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline(4). The average propane utilization by microflora of 5 soils was 23 and 32% for single and mixed alkanes, respectively(5). The respective gas exchange and degradation rate constants were 0.67X10-5 sq cm sec-1 and 0.033 day-1 for propane contained in a model estuarine ecosystem at 10 \u00b0C and a salinity of 30 parts per trillion; the corresponding biodegradation half-life ranged from 33 to 99 days(6). At 20 \u00b0C and a salinity of 30 parts/per trillion, the respective gas exchange and degradation rate constants were 0.92X10-5 sq cm sec-1 and 0.120 day-1; the corresponding biodegradation half-life for n-propane ranged from 7 to 9 days(6)."

            "Value": "The degradation of n-alkanes by microorganisms is similar to the degradation of fatty acids. The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of a molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having different rates of activity. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxidase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes. ... /n-Alkanes/"
