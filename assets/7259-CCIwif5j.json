            "Value": "The Koc of 2,5-xylidine is estimated as approximately 240(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 1.83(1) and a regression-derived equation(2,SRC). According to a recommended classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,5-xylidine has moderate mobility in soil(SRC). However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5). Low adsorption is observed at a neutral pH with pure clay minerals or soils for substituted anilines(5)."
