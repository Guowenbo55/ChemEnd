    "Description": "Quizalofop-P is a 2-{4-[(6-chloroquinoxalin-2-yl)oxy]phenoxy}propanoic acid that has R configuration. An acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor, it is used (generally as the corresponding ethyl or tefuryl ester proherbicides) for the control of annual and perennial grass weeds in sugar beet. It has a role as an EC 6.4.1.2 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) inhibitor. It is a 2-{4-[(6-chloroquinoxalin-2-yl)oxy]phenoxy}propanoic acid and a quinoxaline herbicide. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-quizalofop.",

Laboratory experiments were conducted on yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca) to determine the effect of mixing bromoxynil with the ethyl ester of quizalofop-P on absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-quizalofop-P Applying bromoxynil in mixture with quizalofop-P reduced 14C-label absorption from 63 to 51%, 73 to 52%, 77 to 68%, and 90 to 80% at 4, 8, 24, and 96 h after treatment, respectively. Translocation of 14C-label from the treated leaf into the shoot above or shoot below was unaffected by bromoxynil. However, translocation into the roots was reduced from 0.9 to 0.4% and 1.0 to 0.5% at 4 and 8 h after treatment, respectively, but differences were not noted at 0.5, 1, 24, and 96 h after treatment. Bromoxynil increased deesterification of quizalofop-P-ethyl into quizalofop-P acid from 45 to 60% in the shoot above the treated leaf. However, bromoxynil did not affect metabolism of quizalofop-P in the treated leaf or shoot below the treated leaf. These results suggest that antagonism of quizalofop-P activity by bromoxynil is primarily due to decreased absorption of quizalofop-P, whereas effects on translocation and metabolism were minor.",
