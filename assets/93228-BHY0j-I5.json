    "Description": "Fluoroimide is a maleimide that is substituted at positions 3 and 4 by chlorines and on the nitrogen by a p-fluorophenyl group. Previously used as a fungicide (now obsolete). It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is an organofluorine pesticide, a member of maleimides, an organochlorine pesticide, a dicarboximide fungicide and a member of monofluorobenzenes.",

Half lives of Fluoroimide applied on the leaves and fruits were about 20 days and 30 days, respectively. It remained mainly unchanged on the applied surface and was slowly absorbed by the plant. Only 2 % of applied Fluoroimide was translocated into the leaves 9 days after treatment, and 9% and 18% of applied radioactivity were absorbed and translocated into the leaves and fruits, respectively, after 93 days. A main metabolite of Fluoroimide was sodium 4-fluorodichloromaleanilate, a hydrolyzed compound of imide ring, that was identified by MS, IR, NMR and FX. Other four metabolites, such as 4-fluoroaniline, (E)-2, 3-dichloro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)acrylamide, N-(4-fluorophenyl) maleimide and N-(4-fluorophenyl) succinimide, were identified by cochromatography on tlc and MS, but residual amounts of these metabolites were quite low both in the leaves and fruits. It is considered that succinimide moiety of a reduced metabolite was derived from dichloromaleic acid portion of Fluoroimide, but not from the plant component.",
