            "content": "The study investigated the impact of two fatty amine surfactants, Armoblen 557 and Ethomeen T/27, on the foliar absorption, translocation, and efficacy of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid triethanolamine salt (2,4-DTR). The results showed that both surfactants significantly enhanced the foliar absorption of 2,4-DTR in black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) when applied at a concentration of 0.5% (w/v), increasing absorption by a factor of 4. However, applying the surfactants at a concentration of 0.05% (w/v) had no effect on absorption. The surfactants also reduced the translocation efficiency of 14C from 2,4-DTR in black nightshade by a factor of 1.5-2. Additionally, both surfactants greatly improved the efficacy of 2,4-DTR when applied at a concentration of 2.4 mM in the spray solution. At a higher concentration of 11.3 mM, the surfactants enhanced efficacy at a concentration of 0.5% but not at 0.05%. The findings suggested that altering the hydrophilic/lipophilic characteristics of the fatty amine surfactant by incorporating propylene oxide groups did not influence the absorption and efficacy of 2,4-DTR.",

The concentrations of 2,4-DTR (labeled plus unlabeled) were 11.3 mM (specific activity 29.47 MBq mmol-1), equivalent to the molarity of 2,4-D acid when applied at a rate of 1 kg ha-1 at a spray volume of 400 L ha-1. The specific activity of the radioactive 2,4-DTR was 12.8 x 1010 and 44.8 x 1010 Bq/tmol-1, respectively. Additional solutions were prepared in which 2,4-DTR and 2,4-D were combined, and the 14C-label was associated with either 2,4-DTR or 2,4-D.",

It took 1 h to apply all of the herbicide solutions.",
                "Other Information": "The experiments were part of a program using several species. Acetone was added to the 2,4-DTR solutions to facilitate the application of drops to difficult-to-wet leaf surfaces. The efficiency of the washing procedure was extensively tested, and recovery of 100% was measured."
