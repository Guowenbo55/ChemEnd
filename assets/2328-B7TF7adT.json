'Bohemian Chili') exhibited similar patterns of uptake and translocation of 14C-bentazon, a herbicide. The majority of the absorbed 14C remained in the treated leaves, with limited movement towards other parts of the plants. Interestingly, hot pepper showed a significantly faster rate of herbicide metabolism compared to sweet pepper at 1 and 4 days after application. Methanol extracts from both pepper species contained two unidentified metabolites of bentazon. These findings suggest variations in the metabolism of bentazon between the two pepper species.",

Merr.]. Significantly greater 14C-movement and herbicide toxicity occurred in common cocklebur growing in wet soil at field capacity than in dry soil near the wilting point. In common cocklebur there was a trend toward greater bentazon toxicity and 14C-translocation at high temperature (35 C) and high relative humidity (RH) (96%) than at low temperature (25 C) and low RH (35%). \u2018Lee 68\u2019 soybeans were injured less than 10% by bentazon under any environmental condition of this study. Translocation of 14C was primarily acropetal in both common cocklebur and soybeans. Herbicide movement was affected by leaf maturity with the greatest movement of 14C resulting from 14C-bentazon applied to the most mature common cocklebur leaf near the base of the shoot and to soybeans at the youngest fully expanded leaf near the apex of the shoot. Bentazon was more toxic and 14C translocation was greater in the soybean cultivar \u2018Hurrelbrink\u2019 than \u2018Hill\u2019 or Hill X Hurrelbrink cross.\n",
