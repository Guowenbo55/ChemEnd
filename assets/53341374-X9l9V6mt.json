    "Description": "Broflanilide is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3-[benzoyl(methyl)amino]-2-fluorobenzoic acid with the amino group of 2-bromo-4-(1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropan-2-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)aniline. An insecticide that exhibits high larvicidal activity against Spodoptera litura and is effective against pests with resistance to cyclodienes and fipronil It has a role as an agrochemical, a GABA antagonist and an insecticide. It is a member of benzamides, a member of monofluorobenzenes, an organofluorine insecticide, a member of bromobenzenes and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes.",

However, uptake, translocation and residual distribution of BFI, ADP, and FPO in plants remain unclear. Therefore, residues distribution, uptake, and translocation of BFI, ADP, and FPO were investigated in mustard field trials and hydroponic experiments. The field results indicated that the residues of BFI, ADP,and FPO were 0.001\u20131.87 mg/kg at 0\u201321 d and dissipated fast in mustard (half-lives=5.2\u201311.3 d). More than 66.5 % of FPO residues were distributed in the cell-soluble fractions because of their high hydro_x0002_philicity, while hydrophobic BFI and ADP were primarily stored in the cell walls and organelles. The hydroponic data showed that the foliar uptake rates of BFI, ADP, and FPO were weak (bioconcentration factors<1), but the root uptake rate was strong (bioconcentration factors>1). The upward and downward translations of BFI, ADP, and FPO were limited (translation factor<1). BFI and ADP are uptake by roots via apoplast pathway, and FPO is uptake via symplastic pathway. This study contributes to the understanding of the formation of pesticide residues in plants and provides a reference for safe application and risk assessment of BFI, ADP, and FPO. ",
