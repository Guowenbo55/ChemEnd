Amitrole was absorbed more readily than fosamine or glyphosate, and while initial translocation of amitrole was faster, eventually more 14C was recovered from plants treated with glyphosate and fosamine. Radioactivity from all three compounds was translocated to areas of meristematic activity, such as shoot and rhizome apices and rhizome nodes, but the amounts recovered from roots and rhizomes were small relative to the amounts applied. Root exudation and guttation may have contributed to herbicide loss, with radioactivity from amitrole being particularly prevalent in guttation fluid.",
