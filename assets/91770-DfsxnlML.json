It is a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid, an imidazolone, a member of imidazolines and a member of methylpyridines.",

Imazapic applied early postemergence alone at 71 g/ha provided excellent weed control, maximum yields, and optimum economic returns. Variations of this treatment, such as using a half rate of imazapic alone, tank mixing with other herbicides, or supplementing with other herbicides, often resulted in equivalent weed control and yield but did not improve economic return. Greenhouse studies on Florida beggarweed control showed that control was independent of application type when seedlings were less than 20 days old, with foliage-only and foliage plus soil applications equally effective. Imazapic was less effective against seedlings older than 20 days, which produced trifoliate leaves instead of unifoliate leaves. Absorption of 14C-imazapic by unifoliate and trifoliate leaves was equivalent, but translocation was greater in unifoliate leaves, contributing to imazapic tolerance in older Florida beggarweed seedlings.",
