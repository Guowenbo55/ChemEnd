The dissipation rates of PAEs in the sediment exhibited a positive correlation with exposure time, with over 68.12% reduction observed after 28 days, even under high initial concentrations. All five PAEs were taken up by the roots from contaminated sediment, translocated into stems and leaves, and their content in each tissue showed significant linear correlations with the sediment content. DEHP demonstrated the highest transportation from sediment to roots and stems, followed by BBP, DBP, DIBP, and DAP, while the order of transportation from roots to leaves was reversed. Throughout the 28-day exposure, the average concentration of each PAE in stems was the highest, followed by roots, leaves, and edible parts. DEHP and BBP were identified as major contaminants in edible parts but were deemed safe for human health. The accumulation of PAEs in edible parts was influenced by various factors, including PAE species and concentration, survival time, and harvest time of edible parts. The study highlighted the potential of Zizania latifolia not only as a safe food source but also as a promising plant for remediating contaminated sediment by accumulating and degrading PAEs from the environment.",
