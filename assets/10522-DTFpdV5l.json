            "Value": "AEROBIC: The rate at which chlorobenzilate degrades in microbial growth media increases when citrate is incorporated(1). This may be due to a reductive decarboxylation process that the citrate stimulates(1). The half-life of chlorobenzilate in two fine sandy soils was estimated to be 1.5-5 weeks following application of 0.5-1.0 ppm; removal was probably microbial(2). It is decarboxylated to 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone by a yeast isolated from insecticide treated soil under anaerobic conditions(3,4). In 22 days, 40, 29, and 39% of the (14)C-ring-labeled chlorobenzilate added to sediment-free water samples from 3 fresh water lakes was converted to organic products; no (14)CO2 evolution was detected(5). Addition of sediment to the water samples from the three lakes gave (14)CO2 yields 3.6, 0.0, and 18.3%(5). Chlorobenzilate was metabolized in water from another freshwater lake only when glucose and inorganic nutrients were added and mineralized to (14)CO2 only when sediment was also added to the water(5). Chlorobenzilate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(6). Half-lives for chlorobenzilate in Lukang silty clay loam and Pincheng clay ranged from 15.1 days at 10 \u00b0C to 10.8 days at 25 \u00b0C; and 169.1 days at 10 \u00b0C to 29.5 days at 25 \u00b0C, respectively(7)."
