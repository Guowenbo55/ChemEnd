            "Value": "A class of angiogenesis inhibitor has emerged from our  mechanistic study of the action of angiogenin, a potent angiogenic factor. Neomycin, an  aminoglycoside antibiotic, inhibits nuclear translocation of human angiogenin in human  endothelial cells, an essential step for angiogenin-induced angiogenesis. The phospholipase  C-inhibiting activity of neomycin appears to be involved, because U-73122, another  phospholipase C inhibitor, has a similar effect. In contrast, genistein, oxophenylarsine, and  staurosporine, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and protein kinase  C, respectively, do not inhibit nuclear translocation of angiogenin. Neomycin inhibits  angiogenin-induced proliferation of human endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. At 50  microM, neomycin abolishes angiogenin-induced proliferation but does not affect the basal  level of proliferation and cell viability. Other aminoglycoside antibiotics, including  gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, and paromomycin, have no effect on  angiogenin-induced cell proliferation. Most importantly, neomycin completely inhibits  angiogenin-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane at a dose as low as 20  ng per egg. These results suggest that neomycin and its analogs are a class of agents that may  be developed for anti-angiogenin therapy."

Aminoglycosides are aminocyclitols that kill bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis as they bind to the 16S rRNA and by disrupting the integrity of bacterial cell membrane. Aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms include: (a) the deactivation of aminoglycosides by N-acetylation, adenylylation or O-phosphorylation, (b) the reduction of the intracellular concentration of aminoglycosides by changes in outer membrane permeability, decreased inner membrane transport, active efflux, and drug trapping, (c) the alteration of the 30S ribosomal subunit target by mutation, and (d) methylation of the aminoglycoside binding site. ... /Aminoglycosides/"
