Ethanol and 1-hexanol were found to have two competing concentration-dependent effects on the Ca(2+)- and phorbol ester- or diacylglycerol-dependent activities of PKCalpha associated with either RhoA or Cdc42, consisting of a potentiation at low alcohol levels and an attenuation of activity at higher levels. Measurements of the Ca(2+), phorbol ester, and diacylglycerol concentration-response curves for Cdc42-induced activation indicated that the activating effect corresponded to a shift in the midpoints of each of the curves to lower activator concentrations, while the attenuating effect corresponded to a decrease in the level of activity induced by maximal activator levels. The presence of ethanol enhanced the interaction of PKCalpha with Cdc42 within a concentration range corresponding to the potentiating effect, whereas the level of binding was unaffected by higher ethanol levels that were found to attenuate activity."
