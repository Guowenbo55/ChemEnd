Twenty grams of dorsal fish muscle were extracted and the residues analyzed by GLC; reagent blanks and spike samples were included with each sample. The waters from which the fish were obtained receive drainage from industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Water samples were not assayed for specific components. Assays for aldrin indicated it was present in low concns. The highest value obtained was 19.9 ug/kg in Sargus vulgarius from Abu Qir Bay. Aldrin was present in low and similar amounts (1.1-3.5 ug/kg) in small and medium sized Tilapia nilotica. Size ranges of Tilapia zilli showed variation of 5.7 ug/kg (small) to 13.1 ug/kg (large) in the concn of aldrin in muscle tissue. All samples were well below permissible levels for aldrin(1)."

For calves one to two weeks old the minimum toxic dose was found to be 5 mg/kg and for cattle and sheep 25 mg/kg. A concentration of 5 ppm in the diet is fatal to young pheasants."

Optimal in vitro assay conditions for the epoxidase were pH 7.6 and 31~C. Activity was linear up to 40 min of incubation time & 0.5 mg microsomal protein/incubation. The activity was concentrated in the microsomal fraction of whole body homogenates & was NADPH-dependent. The effect of atrazine exposure on aldrin epoxidase was measured to determine if this herbicide induces cytochrome P450-dependent activity. Comparisons of control & atrazine-exposed midges indicated incr epoxidase activity as a result of atrazine exposure, & a 45 kDa protein of incr intensity was observed after SDS-PAGE of microsomal protein. The molecular weight of this protein was similar in size to cytochrome P450 enzymes reported for other insects. Heme staining of SDS- PAGE gels & immunochemical studies using a Drosophila melanogaster anti-P450 polyclonal antiserum, further support the cytochrome P450 nature of this inducible 45 kDa protein."
