The Koc for 2-nitrophenol in Brookston clay loam was 114(3). In sorption studies using peat, 2-nitrophenol had measured Koc values of 85 (when 2-nitrophenol was in the neutral state) and 13 (when 2-nitrophenol existed as anionic species)(4). According to a classification scheme(5), a Koc range of 13 to 265 suggests that 2-nitrophenol is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of 2-nitropehnol is 7.23(6), indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(7)."
