    "Description": "Picric acid is a C-nitro compound comprising phenol having three nitro substtituents at the 2-, 4- and 6-positions. It has a role as an explosive, an antiseptic drug and a fixative. It is functionally related to a 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and a phenol. It is a conjugate acid of a picrate anion.",

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of picric acid can be estimated to be 2250(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that picric acid is expected to have slight mobility in soil. The pKa of picric acid is 0.24(3), indicating that this compound will exist entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4)."
