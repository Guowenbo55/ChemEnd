            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc for cyanoacetic acid can be estimated to be 1(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that cyanoacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil(SRC). In addition, the pKa of cyanoacetic acid is 2.45(3), indicating that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in the environment, and anions generally possess higher mobility in soil than their neutral counterpart(4)."
