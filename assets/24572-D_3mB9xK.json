    "Description": "Lead arsenate is an inorganic lead salt composed from lead(2+) and arsenate dianion. It was widely used in the United States in the 1950's as an insecticide to control pests in fruit orchards, specifically apples and cherries. It has a role as an insecticide, a plant growth regulator and a rodenticide. It contains a lead(2+) and an arsenate(2-).",

            "Value": "Gray and Ryan observed that when acid lead arsenate was used, there was a significant reduction in acidity in the oranges, likely due to the soluble arsenic released on the foliage. Additionally, they noted that all the fruits examined from the sprayed trees showed reduced acidity. This implies that the impact of the arsenate spray on acidity was not limited to the surface of the foliage but affected the entire tree systemically, leading to changes in the fruit quality."
