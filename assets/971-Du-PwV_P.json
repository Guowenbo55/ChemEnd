Furthermore, oxylate may constitute as much as 50% of the dry weight of some plant organs, serving both an excretory and a storage function by chelating and precipitating excess calcium ions(3). Oxylate concns ranged from 0.1 to 5.0% in several plant species that are potential sources of the oxylates in sediments of Searsville Lake, CA, Lake Tahoe, CA, Big Soda Lake, NV, and a south San Francisco Bay mud flat and salt marsh(3)."

Although sugar beet tops are harmful to animals when fresh, they can be fed without ill effect once the tops have wilted. This is said to be due to conversion of harmful soluble salts into harmless insoluble ones during the process, but there is contrary evidence on this point and the question is complicated by the fact that oxalate is not the only toxic substance in sugar beet tops; they can contain lethal quantities of nitrate. /Oxalates/"

            "Value": "Deposition of calcium oxalate is responsible for the pathologic manifestations of oxalosis and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction in uremia and to the progression of renal damage after renal failure is established. A rat model of oxalosis using a single intravenous injection of sodium oxalate, 0.3 mmol/kg body weight, in rats has been developed. Polarized light microscopy and section freeze dry auto radiography were used to identify (14)C-oxalate within the renal parenchyma and in extrarenal organs. (14)C-oxalate crystals under 3 u in length were identified within one min of injection in proximal tubule lumens. Section freeze dry autoradiography showed occasional minute crystals within glomeruli, heart, lung and liver at one hr. In contrast to concentrative cellular uptake demonstrated in rat renal cortical slices in vitro, intracellular accumulation of (14)C-oxalate could not be detected in vivo. Within the first 24 hr, renal oxalate retention reached amaximum of 25 + or - 4 % of the injected dose/gm kidney compared to a maximum of only 7 + or - 3 %/gm kidney after ip administration. Although less than 1 % dose/gm kidney remained after one week, crystal fragments were scattered throughout the cortex and medulla, often surrounded by foci of interstitial nephritis. The retention of crystals in kidney and other body organs following iv oxalate provides a model of oxalosis which stimulates pathophysiologic events in a variety of clinical situations characterized by transiently or persistently elevated serum oxalate."
