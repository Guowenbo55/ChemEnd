Lipophilic in nature, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid applied as a spray concn of 1 g/l to maize, rape, strawberry, and sugar beet resulted in plant uptake rates of 26, 98, 96, and 61% of amount applied, respectively, after 24 hrs; plants characterized by waxy leaves exhibited more rapid uptake(2). Use of a surfactant (NP8, nonylphenol) decreased the rate of absorption to 17, 15, 35, and 13%, respectively(2)."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is 4.23(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the dissociated form in the environment and anions generally have greater mobility than their neutral counterparts(5)."
