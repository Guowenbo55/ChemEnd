            "Value": "AEROBIC: m-Cresol was degraded 99-100% in 7 and 2 days at 4 and 20 \u00b0C, respectively in river die-away tests(1). Die-away studies were performed in freshwater, estuarine water, and marine water from sites near Newport, NC throughout the year(2). In estuarine water the half-life ranged from 1-6 days(2). Rates were faster in freshwater and slower in marine water(2). While rates were highest during the summer in fresh and estuarine waters, the rate of degradation in marine water was almost independent of the season(2). m-Cresol was completely degraded in soil in 11 days at an application rate of 500 ppm(3). Low concentrations (39 ppb) of m-cresol degraded in subsurface materials taken from an uncontaminated aquifer(4). There was a linear increase in biodegradation with time over the 160 day experiment with a 0.07% per day average mineralization rate(4). When the concentration of m-cresol was increased to 788 ppb, no mineralization was observed(4). The disproportionate decrease in concentration of m-cresol in groundwater down-gradient from a wood-preserving facility has been ascribed to biodegradation(5). The biodegradation half-life of m-cresol in aerobic natural waters was reported to range from 2-29 days(6). Pure cultures isolated from reed-sedge peat bogs resulted in 99.3 % degradation of m-cresol during a 48 hour incubation period(7). The first-order aerobic biodegradation rate constant of m-cresol was reported as 0.0031/day(8), corresponding to a half-life of about 222 days(SRC). Biodegradation half-lives of 0.6 and 11.3 days were reported for m-cresol in 2 agricultural soils(9). Based upon available test results, including OECD screening methods, m-cresol can be considered as being readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions(10); in surface waters and sediments, half-lives in the range of hours to a few days are expected(10). Using OECD Guideline 301D (Closed-Bottle Test), m-cresol had 65-90% degradation over a 28-day incubation period(10). Using OECD Guideline 301C (Electrolytic Respirometry Test), m-cresol had 80-95% degradation over a 40-day incubation period(10). Using OECD Guideline 302B (Zahn-Wellens Test), m-cresol had 95.5-96% degradation over 5 and 10-day incubation periods(10)."

No mineralization occurred in 29 weeks, however, when it was incubated with anaerobic freshwater sediment(1). m-Cresol was degraded 75% in an anaerobic digester sludge over a 10 week incubation period(2). m-Cresol was completely degraded in creosote contaminated groundwater in 37 days (lag time, 25 days) at 10 \u00b0C and 12 days (lag time, 8 days) at 20 \u00b0C under nitrate reducing conditions(3). No mineralization occurred when m-cresol was incubated anaerobically for 40 days at 37 \u00b0C with a sludge inoculum(4). The biodegradation half-life of m-cresol in anaerobic natural waters was reported to range from 15 to 49 days(5). Using adapted anaerobic sludge inoculum, m-cresol (300 mg/L concentration) degraded about 100% after 9 days with most of the m-cresol (87%) converted to methane(6). A 92% evolution of methane was observed in an anaerobic test using municipal sludge and m-cresol at 50 mg/L(6). Using a phenol-enriched methanogenic culture, m-cresol (100 mg/L) had an 85% theoretical CH4 production after 58 days of incubation(6)."

A similar Koc range is expected for m-cresol(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value indicates that m-cresol is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil."
