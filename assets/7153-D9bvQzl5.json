In dry and flooded soil (25% and 200% of water holding capacity) at 20 \u00b0C, the half-lives increased to 10 and 15 days, respectively. The half-life decreased by 43% when the concentration of mecoprop was decreased by a factor of 10. Comparing the half-lives of mecoprop in surface soil and subsurface soil, the investigators found half-lives of mecoprop in an undisturbed soil column of a coarse sandy soil to be 7 days at 0-33 cm depth, 70 days at 33-66 cm depth and 34 days at 66-99 cm depth. In these experiments when half of the mecoprop had disappeared, 12% of the 14C was recovered as CO2 and when 90% of the mecoprop had disappeared, 50% of the 14C was evolved as CO2. The degradation intermediates were not identified(1). Using UV absorption, HPLC, GC-MS and other techniques to monitor the course of mecoprop biodegradation using enriched mixed culture from a soil sample, biodegradation was incomplete (75%) and 4-chloro-2-methylphenol was an intermediate(2). GC-MS data also suggested that other phenolic compounds with repositioned chloro and methyl groups are formed(2). The half-life of mecoprop in clay loam, heavy clay loam, and sandy loam soils at 20 \u00b0C and 85% field moisture capacity was 9, 8, and 7 days, respectively(3). An experiment in which the UV absorption was used to monitor the disappearance of mecoprop (50-80 ppm) with an inoculum of Mardin silt loam, Honeoye silt loam and Dunkirk silt loam; 100% degradation, as typified by the loss of the aromatic ring, was not completely obtained in 47, 124, and 205 days, respectively when incubated at 30 \u00b0C and pH 7.2(4). Using undisturbed soil core techniques and different applications of 14C-ring labeled mecoprop, biodegradation studies were performed resulting in 14.2 to 25.07% 14CO2 evolution over the 90 day study period(5).

The difference in susceptibility between the two biotypes could not be ascribed to quantitative differences in absorption or translocation of radiolabel. In fact, more 14C was absorbed into and translocated from leaves of the resistant biotype. Patterns of 14C translocation in the two biotypes were similar and, therefore, could not explain herbicide susceptibilty either. Spraying both biotypes with unlabelled mecoprop prior to [14C]mecoprop application had no significant effect on absorption, but tended to decrease the amount of radiolabel translocated out of the treated leaves of both biotypes, particularly to the roots. Herbicide metabolism was studied in the 14C-treated leaf tissues, where most of the radioactivity remained over the 72-hr experimental period. Both biotypes converted substantial amounts of [14C]mecoprop to more polar constituents, presumed to be conjugated metabolites. However, there was significantly less conjugation in the susceptible compared with the resistant biotype, resulting in more parent herbicide being available in the susceptible plants. Differential metabolism, forming nonherbicidal conjugates, is proposed as a possible mechanism of resistance to mecoprop in S. media.",
