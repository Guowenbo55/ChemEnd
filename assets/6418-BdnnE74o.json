            "content": "The study investigated the absorption and translocation of 14C-dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) in johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.). Johnsongrass plants were pot-grown in a greenhouse and then treated, followed by placement in controlled-environment chambers. It was found that absorption of 14C-dalapon into johnsongrass leaves and subsequent translocation occurred continuously within the plant over a 48-hour period after treatment. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that the dalapon molecule was translocated intact. Additionally, absorption and translocation of 14C-dalapon increased with an increase in the droplet volume of the diluent. Translocation of 14C-dalapon from a 2-cm treated leaf section into the plant was influenced by temperature and humidity, with varying effects observed at different conditions. The addition of surfactant and potassium phosphate to the dalapon solution increased translocation, especially under high-temperature conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors affecting the absorption and translocation of dalapon in johnsongrass, which can be useful for optimizing herbicide application practices.",

In one experiment, alternate leaves were maintained at 35% and 100% RH by enveloping in plastic bags with wet/dry filter papers. The 14C remaining on leaf surfaces was determined by washing detached leaf sections and measuring radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry."

Beauv.) growing under field conditions in the autumn with aerial shoots 40-50 cm long, both compounds moved in both symplast and apoplast. However, dalapon was less mobile in the symplast than aminotriazole, with negligible amounts of dalapon translocated to the rhizomes. Nodes of the treated shoots acted as barriers to translocation, more so for dalapon than aminotriazole. Application to a basal green leaf led to a more uniform distribution of the compounds within plants and rhizomes compared to application to the youngest fully-expanded leaf. In couch plants with aerial shoots 10-15 cm long treated in the stubble, both aminotriazole and dalapon were mainly restricted to the treated shoots, with trace amounts found in the rhizomes and untreated shoots even 15 days after application.",
