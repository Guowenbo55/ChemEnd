            "Value": "AEROBIC: Under aerobic conditions, 2,2-dimethylbutane was shown to degrade after a 15 day lag period when tested as a mixture of light hydrocarbons in activated sludge (14% of the initial amount remained after 34 days of incubation). However, when tested as the single carbon source little degradation was observed (86% of the initial amount remained; comparable to the abiotic control where 89% remained) suggesting that its degradation may occur via co-metabolism(1). In another aerobic biodegradation study of gasoline hydrocarbons in water from a domestic sewage treatment plant, a degradation half-life for 2,2-dimethylbutane was calculated as 26.5 days(2). Under optimal conditions, biodegradation results for gasoline in activated sludge indicate that 2,2-dimethylbutane constituted a recalcitrant portion of the mixture(3)."
