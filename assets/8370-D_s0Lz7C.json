    "Description": "Hexachlorobenzene is a member of the class of chlorobenzenes that is benzene in which all of the hydrogens are replaced by chlorines. An agricultural fungicide introduced in the mid-1940s and formerly used as a seed treatment, its use has been banned since 1984 under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. It has a role as a persistent organic pollutant, a carcinogenic agent and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of chlorobenzenes and an aromatic fungicide.",

The uptake of chlorobenzenes by midge larvae was rapid for all compounds, and apparent steady state conditions were reached within 48 hrs of exposure. Bioconcentration factors for the accumulation of chlorobenzenes from sediments and from interstitial and overlying waters were related to the octanol/water partition coefficients of the cmpd.

            "Value": "Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a widespread organochlorine pesticide, considered a possible human carcinogen. It is a dioxin-like compound and a weak ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We have found that HCB activates c-Src/HER1/STAT5b and HER1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways and cell migration, in an AhR-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effect of HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5uM) on cell invasion and metalloproteases (MMPs) 2 and 9 activation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we examined in vivo the effect of HCB (0.3, 3, 30mg/kg bw) on tumor growth, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, and metastasis using MDA-MB-231 xenografts and two syngeneic mouse breast cancer models (spontaneous metastasis using C4-HI and lung experimental metastasis using LM3). /The/ results show that HCB (5uM) enhances MMP2 expression, as well as cell invasion, through AhR, c-Src/HER1 pathway and MMPs. Moreover, HCB increases MMP9 expression, secretion and activity through a HER1 and AhR-dependent mechanism, in MDA-MB-231 cells. HCB (0.3 and 3mg/kg bw) enhances subcutaneous tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 and C4-HI in vivo models.

This uncoupling is due to the action of pentachlorophenol endogenously formed by metabolism of HCB.

            "Value": "Immunoreactive and catalytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was measured in the livers of rodents made porphyric by hexachlorobenzene (HCB). Catalytic activity decreased progressively as porphyria developed but was not accompanied by a fall in the concentration of immunoreactive enzyme protein. These findings suggest that HCB specifically inactivates uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase without affecting those regions of the molecule that determine its antigenic activity and without increasing its rate of catabolism. In vitro, uroporphyrin-catalysed photoinactivation of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was similarly unaccompanied by loss of immunoreactivity, whereas reaction of sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide led to loss of both catalytic activity and immunoreactivity. HCB may induce chronic porphyria by modifying sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme; the effect is restricted to catalytic or substrate-binding sites."

            "Value": "The effect of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) on microsomal cytochromes p450 and b5, monooxygenase activity and membrane composition was examined in male and female Fischer rats. Cytochrome p450 was induced more in males than in females while cytochrome b5 was induced only in males. Analysis of patterns of induction of microsomal monooxygenases showed that aminopyrine-N-demethylase activity doubled in both sexes after treatment while aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was 16 times the control value in the females and 1.5 times in the males. After HCB treatment, the phospholipid content of microsomal membranes per gram of liver was increased in both sexes while cholesterol was unchanged. Analysis of the phospholipids pattern showed that the percentage of sphingomyelin decreased significantly (50% of the control value) while phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine did not change. These changes resulted in reduced membrane microviscosity and indicate that HCB interferes with the biosynthesis of phospholipids containing choline. Free fatty acid content dropped in both sexes but females were more affected; free arachidonic acid rose in females. HCB induction of microsomal cytochromes and monooxygenases was accompanied by marked modifications of membrane composition."

Microsomes were prepared from male Wistar rats induced with 0.1% HCB for 14 days. Following 10 minute incubations with radiolabelled HCB, soluble radioactivity was extracted with ether, dried and residues dissolved in methanol for high performance liquid chromatography. Effects of 0 to 1.0 mM ascorbic acid or glutathione on HCB microsomal incubations were tested. Incubations with radiolabelled pentachlorophenol were also examined. To determine covalent binding to protein after ether extraction the aqueous (protein) samples were extracted with methanol, ethanol, and ether, dried, and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Anaerobic incubations were also performed. The metablites formed by microsomal metabolism of HCB were pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorohydroquinone. A considerable amount of covalent binding to protein was detected: 250 picomoles pentachlorophenol, 17 picomoles tetrachlorohydroquinone and 11 picomoles covalent binding in a incubation containing 50 mmol HCB. At low oxygen concentrations, only very small amounts of pentachlorophenol and covalent binding were detected. Incubations with pentachlorophenol at low concentrations showed a conversion dependent covalent binding to the extent of 75 picomoles/nmol pentachlorophenol; the major product of microsomal oxidation pentachlorophenol was tetrachlorohydroquinone which was in redox equilibrium with the corresponding semiquinone and the quinone, chloranil. Covalent binding was inhibited by addition of ascorbic acid or glutathione. Ascorbic acid reduced covalent binding with a simultaneous increase in formation of tetrachlorohydroquinone which was not seen with glutathione. Instead glutathione reacted with chloranil, producing at least three stable products."

Hepatocytes were isolated from male and female F344/N rats pretreated with phenobarbital sodium. These were incubated with (14)carbon labeled or unlabeled HCB, pentachlorobenzene, or pentachlorophenol for 20 hr. Aliquots of the incubation mixture were taken at various times and the extent of metabolism was determined. At the end of the incubation period, the mixtures were analyzed for metabolites. The extent of covalent binding to cellular protein and DNA was determined. Pentachlorobenzene was metabolized at a much faster rate than HCB, 4.5 percent being metabolized by male hepatocytes in 2.5 hr. Pentachlorophenol and pentachlorothiophenol were the major metabolites found in both cases. Pentachlorophenol was converted to tetrachloro-1,4-benzene-diol at a much faster rate than HCB, with 6.2% being metabolized in 2.5 hr. The diol was not found after 20 hr. Hepatocytes from male rats showed greater covalent binding of HCB derived radioactivity to protein than females, 19 and 12 picomoles per 1x10+6 cells, respectively. Maximum binding of radioactivity to DNA amounted to less than 9.9x10-5% of added substrate in both males and females."

The same enzyme is involved in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylation of both isomeric series I and III and catalyses the four steps in both cases. HCB affects all of them. HCB blocks the four steps of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylation to the same degree, as a function of intoxication time. HCB leads, in general, to an increase in the efficiency (Km/Vmax) of the porphyric system."

The in vitro mitochondrial porphyrin accumulation processes have been studied in mitochondria from iron loaded rats. It has been found that under these conditions the active porphyrin uptake process, which is driven by the potassium ion transmembrane gradient, is maximally inhibited in the presence of pentachlorophenol at a concentration similar to that found in vivo in the hexachlorobenzene experimental prophyria. By contrast, the same degree of inhibition is presented by control mitochondria only in the presence of pentachlorophenol plus valinomycin, a condition which collapses the transmembrane potassium ion gradient. A strict correlation between porphyrin uptake and potassium ion concentration has been found in control as well as in iron treated mitochondria."

            "Value": "The metabolism of steroids in hepatic porphyria is reviewed. It has been observed that persons with hereditary defects in the maintenance of heme concentration are prone to experience impairment in the regulation of heme synthesis on exposure to porphyrogenic agents, such as specific drugs and toxic environmental pollutants. Porphyrogenic agents have been divided into two groups. Those reagents which induce a porphyria only in the presence of an enzyme defect of porphyrin synthesis constitute the first group. There are 26 classes and specific compounds in this group. The second group contains reagents that even in the absence of an enzyme defect in heme synthesis cause porphyria. This group is composed of allyl compounds, polychlorinated aromatic compounds, griseofulvin, and lead ions. For a porphyria to occur delta-aminolevulinic acid must be induced and one or more enzyme activities at specific heme synthesis locations must decrease. Research has shown that hexachlorobenzene (HCB) induces porphyria and causes a decrease in the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Studies have shown that in rats with HCB induced porphyria the metabolism of testosterone is changed; a dicarbonyl metabolite accumulates in the liver cells; 5-alpha-reductase activity decreases; and 5-beta-reductase activity increases before stabilizing on the 20th day after the initiation of HCB treatment. Several other observations have indicated that steroid metabolism and induction of porphyria are closely related. Reagents related to HCB and allyl group containing compounds that do not induce porphyria elicit no changes in steroid metabolism."
