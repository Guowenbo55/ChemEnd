No degradation of dimethyl sulfide occurred in sterilized (heat killed - 70 \u00b0C, 1 hr) samples of sediment(2). Addition of dimethyl sulfide to various anoxic aquatic sediments (e.g. fresh water, estuarine, alkaline/hypersaline) stimulated methane production(3). The yield of methane from dimethyl sulfide typically ranged between 52-63%, although high concns of dimethyl sulfide inhibited methanogenesis in sediment from alkaline lakes(3). Metabolism resulted in appearance of methanethiol as a transient intermediate(3). Dimethyl sulfide was completely biodegraded in anoxic salt marsh sediments within 11 days with the production of methanethiol and methane(4). Biological consumption rates of dimethyl sulfide, in seawater samples collected in the eastern Pacific Ocean, ranged from 1.1 nM/day to 18.0 nM/day, giving turnover times of 0.6 to 4.6 days(5). The conversion efficiency from added dimethyl sulfide to methane of an algal mat and sediments obtained from a hypersaline pond was 11.2%(6)."

Higher doses of DMSO are inhibitory to mitochondrial respiration. DMSO has, however, no uncoupling action on oxidative phosphorylation in vitro. Dimethyl sulfide, a known metabolite of DMSO, brings about the uncoupling effect in vitro. The uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by normal mitochondria could also be achieved if these are preincubated with postmitochondrial liver supernatant derived from rat injected with DMSO, 2-24 hr prior to sacrifice. These results provide an explanation for the observed uncoupling effect exerted by DMSO in vivo."

Dimethyl-sulfide irritated the mucous membranes, as well as paralyzing the voluntary and respiratory muscles, with a 15 minute exposure at 5 percent by volume causing death. Dimethyl-disulfide produced a higher degree of local irritation than dimethyl-sulfide, resulting in convulsions and macroscopically visible ecchymoses in the lungs. Paralysis of locomotion and external respiration occurred, with a 15 minute exposure at 0.5 percent by volume causing death. Methyl-mercaptan resulted in the more or less pronounced paralysis of locomotion of respiration, with signs of local irritation being found in the lungs at autopsy. Exposure to methyl-mercaptan for a period of 15 minutes at a concentration of 0.5 percent by volume caused death.

Compounds containing methyl groups had little or no effect. Compounds with two propyl groups or two allyl groups provoked a pleiotropic response on drug-metabolizing enzymes.

These modifications of enzyme activities were accompanied by an increase of CYP 2B1,2 and a decrease of CYP 2E1, evidenced by immunoblotting. The same treatments stimulated some phase II enzyme activities such as glutathione transferase and UDP-glucuronyl transferases.
