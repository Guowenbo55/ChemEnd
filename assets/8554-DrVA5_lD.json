            "Value": "According to Table S1, DAP, DBP, BBP and DEHP were selected. DIBP could be used as a substitute for DBP due to their similarities, and it was also included. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were excluded because of their poor recoveries by the proposed method in this study. The chemical structures and physicochemical properties of the five PAEs are shown in Table S2."
