Among of SA analogues, acetylsalicylic acid, salicylaldehyde, salicyl-alcohol, methyl salicylate and SA evoked a hypocalcemia in rats and mice but the other analogues had no effect by their single administration. The additional administration of dihydroxybenzoic acids elicited the hypocalcemia following the fetal toxicities induced by SA analogues paralleled to that of their hypocalcemic effect. A hypocalcemic effect was induced only by the benzoic acids with hydroxy group existing in ortho-position."
