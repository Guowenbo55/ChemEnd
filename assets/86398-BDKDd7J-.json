It also examined the behavior of these pesticides during thermal processes ranging from 40\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C in two apple varieties. Gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed for analytical investigations. Variations in pesticide concentrations between the pulp and skin were observed depending on the apple variety. Pirimicarb showed the highest transfer to the pulp, while boscalid and deltamethrin remained predominantly on the skin. Surprisingly, boscalid was found to be more present in the apple skin than in the pulp. Drying and dry pasteurization processes were the most effective in reducing pesticide levels in apples with and without skin, respectively. Thermal processes resulted in processing factors ranging from 0.06 to 0.98 for ten pesticides, with acetamiprid being the only pesticide whose levels were not decreased. The study discussed the relationship between pesticide distribution, behavior, and physico-chemical properties, particularly water solubility. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pesticide efficacy and removal in apples.",

To enhance the chemical control of BRRD and prevent the emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study examined the control efficacy and systemic activity of fungicides with various modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with different modes of action were tested for their inhibitory effects on 39 P. noxius isolates from multiple regions. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (target-site G1) exhibited colony growth inhibition of P. noxius by 99.9% to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7% to 99.8% at 1 ppm. Another effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings, with cyproconazole and tebuconazole being the most efficiently absorbed by roots and transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments indicated that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD compared to mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Since all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered over trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.",

This study investigated the uptake, translocation, and residue dissipation of typical fungicides (metalaxyl-M and fludioxonil) and insecticides (cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam) in greenhouse chrysanthemum when applied to soils. Chrysanthemum plants absorbed these pesticides from soils to various degrees, with bioconcentration factors (BCF) positively correlated with the lipophilicity (log Kow) of pesticides. The highly lipophilic fludioxonil (log Kow = 4.12) had the greatest BCF (2.96 \u00b1 0.41 g/g), while the hydrophilic thiamethoxam (log Kow = 0.13) had the lowest (0.09 \u00b1 0.03 g/g). Translocation factors (TF) from roots to shoots followed the order of TF_leaf > TF_stem > TF_flower. Metalaxyl-M and cyantraniliprole, with medium lipophilicity (log Kow of 1.71 and 2.02, respectively), and hydrophilic thiamethoxam showed relatively strong translocation potentials with TF values in the range of 0.29\u20130.81, 0.36\u20132.74, and 0.30\u20131.03, respectively.",
