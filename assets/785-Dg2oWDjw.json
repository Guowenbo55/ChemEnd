Benzene metabolites hydroquinone (HQ) and benzoquinone (BQ) are highly reactive molecules capable of producing reactive oxygen species and causing oxidative stress. /This study/ investigated the role of the Nrf2, a key nuclear transcription factor that regulates antioxidant response element (ARE)-containing genes, in defense against HQ- and BQ-induced cytotoxicity in cultured human lung epithelial cells (Beas-2B). When the cells were exposed to HQ or BQ the activity of an ARE reporter was induced in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile Nrf2 protein levels were elevated and accumulated in the nucleus. Increased expression of well-known Nrf2-dependent proteins including NQO1, GCLM, GSS and HMOX was also observed in the HQ/BQ-treated cells. Moreover, transient overexpression of Nrf2 conferred protection against HQ- and BQ-induced cell death, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA resulted in increased apoptosis. /This study/ also found that the increased susceptibility of Nrf2-knockdown cells to HQ and BQ was associated with reduced glutathione levels and loss of inducibility of ARE-driven genes, suggesting that deficiency of Nrf2 impairs cellular redox capacity to counteract oxidative damage. Altogether, these results suggest that Nrf2-ARE pathway is essential for protection against HQ- and BQ-induced toxicity."

The effect of hydroquinone and /its metabolite/ 2,3,5-(tris-glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone, on site-selective cytotoxicity and cell proliferation in rat kidney /is described/. Male Fischer 344 rats (160-200 g) were treated with hydroquinone (1.8 mmol/kg or 4.5 mmol/kg, po) or 2,3,5-(tris-glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (7.5 umol/kg; 1.2-1.5 uol/rat, iv), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glucose were measured as indices of nephrotoxicity. Hydroquinone (1.8 mmol/kg, po) is nephrotoxic in some rats, but not others, but cell proliferation (BrDU incorporation) in proximal tubular cells of the S3M region correlates with the degree of toxicity in individual rats. At 4.5 mmol/kg, hydroquinone causes significant increases in the urinary excretion of gamma-GT, ALP and GST. Pretreatment of rats with acivicin prevents hydroquinone-mediated nephrotoxicity, indicating that toxicity is dependent on the formation of metabolites that require processing by gamma-GT. Consistent with this view, 2,3,5-(tris-glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone, a metabolite of hydroquinone, causes increases in BUN, urinary gamma-GT and ALP, all of which are maximal 12 hr after administration of 2,3,5-(tris-glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone. In contrast, the maximal excretion of GST and glucose occurs after 24 h. By 72 h, BUN and glucose concentrations return to control levels, while gamma-GT, ALP and GST remain slightly elevated. Examination of kidney slices by light microscopy revealed the presence of tubular necrosis in the S3M segment of the proximal tubule, extending into the medullary rays. Cell proliferation rates in this region were 2.4, 6.9, 15.3 and 14.3% after 12, 24, 48 and 72 hr, respectively, compared to 0.8-2.4% in vehicle controls.

In this study, the effects of exposure to low doses of HQ on neutrophil mobilization into the LPS-inflamed lung were investigated. Male Swiss mice were exposed to aerosolized vehicle (control) or 12.5, 25 or 50 ppm HQ (1 hr/day for 5 days). One hour later, oxidative burst, cell cycle, DNA fragmentation and adhesion molecules expressions in circulating neutrophils were determined by flow cytometry, and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by HPLC. Also, 1 hr later the last exposures, inflammation was induced by LPS inhalation (0.1 mg/mL/10 min) and 3 hr later, the numbers of leukocytes in peripheral blood and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined using a Neubauer chamber and stained smears; adhesion molecules expressed on lung microvessel endothelial cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry; myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured in the lung tissue by colorimetric assay; and cytokines in the BALF were determined by ELISA. In vivo HQ exposure augmented plasma MDA levels and oxidative activity of neutrophils, but did not cause alterations in cell cycle and DNA fragmentation. Under these conditions, the number of circulating leukocytes was not altered, but HQ exposure reduced LPS-induced neutrophil migration into the alveolar space, as these cells remained in the lung tissue. The impaired neutrophil migration into BALF may not be dependent on reduced cytokines secretions in the BALF and lung endothelial adhesion molecules expressions. However, HQ exposure increased the expression of beta(2) and beta(3) integrins and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in neutrophils, which were not further enhanced by fMLP in vitro stimulation, indicating that HQ exposure activates circulating neutrophils, impairing further stimulatory responses. Therefore, it has been shown, ... that neutrophils are target of lower levels of in vivo HQ exposure, which may be considered in host defense in infectious diseases."

Female F344 rats B6C3F1 mice and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are resistant to the chronic renal toxicity of hydroquinone and nephrotoxicity was not seen in dogs or humans following subchronic exposure. To characterize the early development of renal toxicity in rats cell proliferation was quantitated within the proximal (P1, P2, and P3) and distal tubule segments of the kidney in rats given 0, 2.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg hydroquinone by gavage. Male and female F344 rats were treated for 1, 3, or 6 wk and male SD rats were treated for 6 wk. Cell proliferation was quantitated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine detected immunohistochemically, into newly synthesized DNA. At 6 wk renal cell proliferation was increased over vehicle-controls in male F344 rats dosed at 50 mg/kg. Significant elevations (p < 0.001) occurred in the P1 segments (87%) and in the P2 segments (50%) but the elevation in the P3 segment (34%) was not statistically significant. Urinalyses revealed increases in the rate of excretion of enzymes indicative of proximal tubular damage. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was consistent with a dose-related tubular degeneration in the male F344 rat. No chemical-related effects were observed in the kidneys of female F344 and male SD rats. These data parallel the findings of sex- and strain-specific kidney adenomas in the 2 yr bioassays and suggest that chemically induced cell proliferation secondary to toxicity may be important in the pathogenesis of benign renal tumors in male F344 rats treated with hydroquinone."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ Hydroquinone (HQ) is a potential human carcinogen to which many people are exposed. HQ generally tests negative in standard mutagenicity assays, making it a \"nongenotoxic\" carcinogen whose mechanism of action remains unknown. HQ is metabolized to 2,3,5-tris(glutathion-S-yl)HQ (TGHQ), a potent toxic and redox active compound. To determine if TGHQ is a carcinogen in the kidney, TGHQ was administered to Eker rats (2 months of age) for 4 or 10 months. Eker rats carry a germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc-2) tumor suppressor gene, which makes them highly susceptible to the development of renal tumors. As early as 4 months after the initiation of treatment (2.5 umol/kg, i.p.), TGHQ-treated rats developed numerous toxic tubular dysplasias of a form rarely present in vehicle-treated rats. These preneoplastic lesions are believed to represent early transformation within tubules undergoing regeneration after injury by TGHQ, and adenomas subsequently arose within these lesions. After treatment for 10 months (2.5 umol/kg for 4 months followed by 3.5 micromol/kg for 6 months), there were 6-, 7-, and 10-fold more basophilic dysplasias, adenomas, and renal cell carcinomas, respectively, in TGHQ-treated animals than in controls. Most of these lesions were in the region of TGHQ-induced acute renal injury, the outer stripe of the outer medulla. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Tsc-2 locus was demonstrated in both the toxic tubular dysplasias and tumors from rats treated with TGHQ for 10 months, consistent with TGHQ-induced loss of tumor suppressor function of the Tsc-2 gene. Thus, although HQ is generally considered a nongenotoxic carcinogen, /these/ data suggest that HQ nephrocarcinogenesis is probably mediated by the formation of the quantitatively minor yet potent nephrotoxic metabolite TGHQ, which induces sustained regenerative hyperplasia, loss of tumor suppressor gene function, and the subsequent formation of renal adenomas and carcinomas..."

At the end of the study (13 weeks), DNA adducts ((32)P-postlabeling), cell proliferation (PCNA immunohistochemistry) and preneoplastic hepatocellular altered foci (HAF) (glutathione S-transferase-placental type immuno-histochemistry) were measured. No significant differences were observed in body weight gains or liver weights. AAF produced liver DNA adducts and at the low dose of HQ adduct levels were 90% of that for AAF alone, whereas at the high dose adducts were reduced by 33% (p<0.05). AAF exposure yielded about a 50% increase in hepatocellular proliferation and both HQ doses reduced the AAF-induced increases in proliferation by about 25%.

Through an independent review of the renal histopathology from the NTP study, the grade of CPN and the presence of atypical tubule hyperplasia and adenomas was evaluated. Hydroquinone exposure in males at 50 mg/kg, produced a statistically significant increase in the grade of CPN. At 0, 25, and 50 mg/kg, 0/44, 4/49, and 15/51 male rats had either atypical tubule hyperplasias or adenomas; all were within areas of severe or end-stage CPN and were statistically significantly associated with CPN grade. Additionally, there was a dose-related increase in profiles believed to represent new tubule proliferation within areas of advanced CPN, as well as an apparent expansion of these into unusual complex tubule profiles in end-stage kidneys of the high-dose male group. In summary, this histopathological review suggest a mechanism for hydroquinone-related adenoma formation that includes enhancement of the severity of CPN coupled with stimulation of tubule proliferation."

Increased frequencies of CREST-positive micronuclei (indicating chromosone loss) and CREST-negative micronuclei (indicating chromosome breakage) were observed following exposure of cells to HQ hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone. The formation of micronuclei by hydroquinone, but not tert-butyl-hydroquinone, was dependent on arachidonic acid supplementation, indicating activation by prostaglandin H synthase. Since the oxidation of hydroquinones can result in the generation of oxygen radicals, the contribution of oxygen radicals to the formation of chromosomal alterations induced by hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone was investigated. In the presence of a superoxide-generating system consisting of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, a significant increase in micronucleated cells was observed. These induced micronuclei consisted exclusively of CREST-negative micronuclei and their formation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with catalase. Catalase also significantly inhibited the CREST-negative micronuclel induced by hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone. In addition, glutathione treatment inhibited both CREST-positive and negative micronuclei induced by these phenolic compounds. ... Both chromosome loss and breakage are induced by these two quinone-forming agents. Reactive oxygen species contribute to the chromosomal breakage induced by hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone but the observed chromosomal loss appears to result from other mechanisms such as an interference of quinone metabolites with spindle formation."

A pronounced difference in the results was observed using the two approaches: 63% of the micronuclei induced by hydroquinone labeled with the major satellite probe whereas only 25% labeled with the CREST antibody. To determine whether the observed difference was due to a disruption of the kinetochore or a result of breakage within centromeric heterochromatin, we developed a tandem label multicolor hybridization assay which requires the presence of both the mouse major and minor satellite probes in a micronucleus for a classification of chromosomal loss. The minor probe targets a centromeric region physically linked to the short arm of mouse chromosomes whereas the major probe hybridizes to the centromeric heterochromatin adjacent to the long arm.

These results are consistent with other studies, which suggest metabolite differences in benzene-mediated toxicity. More importantly, this study supports the hypothesis that benzene may mediate its toxicity through ROS-mediated alterations in the c-Myb signaling pathway."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ BACKGROUND: Benzene is an established human leukemogen, with a ubiquitous environmental presence leading to significant population exposure. In a genome-wide functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of IRA2, a yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor gene NF1 (Neurofibromin), enhanced sensitivity to hydroquinone, an important benzene metabolite. Increased Ras signaling is implicated as a causal factor in the increased pre-disposition to leukemia of individuals with mutations in NF1.  METHODS: Growth inhibition of yeast by hydroquinone was assessed in mutant strains exhibiting varying levels of Ras activity. Subsequently, effects of hydroquinone on both genotoxicity (measured by micronucleus formation) and proliferation of WT and Nf1 null murine hematopoietic precursors were assessed.  RESULTS: /This study shows/ that the Ras status of both yeast and mammalian cells modulates hydroquinone toxicity, indicating potential synergy between Ras signaling and benzene toxicity. Specifically, enhanced Ras signaling increases both hydroquinone-mediated growth inhibition in yeast and genotoxicity in mammalian hematopoetic precursors as measured by an in vitro erythroid micronucleus assay. Hydroquinone also increases proliferation of CFU-GM progenitor cells in mice with Nf1 null bone marrow relative to WT, the same cell type associated with benzene-associated leukemia.  CONCLUSIONS: Together /these/ findings show that hydroquinone toxicity is modulated by Ras signaling. Individuals with abnormal Ras signaling could be more vulnerable to developing myeloid diseases after exposure to benzene. /This study notes/ that hydroquinone is used cosmetically as a skin-bleaching agent, including by individuals with cafe-au-lait spots (which may be present in individuals with neurofibromatosis who have a mutation in NF1), which could be unadvisable given /these/ findings."

Downregulation of Fau by overexpression of its reverse sequence has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents. To address a potential role of Fau in benzene toxicity, we investigated the apoptotic effects of hydroquinone (HQ), a major benzene metabolite, in W7.2 mouse thymoma cells transfected with either a plasmid construct expressing the antisense sequence of Fau (rfau) or the empty vector (pcDNA3.1) as a control. HQ induced apoptosis via increased production of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage, measured using dihydroethidine (HE) staining and alkaline Comet assay, respectively, in W7.2 pcDNA3.1 cells. In contrast, when Fau was downregulated by the antisense sequence in W7.2 rfau cells, HQ treatment did not cause DNA damage and oxidative stress and these cells were markedly more resistant to HQ-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that there was an upregulation of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxification enzyme for benzene-derived quinones, in W7.2 rfau cells. Compromising cellular NQO1 by use of a specific mechanism-based inhibitor (MAC 220) and NQO1 siRNA resensitized W7.2 rfau cells to HQ-induced apoptosis. Silencing of Fau in W7.2 wild-type cells resulted in increased levels of NQO1, confirming that downregulation of Fau results in NQO1 upregulation which protects against HQ-induced apoptosis."

Glutathione conjugation of HQ enhances its biological reactivity, and 2,3,5-tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ) is a potent nephrotoxicant and nephrocarcinogen in the Eker rat. Moreover, a single exposure of primary epithelial cells derived from Eker rat kidneys to TGHQ transforms these cells into an immortalized phenotype (quinol-thioether transformed rat renal epithelial (QT-RRE) cells). The Eker rat bears a mutation in one allele of the tuberous sclerosis-2 (Tsc-2) tumor suppressor gene, which predisposes the animals to the development of spontaneous and chemical-induced renal cell carcinoma. Thus, the Eker rat provides a unique model for elucidating the mechanisms of renal tubular epithelial carcinogeneisis. cDNA microarray analysis of QT-RRE3 cells and of tumor tissue derived from the kidneys of Eker rats treated with TGHQ revealed alterations (by threefold or greater) in the expression of a total of 80 genes. Fifteen percent of these genes exhibited similar expression patterns in both QT-RRE cells and tumor tissue. The differentially expressed genes primarily participate in three major areas: (1) signal transduction or in the regulation of signal transduction (extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2); protein kinase CK2; protein kinase B; c-jun; NF-kappaB; ras-related GTPases; annexins), (2) stress response, tissue remodeling, and DNA repair (glutathione-S-transferases; procollagen c proteinase enhancer; plasminogen activator; tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 3; apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease), and (3) electron transport and energy homeostasis (cytochrome c oxidase subunits). The changes in the expression of many of these genes was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using primers specific for the differentially expressed genes. As an example, the annexin I and II genes, implicated in signal transduction, were highly induced in tumor tissue and also in dysplastic lesions isolated from the kidneys of rats treated chronically with TGHQ.

For all genders and strains of rats and for all treatment regimens, mono-adducts predominated in livers (>72% of total). In the kidneys, tri- and tetrasubstituted adducts predominated with the summation accounting for >60% of the total. Ip administration of HQ resulted in significantly elevated levels of adducts in all the tissues that were examined, with the greatest increases seen for protein from blood and spleens. Levels of protein-S adducts of HQ in rat kidney following a single gavage administration correlated well with previously published differences in acute HQ nephrotoxicity in rats (female F-344 rat > male F-344 rat > male SD rat). Elevated levels of HQ protein-S adducts following repeated gavage administration did not correlate to measurable clinical signs of nephrotoxicity. Evidence is presented suggesting a possible role for the prostaglandin H synthase complex in the metabolic activation of HQ. In addition, protein arylation alone cannot account for the greater sensitivity of male F-344 rats toward chronic administration of HQ. The sensitivity of male F-344 rats to HQ is likely due to other factors, including the incidence and severity of chronic progressive nephropathy."
