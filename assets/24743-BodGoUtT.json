    "Description": "Desmedipham is a carbamate ester that is phenylcarbamic acid in which the hydrogen of the hydroxy group has been replaced by a 3-[(ethoxycarbonyl)amino]phenyl group. It is an agrochemical used as a herbicide. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is functionally related to a phenylcarbamic acid.",

            "content": "The selectivity of phenmedipham and desmedipham on wild mustard, redroot pigweed, and sugar beet was investigated by examining spray retention, absorption, translocation, and metabolism. Wild mustard showed severe inhibition of total photosynthesis within 5 hours of herbicide application, with no recovery, while sugar beet exhibited slight inhibition but recovered after 24 hours. Redroot pigweed recovered from phenmedipham treatment but not from desmedipham treatment. Differences in spray retention or foliar absorption did not explain selectivity. Redroot pigweed translocated more desmedipham than phenmedipham and metabolized more phenmedipham than desmedipham within 5 hours of application. The initial detoxication reaction of the parent compound appeared to be the key factor explaining selectivity.",

They were grown at 20\u00b0C, 24-27 klux light intensity with 16 hr daylength prior to treatment.
