            "Value": "Most of the plutonium found in field grown native plants and agricultural crops is due to surface contamination rather than soil plant transfer. Plutonium concn depends on plant species, on the type and age and status of vegetation; on the pH; cation exchange capacity; mineral and organic composition of the soil; and on the physical and chemical form of contamination; as well as its duration. The highest uptake of plutonium in cheat grass occurs, for example, when plutonium is present in the soil as the stable citrate complex or as a complex with macromolecules, like humic acid or fulvic acid."
