    "Description": "Nitroglycerin is a nitroglycerol that is glycerol in which the hydrogen atoms of all three hydroxy groups are replaced by nitro groups. It acts as a prodrug, releasing nitric oxide to open blood vessels and so alleviate heart pain. It has a role as a vasodilator agent, a nitric oxide donor, an explosive, a prodrug, a tocolytic agent, a muscle relaxant and a xenobiotic.",

            "Value": "Nitroglycerin and other aliphatic nitric acid esters undergo aerobic biodegradation readily via successive removal of nitrate groups to isomeric derivatives(1). Contrary to some earlier reports that it was recalcitrant to biodegradation, nitroglycerin proved to be readily biodegradable in batch and continuous tests(2). Results of the shake flask test that was run at 30 \u00b0C with an activated sludge inoculum showed a 53.6% loss of nitroglycerin in 5 days(2). In a continuous bench-scale activated sludge apparatus, a mean reduction of 92.2% was obtained(2). The apparatus was run at room temperature and the residence time was 84 hr. 1,3-Dinitroglycerol and 1,2-dinitroglycerol were identified at intermediate stages of the process, but they were also essentially absent from the effluent(2). The third experiment employing a chemostat, a continuous culture, aerobic system with no solids recycling, was designed to simulate a plant where propellant wastes would be treated. After a 8-15 hr detention period, no nitrate esters were detectable in the effluent(2). It was found that nitroglycerin is not suitable as a source of carbon and nitrogen so nutrients are essential(2). It was speculated that the earlier experiments which showed nitroglycerin to be recalcitrant were conducted using concns of nitroglycerin that were toxic to the microorganisms(2)."

Without glucose amendments, the complete mineralization of nitroglycerin took about 25 days in the digester(1). Nitroglycerin, present at 16 mg/l, was rapidly degraded in a sequencing batch reactor using mixed liquor from an industrial wastewater facility and a domestic wastewater treatment plant, with 1,2-dinitroglycerol and 1,3-dinitroglycerol as the initial products(2)."

            "Value": "Although it predominately affects vascular smooth muscle /nitroglycerin/, the bronchioles, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system), ureters, and uterus are affected. Free radicals of nitric oxide may activate guanylate cyclase, resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic GMP. Nitric oxide may combine with sulfhydryl groups in the endothelium and produce S-nitrosothiols, which stimulate guanylate cyclase production. N-acetyl-cycteine may enhance this process by providing a source of sulfhydryl groups. Cyclic GMP appears to reduce stored calcium and interfere with calcium-activated smooth muscle contractions."

Phosphorylation of the myosin chain regulates the maintenance of the contractile state in smooth muscle."

            "Value": "Nitrates also may alter the prostaglandin system by inhibiting thromboxane synthetase and permitting preferential formation of prostacyclin over thromboxane A2. Both of these two short-acting vasoactive substances are formed from prostaglandin precursors. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator which causes smooth muscle relaxation through phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase. This reduces its ability to to be activated by calciun and calmodulin."
