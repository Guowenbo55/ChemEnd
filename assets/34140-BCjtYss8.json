Bis(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ether was not detected (detection limit <5 pg/g) in salmon caught in the Central Gulf of Bothnia in 1986 and in the Baltic Sea near Gothland in 1986, but was detected in salmon caught in the Gulf of Finland in 1987 at 0.005 to 0.013 ng/g(3). Bis(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ether was not detected (detection limit <5 pg/g) in cod liver fat; cod were caught at the Arctic Coast of Norway in 1987 and 1988(3). Bis(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ether was detected in pike and lake bream sampled from the Kymijoki River, Finland at 9-12 and 10 pg/g fresh weight, respectively; sample dates were not provided(4). Pike, sampled from the Kymijoki River, Finland were found to contain <7 ng/g lipid weight of bis(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ether, samples were collected in 1993(5)."

GC-MS analyses indicated the mean total CDPE concentrations were 4, 16, 57, and 126 ug/kg in whole fish from Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, respectively. The number of known and unidentified congeners detected above the 0.4-mug/kg detection limit ranged from six to 24 congeners among the lakes, and this number increased with the total concentration of CDPEs. The Cl6 homologue represented 46 to 61% of total CDPEs in Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario, and the Cl5, Cl6, and Cl7 homologues represented 78 to 93% of total CDPE concentrations."

In addition to salmon, one chlorophenol wood preservative (Ky-5) and one fly ash sample were analyzed for PCDEs. Concentrations of PCDE congeners in salmon muscle measured by high resolution gas chromatography/low resolution mass spectrometry ranged from <0.02 to 2.4 ng/g fresh weight. The major components of tetra- to octachlorinated PCDEs in salmon were one TeCDE (22'44'-), two PeCDEs (22'44'5- and 23'44'5-) and three HxCDEs (22'44'56'-, 22'44'55'- and 22'344'5-). The Baltic salmon caught from the Simojoki River had higher levels of PCDEs than the Atlantic salmon from the Tenojoki River or salmon from Lake Saimaa in South-Finland. Same PCDE congeners which were abundant in the wood preservative were also detected in salmon, whereas PCDE congeners in the fly ash were different from those in salmon or in Ky-5."

The nontoxicity of the polychlorinated diphenyl ethers /such as bis(2,4-dichlorophenyl) ether/ compared to polychlorinated biphenyls has been explained by the non-planarity of the diphenyl ethers. Thus they do not fit into the rectangular (3 x 10 angstrom) dioxin receptor as do the toxic biphenyls..."
