            "Value": "It has been reported that sorbitol induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. ... In /this/ study, the intracellular signaling pathways of sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells were investigated using both morphological analysis and DNA fragmentation technique. In this study, we demonstrated that sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells is a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This sorbitol-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells was also accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, and down-regulation of p-Bcl-2, but no effect on the levels of Bcl-X(L). Moreover, the sorbitol treatment resulted in a significant reduction of mitochondria membrane potential, increase in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c), and activation of caspase 3. Furthermore, treatment with caspase 3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) was capable of preventing the sorbitol-induced caspase 3 activity and cell death. These results clearly demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by sorbitol involves multiple cellular/molecular pathways and strongly suggest that pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial cyt c, and caspase 3, they all participate in sorbitol-induced apoptotic process in human K562 cells."

            "Value": "Chronic diabetic complications, in particular, nephropathy, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, \"diabetic foot,\" retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease, remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Growing evidence indicates that both increased activity of the sorbitol pathway of glucose metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress are the leading factors in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The relation between the two mechanisms remains the area of controversy. One group has reported that increased sorbitol pathway activity has a protective rather than detrimental role in complication-prone tissues because the pathway detoxifies toxic lipid peroxidation products. Others put forward a so-called \"unifying hypothesis\" suggesting that activation of several major pathways implicated in diabetic complications (eg, sorbitol pathway) occurs due to increased production of superoxide anion radicals in mitochondria and resulting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. This review (a) presents findings supporting a key role for the sorbitol pathway in oxidative stress and oxidative stress-initiated downstream mechanisms of diabetic complications, and (b) summarizes experimental evidence against a detoxifying role of the sorbitol pathway, as well as the \"unifying concept.\""

To investigate the influence of thyroid hormone on the sorbitol pathway, ... rats were divided into three groups: controls, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic euthyroid rats (DM) and STZ-induced diabetic hyperthyroid (thyroxine-injected) rats (DM+HT). The sorbitol (Sor) concentrations in the kidney, liver and sciatic nerve (2.53+/-0.74, 0.97+/-0.16 and 24.0+/-5.1 nmol/mg protein, respectively) of the DM rats were significantly higher than those (1.48+/-0.31, 0.58+/-0.13 and 3. 1+/-0.6 nmol/mg protein) of the control rats. The Sor concentrations in the kidney and sciatic nerve of the DM+HT rats (1.26+/-0.29 and 9. 40+/-1.2 nmol/mg protein) were significantly lower than those in the DM rats. These values were reduced in the liver, unchanged in the kidney, and increased in the sciatic nerve from the hyperthyroid rats without diabetes. Thyroid hormone reduced the aldose reductase (AR) activities in the kidney, liver and sciatic nerve of the DM rats, and similarly reduced AR in the kidney and liver, but not in the sciatic nerve, of the non-diabetic rats. The sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activities were decreased by thyroid hormone in the kidney and liver but not the sciatic nerve of DM rats. In the non-diabetic rats, this enzyme activity was decreased in liver, but not in kidney or sciatic nerve. A positive correlation between the Sor concentration and AR activity was observed in the kidney and liver but not in the sciatic nerve from control, DM and DM+HT rats. A negative correlation was observed between the Sor concentration and SDH activities in the same organs. These data suggest that thyroid hormone affects the sorbitol pathway, but the detailed mechanism whereby this hormone reduces the sorbitol content (especially in diabetic rats) remains to be clarified."

At the completion of the treatments, all rats were trained in the radial-arm water maze, a spatial (hippocampus-dependent) learning and memory task. Three groups of rats were tested: an untreated control group, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) group, and an intermittent hypoglycemic group. Following behavioral training, the brains of all animals were examined with histologic and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: Peripheral hyperglycemia was associated with significant increases in brain sorbitol (7.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.84 +/- 1.0 uM/mg) and inositol (9.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 7.1 +/- 1.1 uM/mg) and reduced taurine (0.65 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 mg/mg). Histologic evaluation revealed neurons with reduced dendritic branching and spine density in STZ-D rats but not in control or hypoglycemic animals. In addition, the STZ-D group exhibited impaired performance on the water maze memory test. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia, but not hypoglycemia, was associated with adverse effects on the brain polyol pathway activity, neuronal structural changes, and impaired long-term spatial memory. This finding suggests that the hyperglycemic component of diabetes mellitus has a greater adverse effect on brain functioning than does intermittent hypoglycemia. ."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Complications common to type I diabetes, such as cataracts and cardiovascular disorders, have been associated with activation of the polyol pathway, which converts glucose to fructose via the intermediate, sorbitol. Under normal glycemic conditions, glucose is typically targeted for glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway through phosphorylation by hexokinase. When glucose levels are elevated under diabetic conditions, hexokinase becomes saturated, and the excess glucose is then shunted to aldose reductase, which converts glucose to sorbitol. In the present study, we examined the potential effects of this pathway on the maturation process in mouse oocytes. Increasing concentrations of sorbitol suppressed FSH-induced maturation in oocytes from control mice. Culturing oocytes from diabetic mice in the presence of inhibitors of aldose reductase reversed the suppression of FSH-induced meiotic maturation. When oocytes from control mice were cultured with activators of aldose reductase, FSH-induced maturation was compromised. In addition, treatment with sorbitol or activators of the polyol pathway led to reduced cell-cell communication between the oocyte and the cumulus cells, as well as compromised FSH-mediated cAMP production and de novo purine synthesis. These data indicate that the suppression of FSH-induced meiotic maturation observed in oocytes from diabetic mice may result from a shunting of glucose through the polyol pathway."

Sorbitol, rather than sucrose, was identified as the main carbohydrate involved in phloem transport in intact apple plants. When excised phloem, both freshly excised and aged, was studied, sorbitol, glucose, and sucrose were rapidly accumulated, with sorbitol showing higher accumulation rates, especially in concentrated solutions and aged tissues. Notably, sorbitol was preferentially accumulated into the phloem, remaining inert metabolically until reaching its destination. Sorbitol's accumulation was more pronounced in comparison to sucrose or glucose. This study provides insights into sorbitol's significant role in phloem translocation within apple plants, highlighting its suitability for efficient and stable carbohydrate transport in agricultural contexts.
