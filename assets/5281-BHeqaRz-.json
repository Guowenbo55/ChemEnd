    "Description": "Octadecanoic acid is a C18 straight-chain saturated fatty acid component of many animal and vegetable lipids. As well as in the diet, it is used in hardening soaps, softening plastics and in making cosmetics, candles and plastics. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a human metabolite, a Daphnia magna metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acid, a straight-chain saturated fatty acid and a saturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of an octadecanoate. It derives from a hydride of an octadecane.",

Using the Warburg test method, the biodegradation of stearic acid in the presence of an activated sludge inoculum at 20, 25, and 30 \u00b0C was determined to have half-lives of 3.75, 5.55, and 10.7 days, respectively(4). In an aerobic screening test, stearic acid was determined to be 95% degraded in 21 days using a sewage inoculum(5). Using a marine water inoculum, 5 ppm stearic acid was determined to have a theoretical BOD of 43.9% after 5 days(6). In the presence of a sewage inoculum, 39% removal of 0.777 ppm stearic acid occurred at a kraft paper mill lagoon over two days(7).

            "Value": "The Koc for the neutral species of stearic acid is estimated as 5.1X10+4(SRC), using a log Kow of 8.23(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests the neutral (non-ionized) species of stearic acid is expected to be immobile in soil. The estimated pKa of stearic acid is 4.75(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). However, the adsorption of stearate, the anion of stearic acid, was determined using relatively nonpolar marine sediment sand surfaces: in anoxic clastic mud from Cape Lookout Bight, NC (3.5 g/g organic carbon, clay), fine carbonate beach sand from Kahana Stream, Oahu, HI (1.3 g/g organic carbon, fine sand and silty clay), and a fine carbonate sand from Waimanalo Beach, Oahu, HI (0.17 g/g organic carbon, fine-very fine sand), stearate exhibited Kds of 210, 140 and 36, respectively; overall averaging 99% adsorption(6), suggesting that the anionic species will be immobile in soil."
