    "Description": "Microcystin-LR is a microcystin consisting of D-alanyl, L-leucyl, (3S)-3-methyl-D-beta-aspartyl,L-arginyl, 2S,3S,4E,6E,8S,9S)-3-amino-4,5,6,7-tetradehydro-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldecanoyl, D-gamma-glutamyl, and 2,3-didehydro-N-methylalanyl residues joined into a 25-membered macrocycle. Produced by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, it is the most studied of the microcystins. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an EC 3.1.3.16 (phosphoprotein phosphatase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant.",

Samples of fish, consisting of zooplanktivorous, phytoplanktivorous, and omnivorous fish, commonly consumed in Michoacan, Mexico were collected from commercial fishing operations that occurred within the Lago de Patzcuaro in the vicinity of cyanobacterial blooms. Total microcystin concentrations ranged from 4.99 ng/g in the dorsal muscle to 867 ng/g in the viscera/liver(1)."
