Thus, toluene at low concentrations may produce disturbances in dopaminergic mechanisms of the basal ganglia probably leading to functional changes in sensory-motor integration. The increases in DA turnover in the cholecystokinin (CCK)-DA terminals of the subcortical limbic system induced by high concentrations of toluene may be part of the neurochemical basis for its abuse as a euphoric agent in man."

The effects of toluene inhalation on some specific enzymes and glutamate and GABA receptor binding in defined parts of the rat brain were studied following several exposure schemes. The activities of the transmitter synthesizing enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase (AAD) were used as markers for permanent loss of neuronal activity. Catecholaminergic neurons showed a 50% reduction in the brain stem after 4 weeks exposure to 250 and 1000 ppm toluene. Following 500 ppm of toluene, 16 hr/day for 3 months, a general increase in the activities was seen. This is most probably due to a reduction in total protein content, to which the activities were related. The neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA had their specific receptor binding increased in most of the brain areas studied, but decreased in some areas. The glial enzyme, glutamine synthetase, has its activity increased in the cerebellar hemisphere following 4 weeks exposure to 1000 ppm. This suggests that glial cells in the area may have proliferated, a frequent phenomenon following CNS damage."

Inhalation of these vapors can cause euphoria and impairments in motor control and neurological functioning. Misuse and abuse of toluene is most common in children, which may in part be due to an age-dependent neurobehavioral sensitivity to toluene. Here we assessed the effects of acute binge-like toluene inhalations (15 or 30 min; ~5,000 ppm) on tasks that examine locomotion, exploration, balance, gait, and neurological functioning for adolescent (1 month), young adult (2-3 months), adult (5-6 months), and older adult (10-12 months) rats. Both motor and neurological functions were impaired following acute toluene inhalation at all ages. However, only the duration to recover from deficits in motor functions differed among age groups, with adolescent and young adult rats requiring notably longer recovery times than older rats. Our results are suggestive of an age-dependent vulnerability to the intoxicating effects of toluene."

Despite its usefulness, toluene has toxic effects on the brain and is a substance that is commonly abused. Toluene causes behavioral and functional abnormalities such as decreased memory capacity, cognitive impairment, and depression-like symptoms. However, the target sites and toxic mechanisms of inhaled toluene in the brain are poorly understood. In this study, we subjected Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to acute high-level toluene exposure (7000 ppm) to investigate its neuronal toxicity, and in particular, its effect on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In order to assay the effects of inhaled toluene on hippocampal neurogenesis, we measured the levels of neurogenesis markers Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX) in the hippocampus 1, 2, 5, and 8 days after cessation of toluene exposure. In addition to assaying clinical signs, body weight, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the liver, lungs, and kidneys were subjected to histopathological examination to investigate the toxic effects of high-level toluene exposure. Although abnormal neurological signs were observed after toluene exposure, these disappeared within 24 hr and no toluene-related toxicological effects were observed in the liver, lungs, or kidneys. The animals exposed to toluene showed significantly decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, which persisted until the 8th and final day of measurement. Thus, acute high-level toluene exposure inhibited hippocampal neurogenesis and produced transient abnormal neurological signs, but did not produce toxicity in the other organs studied."

We examined the effects of toluene on transcriptomic changes and oxidative stress (OS) parameters (e.g., NQO1 and GPX) in the rat brain at different life stages to elucidate key molecular pathways responsible for toluene-induced neurotoxicity, as well as possible age-related interactions. Changes in assessed end points following acute oral toluene (0, 0.65, and 1.0 g/kg) were examined 4 h after exposure in hippocampi of Brown Norway Rats at 4, 12, and 24 months of age. Genomic data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA to identify the effects of age, toluene, and interactions between the two factors. Analysis by one-way ANOVA identified 183 genes whose expression changed /greater than oe equal to/ 1.25-fold with age. The majority of the genes were upregulated between life stages (> 79%). Similar analysis for toluene-related genes found only two sequences to vary significantly with dose. Fifty-six genes were identified to have expression changes due to an age-toluene interaction. Expression of genes with roles in immune response, cytoskeleton, protein, and energy metabolism was changed with advancing life stage, indicating changes in basic cellular homeostasis. Toluene affected similar cell functions, enhancing the effects of aging. OS parameters also indicated age-related changes in response mechanisms, evidence of toluene damage, and supported an age-toluene interaction. The data indicate that life stage can alter the toxicity of acute toluene exposure in various and complex ways, highlighting the need for further investigation into the role of aging in susceptibility."

The agents proved to be similar in causing muscle weakness and ataxia already at low dose levels. Benzene was the most potent in this respect. The three solvents, however, contrasted strongly in influencing motor activity.

Liver weights were unchanged. Total phospholipids were found to be reduced in the cerebral cortex where also a slight increase in phosphatidic acid was observed. In this brain region a minor fatty acid of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride, 22:5 (n-3), was decreased. No changes were observed in the brainstem. The data on brain weights and lipid composition after exposure to toluene indicates a breakdown of phospholipids resulting in a loss of gray matter. The mechanism for these changes is uncertain but may involve degradation of phospholipids by phospholipase D. The effective metabolism of xylene and toluene seem to protect from fatty acid changes of brain phospholipids previously observed after exposure to chlorinated ethylenes."

In the present study, we examined the effects of toluene on cerebellar Purkinje cell action potential output and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto Purkinje cells using patch clamp electrophysiology in acute rat cerebellar slices. Toluene (1mM) reduced the frequency of Purkinje cell action potential output without affecting input resistance. Furthermore, toluene dose-dependently enhanced inhibitory synaptic transmission onto Purkinje cells, increasing the amplitude and frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents; no change in the frequency of action potentials from molecular layer interneurons was noted.

The present study evaluated the effect of acute and repeated toluene inhalation (0, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm) on locomotor activity as well as striatal DA release and uptake using slice fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Acutely, 2,000 and 4,000 ppm toluene increased locomotor activity, while neurochemically only 4,000 ppm toluene potentiated electrically evoked DA release across the caudate-putamen and the nucleus accumbens. Repeated administration of toluene resulted in sensitization to toluene's locomotor activity effects. Brain slices obtained from mice repeatedly exposed to toluene demonstrated no difference in stimulated DA release in the caudate-putamen as compared to control animals. Repeated exposure to 2,000 and 4,000 ppm toluene caused a concentration-dependent decrease of 25-50 % in evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens core and shell relative to air-exposed mice. These voltammetric neurochemical findings following repeated toluene exposure suggest that there may be a compensatory downregulation of the DA system. Acute or repeated toluene exposure had no effect on the DA uptake kinetics.

In addition, more efficient methods for testing volatile chemicals are needed. Here we begin to address these issues by determining the utility of measuring behavioral responses of Drosophila melanogaster to airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a potential model system for discovering adverse outcome pathways and as a method to test for toxicity. In these experiments, we measured motor activity in male and female flies to determine concentration-effect functions for three VOCs that differ in their mode of action: toluene, a narcotic; acrolein, an irritant; and vinyl chloride, a hepatocarcinogen. These experiments were conducted in Flyland, an outbred population of flies derived from 40 lines of the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) in preparation for subsequent experiments with individual lines of the DGRP. Systematic, concentration-related changes in activity were observed with toluene, but not with acrolein; high concentrations of vinyl chloride reduced activity by a small amount. Despite higher activity levels in males than in females under control conditions, the sexes were equally sensitive to toluene. Transient increases in activity at the onset and offset of exposure to toluene and vinyl chloride suggested that the flies detected changes in air quality at concentrations that did not persistently suppress activity. The effects and potency of toluene are consistent with those observed in rodents. The lack of clear concentration-related changes in response to acrolein and vinyl chloride shows limitations of this method is for screening toxicity attributed to VOCs."

Two inhalation studies with multiple endpoints, one acute and one subchronic, were conducted to seek effects of the VOC, toluene, in rats and to compare the effects between acute and subchronic exposures. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to toluene vapor (n=6 per group) at a concentration of 0 or 1019+/-14ppm for 6hr in the acute study and at 0+/-0, 10+/-1.4, 97+/-7, or 995+/-43 ppm for 6 hr/d, 5 d/week for 13 weeks in the subchronic study. For the acute study, brains were dissected on ice within 30 min of the end of exposure, while for the subchronic study, brains were dissected 18 hr after the last exposure. Frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum were assayed for a variety of oxidative stress (OS) parameters including total aconitase (TA), protein carbonyls, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GRD), glutathione transferase (GST), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidants (TAS), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), and NADH ubiquinone reductase (UBIQ-RD) activities using commercially available kits. Following acute exposure, UBIQ-RD, GCS and GRD were increased significantly only in the cerebellum, while TAS was increased in frontal cortex. On the other hand, subchronic exposure affected several OS markers including increases in NQO1 and UBIQ-RD. The effect of subchronictoluene exposure on SOD and TAS was greater in the striatum than in the other brain regions. TA activity (involved in maintaining iron homeostasis and an indicator of DNA damage) was inhibited in striatum and cerebellum, increased in hippocampus, and unchanged in frontal cortex. Protein carbonyls increased significantly in both the frontal cortex and cerebellum. In general, the results showed that acute exposure to toluene affected OS parameters to a lesser extent than did subchronic exposure. These results suggest that toluene exposure induces OS in the brain and this may be a component of an adverse outcome pathway for some of the neurotoxic effects reported following toluene exposure."

The present electrocochleographic findings do not support a specific mid- to high-frequency loss of auditory sensitivity. On the contrary, the electrophysiologic data, obtained for audiometric frequencies ranging from 2 to 32 kHz, showed a hearing deficit not only in the mid-frequency region (12-16 kHz), but also in the mid-low-frequency region (3-4 kHz). Actually, the effect of toluene was independent of the frequency in our experimental conditions. Histological analysis was consistent with electrophysiologic data because a broad loss of outer hair cells occurred in both mid- and mid-apical coil of the organ of Corti."

The layers of Ammon's horn and the subiculum were not affected qualitatively or quantitatively by the 500 ppm exposure. Within the area dentata, the volume of the granule cell layer was 6% smaller in animals exposed to 100 ppm and 13% smaller in animals exposed to 500 ppm than they were in controls. The volumes of the hilus, which is a terminal field of granule cell axons, and the commissural-association zone of the dentate molecular layer, which is the terminal field of the hilar projection to the granule cells, were smaller (12% and 19%) in animals exposed to 500 ppm than they were in controls. Argyrophilic cells were found in the granule cell layer of all animals exposed to 500 ppm. Pronounced granule cell degeneration was found in one animal exposed to 500 ppm. The granule cell layer of animals exposed to 100 ppm appeared qualitatively normal. The alterations reported here support the few earlier reports of morphological alterations in the CNS of adult laboratory animals. Effects of toluene similar to those described, that is alterations in specific neuron populations and their afferent and efferent terminal fields may complement changes in neurophysiology and behavior that have been observed in prenatally and perinatally exposed rodent pups. Causal relationships, however, remain to be elucidated."

Because inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is one of the possible mechanisms underlying developmental neurotoxicity of toluene, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of toluene exposure during two major neurodevelopmental stages, brain growth spurt and adolescence, on NMDA receptor-mediated current. Rats were administered with toluene (500 mg/kg, i.p.) or corn oil daily over postnatal days (PN) 4-9 (brain growth spurt) or PN 21-26 (early adolescence). Intracellular electrophysiological recordings employing in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal slices were performed during PN 30-38. Toluene exposure during brain growth spurt enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by electrical stimulation, but impaired the paired-pulse facilitation and NMDA response by exogenous application of NMDA. Toluene exposure during adolescence resulted in an increase in NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs and a decrease in exogenous NMDA-induced currents, while lack of any effect on paired-pulse facilitation. These findings suggest that toluene exposure during brain growth spurt and adolescence might result in an increase in synaptic NMDA receptor responsiveness and a decrease in extrasynaptic NMDA receptor responsiveness, while only toluene exposure during brain growth spurt can produce presynaptic modulation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The functional changes in NMDA receptor-mediated transmission underlying developmental toluene exposure may lead to the neurobehavioral disturbances."

Although abuse levels of prenatal toluene exposure can lead to a Fetal Solvent Syndrome, there is little research examining these effects on memory. Consumption of toluene can have detrimental effects on the developing hippocampus which could lead to specific spatial learning and memory deficits. This study used a rat model to determine how prenatal exposure to abuse levels of toluene would affect performance in a spatial learning and memory task, the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0, 8000 or 12,000 ppm of toluene for 15 min twice daily from gestation day 8 (GD8) through GD20. Male and female offspring (N=104) were observed in the MWM for 5 days beginning on postnatal day (PN) 28 and again on PN44. While prenatal toluene-exposed animals did not differ in initial acquisition in the MWM, rats prenatally exposed to 12,000 ppm toluene displayed performance deficits during a probe trial and in reversal learning on PN44. Overall, this study indicates that prenatal exposure to repeated inhaled abuse patterns of high concentrations of toluene can impair spatial memory function that persists into adolescence."

The effects of CIT on behavior and recovery were monitored. Locomotor activity was recorded following two consecutive injections of amphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) 72 and 96 hr after the last exposure. This was followed with injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 20 days after the last exposure. CIT resulted in a significant and persistent retardation in weight gain during the exposure period and abstinence (p<0.05). Repeated exposure resulted in tolerance to the onset of toluene-induced behaviors and recovery latency. There was a reduction in the acute stimulant effects of amphetamine in CIT-exposed animals and an increase in the magnitude of locomotor activity (p<0.0125) following a subsequent exposure when compared to the responses observed in controls; this was associated with altered locomotor responses to MK801. Repeated exposure to CIT during adolescence alters parameters of growth, as measured by body weight, and leads to tolerance, indicating that increasing concentrations of the compound may be needed to reach the same behavioral state. Toluene during this period also alters responses to a psychostimulant which may be related to long-term glutamatergic dysfunction."

This technique permits the control of solvent dose and time of exposure. Results showed a 3 Hz spike-wave activity in the gyrus cinguli recording with both toluene or benzene intoxication. Furthermore, benzene inhalation produced generalized tonic-clonic seizures. These effects were dose-related. However, a sensitization period was essential for the development of such alterations, and effects showed a tendency to shortening through chronic exposures. These alterations were correlated with behavioral disturbances such as nodding, twitching and apparent hallucinations. Results are discussed regarding the sensitization period, the optimal peak of effects, and the period of tolerance development relevant to an earlier found amygdalar activation that could be correlated with other methods inducing experimental seizures, such as repetitive stimulation of the brain (kindling)."

Compounds were examined using two different ICSS procedures in mice to determine the generality of each drug's effects on ICSS and the sensitivity of the procedures. Male C57BL/6J mice with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle were trained under a three-component rate-frequency as well as a progressive ratio (PR) ICSS procedure. The effects of nitrous oxide, toluene vapor, cocaine, and diazepam on ICSS were then examined. Concentrations of 1,360-2,900 parts per million (ppm) inhaled toluene vapor significantly facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure and 1,360 ppm increased PR breakpoint. A concentration of 40% nitrous oxide facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure but reduced PR breakpoint. Doses of 3-18 mg/kg cocaine facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure, and 10 and 18 mg/kg increased PR breakpoint. Doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg diazepam facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure, and 3 mg/kg increased PR breakpoint. The reinforcement-facilitating effect of toluene in ICSS is at least as great as diazepam. By contrast, nitrous oxide weakly enhances ICSS in only the rate-frequency procedure. The data suggest that the rate-frequency procedure may be more sensitive than the PR schedule to the reward-facilitating effects of abused inhalants."

Samples of chamber air for analysis were taken through another port. A smaller mesh cage held the mouse within the larger chamber. Schedule-controlled responding was developed by arranging that a response, breaking a beam of light, was followed by milk under an Fl 60 sec schedule. Responding was much more rapid in the presence of stimuli correlated with the Fl schedule than when the schedule was not operating. Standard sessions consisted of alternating series of 8 consecutive Fl 60 sec and inter-series 30 min time-outs. Toluene disappeared from the atmosphere of the unopened empty chamber at the rate of 0.2%/hr. When the mouse cage was in the chamber the disappearance was 1.5%/hr and when a mouse was also present it was 3.7%/hr. Concentration-effect curves were determined by exposing a mouse to incremental additions of toluene at 30 min intervals. Toluene increased the rate of responding in most mice at levels of about 700 ppm. Higher concentrations progressively reduced responding. The ED50 (the concentration reducing responding by 50%) averaged 1657 ppm in 10 mice. In the appendix, principles for the assessment of hazard from results of this type are presented. It is estimated that there is a 1/1000 chance of the responding of a mouse being reduced by as much as 10% by a concentration of toluene of 69 ppm."

Hepatic ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism and liver histopathology were also investigated. Chronic intermittent toluene (CIT) exposure throughout adolescence for up to 8 weeks did not alter the behavioral response to acute ethanol or voluntary consumption of ethanol in adulthood, although an age-dependent effect on ethanol consumption was observed (p<0.05). Both liver function and pathology did not differ between treatment groups.
