            "content": "The study investigated the impact of various commercial nonionic polyoxyethylene surfactants on the foliar penetration and movement of ethirimol and diclobutrazol, systemic fungicides, in wheat plants. Application of both fungicides was in 0.2 PI droplets of aqueous suspension formulations containing 0.5 g litre-1 of C-labelled active ingredient, with surfactants at concentrations of 0.2-10 g litre-1. Optimal uptake required surfactants with specific properties; for diclobutrazol, low E content (5-6) surfactants at 5 g litre-1 were best, while ethirimol uptake was enhanced by surfactants with E content >10 at lower concentrations (<1 g litre-1). Aliphatic alcohol hydrophobe surfactants were more effective in uptake than nonylphenol-based ones. 'Tween 20' was effective only for ethirimol, while 'Synperonic PE",
