Pebulate was also inhibitory to nitrification(1). Available data indicate that soil microorganisms contribute to the disappearance of thiocarbamate herbicides, such as pebulate, when incorporated in soil and several sites of microorganism metabolic attack have been suggested: the alkyl groups, the amide linkage, or the ester linkage(2). The mechanism for the microbial degradation of thiocarbamate herbicides, such as pebulate, is unknown; however, it has been postulated that they could undergo hydrolysis at the ester linkage with the formation of a mercaptan and a secondary amine(3). The mercaptan could then be converted into an alcohol by transthiolation and further oxidized to an acid prior to entering the metabolic pool(3). In a study examining the loss of thiocarbamate herbicides in nonsterile soils, 50% of the initial concentration of pebulate was lost in moist clay and loam in 2-3 weeks(3). Using an aerobic sandy loam, pebulate was biodegraded with a half-life of 36-60 days(4)."

No treatment related mortality was observed. Treatment-related clinical observations included the following: (1) Slight or moderate erythema and edema in the mid- and high-dose males and females; (2) desquamation, skin sensitive to touch and thickening of the skin in the high-dose males and females; and (3) upward curvature of the spine mostly in the high-dose females. Significant body weight gain deficits (decreased 28.7%) and reduction of food utilization (decreased 29%) were observed in the high-dose females only. Hematology showed a 48% reduction in neutrophils count in the high-dose females compared to the control. There were dose-related increases in absolute and relative adrenal weights of males and females, but statistical significance was reached only in the high-dose females. For dermal irritation, the NOAEL was established at 1 mg/kg/day (both sexes) and the LOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day based on erythema and edema. For systemic toxicity, the NOAEL was established at 100 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) for both sexes, and the LOAEL was not established. This study is selected because its duration and route of exposure are appropriate for short and intermediate term dermal exposure. Slight to moderate dermal irritations were observed at mid- and high-dose groups. Systemic effects were similar to those observed in other studies. Although there were some body weight gain decrements and decreased food utilization in females at 100 mg/kg/day, they were judged to be confounding because of the following data: (1) there were no difference in absolute body weight; (2) the decreased body weight gain was equivocal at all doses in the females; (3) the decreases were significant only on sporadic days and did not exhibit any consistency over time; and (4) decreased body weight gain can be attributed to the dermal irritation, which was severe in the high dose groups. Based on these factors, the /USEPA/Hazard Identification Assessment Review Committee concluded that the 100 mg/kg/day dose is the NOAEL (not the LOAEL)..."

No treatment-related mortality was observed. An earlier onset and an increased incidence of salivation were observed in a dose-related fashion. Body weight gain was depressed (912% and 99% in males and females, respectively) at 0.079 mg/L at the end of the study whereas food consumption remained unaffected by treatment. No treatment-related changes were noted in hematology and clinical chemistry at 3, 9, or 14 weeks. Brain, plasma, and red blood cell cholinesterase activities were measured at weeks 3, 9, and 14 of the study. Significant inhibitions of red blood cell cholinesterase (decreased 42% in males and decreased 39% in females) and brain cholinesterase (decreased 26% in males only) were observed at the highest dose tested in week 14 of the study. Blood coagulation time (test for clotting factors) was prolonged in males and females at 0.016 and 0.079 mg/L; bleeding times (test for platelet function) were not significantly increased by treatments. Relative liver weights in both sexes, relative adrenal weights in females, and relative testes weight in males were significantly increased at the highest dose tested. However, none of these changes were correlated with histopathologic lesions in these organs. In contrast, the relative kidney weights, which were significantly increased in both sexes of the high-dose at 14 weeks, are associated with histopathological changes in the kidney. In males, regenerative tubular hyperplasia was observed to increase with doses at incidences of 4/12, 6/12, 8/11, and 9/11 in control, 0.0034, 0.016, and 0.079 mg/L, respectively. Degeneration and vacuole formation in kidney epithelium of female rats increased from 0/12 in control to 4/12 and 6/12 at the two highest dose levels. Furthermore, an increase in the incidence of mucigenic epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal turbinate was observed in both sexes (becoming dose-related in females), suggesting possible irritative effects of pebulate to the nasal passage at all doses over the 14-week course of exposure. Under conditions of this study, the NOAEL was 0.0034 mg/L and the LOAEL was 0.016 mg/L based on prolonged coagulation time, degenerative effects in kidney and increased incidences of mucigenic epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal turbinate."

Increased mortality was observed in the high-dose males only during the first 7 months of the study. Clinical signs (pale eyes and extremities, red oral and nasal discharges, and general poor condition) were observed in the high-dose males which died or were sacrificed moribund during the first year of the study. Ophthalmological findings (zonal disjunction, retinal degeneration, and cataracts) were observed mostly in the high-dose males and females, and less frequently in the mid-dose males and females. Complete cataract was observed in 10.7% malesand 14.7% females of high-dose group compared to that in 3.3% males and 0% females of the control group. Decreased body weights in the high-dose males (decreased 7-21.4%) and females (decreased 6.4-39.9%), were observed throughout the study (weeks 2-105), and in the mid-dose males (decreased 3.4-8.2%) during weeks 3-69 and the mid-dose females (decreased 4.2-16.6%) during weeks 3-97. Significant body weight gain deficits were observed in the high-dose group (decreased 39% in males and decreased 56.2% in females) when compared to the control. Increased food consumption was observed in the high-dose males and females; and occasionally for the mid-dose males and females. Hematology parameters showed increased thromboplastin times in the high-dose males and females and increased Factor VII values in the high-dose males at the 12 and 24 months sampling intervals. Clinical chemistry showed increased blood cholesterol and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and decreased triglyceride and glucose values in the high-dose males and females at most sampling times. Necropsy did not reveal treatment-related abnormalities when compared with controls. No significant difference in organ weights was observed in the low- and mid-dose males and females compared to the controls. In the high-dose group, most organ weights and organ/body weight ratios were statistically different from those of the control group. However, because these differences from control were secondary to the observed decreases in body weight gain, they were not indicative of primary organ toxicity. There was an increased incidence and severity of necrotic lesions in the livers of the high-dose male rats dying prematurely. Other microscopic findings in the high-dose male rats dying prematurely included hemorrhages in the epididymides, liver, testes, thoracic spinal cord and thymus; inflammation of epididymides and skin; islet hyperplasia (pancreas) and extramedullary hematopoiesis (liver). Although pebulate causes Wallerian-type degeneration in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves in dogs, this was not observed in this study. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential for pebulate in this study. The doses were considered adequate for testing the carcinogenic potential for pebulate in both sexes. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity was 15 ppm (equivalent to 0.74 mg/kg/day for males and 0.85 mg/kg/day for females) and the LOAEL was 150 ppm (equivalent 7.12 mg/kg/day for males and 9.4 mg/kg/day for females) based on decreased body weights of both sexes and increased incidence of cataracts in both sexes."

The following treatment-related findings were observed in the 500 mg/kg male and/or female groups: (1) clinical findings (decreased activity, hunched posture, splayed gait, decreased visual placement response, piloerection, irregular breathing, ptosis, chromodacryorrhea, rigidity during handling, signs of salivation, and urinary incontinence); (2) decreases in group mean body weight and food consumption during the first week after dosing; (3) increases in the landing foot splay and time to tail flick; (4) decreases in the hindlimb grip strength (males) and motor activity; and (5) increased incidence of neuronal cell necrosis in the pyriform and dentate gyrus cortices. Clinical signs were observed at 5-6 hours after dosing and disappeared within 1-2 days. Treatment-related effects, observed in the 150 mg/kg group, were (1) decreased activity, increased breathing rate, and decreased motor activity in females; and (2) increased incidence of neuronal cell necrosis in the brain of males and females. Treatment-related findings were not observed in the 50 mg/kg group. Pebulate had no effect on cholinesterase (brain, plasma and erythrocyte) and neurotoxicesterase activities, brain measurements (weight, length and width), and macroscopic pathology. The lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for neurotoxicity is 150 mg/kg based on decreased motor activity and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) is 50 mg/kg..."
