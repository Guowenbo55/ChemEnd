Amiben was more strongly adsorbed to soil with high organic matter content; furthermore, adsorption of Amiben to soil particles significantly reduced herbicidal activity(5). Based on adsorption studies of 12 soils, a mean Koc value of 190 was determined for amiben(1). In another adsorption study, an experimental Koc value of 21 was determined for Amiben(2). These Koc values indicate that Amiben will have high to very high mobility in soil and will leach(4). However, protonated Amiben may exhibit higher adsorption at lower pHs than its Koc values indicate(SRC)."
