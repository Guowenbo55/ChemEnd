An oral dose of 233 mg/kg 5-nonanone admin to rats 5 days/wk for 13 wk produced a minor subclinical neuropathy. When the same amt of 5-nonanone (233 mg/kg) was present as an 11% contaminant in a commercial lot of 5-methyl-2-octanone, neuropathy developed in less than 90 days. The neuropathy following 5-nonanone admin results in axonal damage in the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum."

In the majority of cases, the animals of both species significantly discriminated concentrations below 1 ppm from the odorless solvent, and with 2-nonanone and 5-nonanone the monkeys even demonstrated thresholds below 1 ppb. The results showed both primate species have a well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic ketones, and pigtail macaques generally perform better than squirrel monkeys in detecting members of this class of odorants. Further, in both species tested, ...  a significant negative correlation between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection thresholds and carbon-chain length of both the 2-ketones and the symmetrical ketones /was found/, but not between detection thresholds and position of the functional group with the C7-ketones. ..."
