            "content": "The study on the novel herbicide pyribambenz-propyl in oilseed rape plants showcased intriguing translocation characteristics within different growth stages. In seedlings, the herbicide was absorbed mainly by the leaves, with over 89% remaining within the treated leaf, indicating limited mobility within the young plants. Despite both acropetal and basipetal movement, a significant portion stayed within the treated leaf, indicating constrained mobility. As for mature plants, around 94% of the absorbed herbicide remained in the treated leaf, albeit slightly lower than in seedlings. The distribution within mature plants showed accumulation primarily in leaves, especially in the treated leaf and leaves above it, with lesser translocation to roots and other parts. These findings highlight limited mobility of pyribambenz-propyl within oilseed rape plants, predominantly retained in the treated leaves, which could influence its efficacy against targeted pests and its potential environmental impact.",
