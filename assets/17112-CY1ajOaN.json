The use of adjuvants alongside glyphosate influenced its phytotoxicity to quackgrass, with bentazon reducing the translocation of 14C. In other perennial and annual weed species, glyphosate moved to regions of high metabolic activity. Glyphosate application reduced the total photosynthesis more in quackgrass than in wheat, indicating varying effects on different plant species. The study aimed to understand factors influencing herbicide action, absorption, and basipetal translocation, essential for effective weed control with foliar-applied herbicides like glyphosate. The addition of adjuvants, such as bentazon, impacted the translocation and activity of glyphosate in quackgrass, emphasizing the significance of formulations and adjuvants in herbicide effectiveness.",

The results showed that alligatorweed absorbed more than twice as much imazapyr compared to glyphosate when applied to the leaves. Furthermore, imazapyr exhibited greater translocation to the underground storage tissues of alligatorweed compared to glyphosate. This disparity in translocation to roots and subterranean storage tissues is suggested as a potential mechanism for the tolerance of alligatorweed to glyphosate and its susceptibility to imazapyr.",
