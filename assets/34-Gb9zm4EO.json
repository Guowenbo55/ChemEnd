Rat liver mitochondria were isolated in a medium consisting of 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Mitochondrial respiration was determined with an oxygen electrode at 30 \u00b0C and the polarographic buffer consisted of 250 mM mannitol, 10 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM potassium phosphate, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 0.2 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid (pH 7.4). With succinate as the respiratory substrate and using chloroethanols (150 mM), 2-chloroethanol stimulated respiration by 28.2 + or - 6 5% and 2,2-dichloroethanol by 202.7 + or - 8.2% while 2,2,2-trichloroethanol inhibited mitochondrial respiration (> 95%). The effect of change in the concentration of chloroethanols on mitochondrial respiration was also studied. Chloroethanol showed maximum stimulation at 600 mM (97.6%), 2,2-dichloroethanol at 150 mM (202.6%) and 2,2,2-trichloroethanol at 30 mM (313.6%). Respiratory stimulation was independent of mitochondrial protein concentration. Chloroethanols (optimal concentrations for respiratory stimulation with succinate) inhibited mitochondrial respiration when glutamate-malate was used as the respiratory substrate. Estimation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) showed that chloroethanols inhibited the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. These results indicate that chloroethanols stimulate mitochondrial respiration by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and that the uncoupling potency is proportional to the extent of chlorination at the beta-position of haloethanol."
