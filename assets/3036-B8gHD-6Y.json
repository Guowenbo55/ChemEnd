    "Description": "DDT is a chlorophenylethane that is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane substituted by additional chloro substituents at positions 4 of the phenyl substituents. It is a commonly used organochlorine insecticide. It has a role as a bridged diphenyl acaricide, a carcinogenic agent, a persistent organic pollutant and an endocrine disruptor. It is an organochlorine insecticide, a benzenoid aromatic compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a chlorophenylethane. It is functionally related to a 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane and a 4,4'-dichlorodiphenylmethane.",

Organochlorine levels in wings were compared to other body parts. Tissues from 12 species collected at 10 sites were analyzed for organochlorines. Wings were ground and macerated, extracted, and analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. All wings contained DDT and DDE. No organophosphates were detected. The mean concentrations for male Pacific black ducks were 42.13 ppm (wing), 2.1 ppm (brain), 10.03 (liver), 331.29 ppm (fat), and 3.43 ppm (breast muscle). Highly significant positive correlations were found between DDT residues in wings and each of the body parts examined. Similar trends were observed for birds collected at various locations. It is suggested that monitoring be conducted to follow changes in organochlorine levels and reveal possible problem areas."

            "Value": "DDT is biodegraded by a number of microorganisms isolated from water, sediments and soils(1,2). Biodegradation under environmental conditions has been shown to be quite variable, however, with a number of factors playing a role, especially the presence of anaerobic conditions and high populations of the required microorganisms(1,2). In certain flooded soils, DDT is readily degraded with complete degradation in one soil in approximately 31 days(3). Degradation has been demonstrated in soils under anaerobic conditions, while little or no degradation was observed under aerobic conditions(1,2,4). Various amendments to soils such as energy and carbon sources, were shown to increase degradation under anaerobic but not aerobic conditions(1,4,5). Reported half-lives for DDT in soils range from 2 years to > 15 years(6-9). Using a river-die away test, no change in DDT concentration was found in raw river water over a period of 8 weeks(10). DDT incubated in 6 lake water samples was converted to DDD (1,1'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane), with greater conversion in samples with large amounts of plankton - up to 95% conversion in one sample(1). Six marine water samples showed poor metabolic activity with respect to DDT degradation(11). DDT degradation of up to 67% in sediments in up to 24 weeks has been reported(12). DDT is apparently co-metabolized by microorganisms and is not used as a sole carbon source(1). Products of biodegradation include DDD and DDE (1,1'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethylene); occasionally DBP (4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone) is formed appreciably(1,2)."

A study was undertaken to study the fate of DDT in a forest litter macro-arthropod food chain. Collembola were fed o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE and then released into the field. Over a period of a few days, p,p'-DDT was degraded below 0.01 ppm and only p,p'-DDE was detected. The most rapid converters of p,p'-DDT among the arthropod cryptozoan predators were Thomisidae, Elateridae larvae, Carabidae, and Staphylinidae. Formation of o,p'-DDE started almost immediately after feeding on o,p'-DDT-fed Collembola. The conversion of o,p-DDT to p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE is reported. p,p'-DDD was also observed as a metabolite of p,p'-DDT. When p,p'-DDE was used, no identifiable metabolites were found. In another study, when DDT was applied to a forest, the data indicated that the decay of DDT residues in northern Maine soils could approximate the 35-yr half-life suggested by others."

Animals were gavaged with 300 mg/kg o,p'-DDT either once or once daily for 3 consecutive days. Liver samples were examined 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, or 24 h after a single dose or following three daily doses. For dose-response studies, a single dose of 3, 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg body weight o,p'-DTT was administered for 3 consecutive days. Genes associated with drug metabolism (Cyp2b2 and Cyp3a2), the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), cell proliferation (Ccnd1, Ccnb1, Ccnb2, and Stmn1), and oxidative stress (Gclm and Hmox1) were significantly induced. Cyp2b2 exhibited dose-dependent regulation and was significantly induced across all time points, while cell proliferation- and oxidative stress-related genes exhibited transient induction. The induction of Cyp2b2 and Cyp3a2 mRNA levels suggest PXR/CAR activation, consistent with expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. Few genes known to be estrogen receptor (ER) regulated were differentially expressed when compared to the hepatic gene expression profile elicited by ethynyl estradiol in immature ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice using the same study design and analysis methods. These data indicate that o,p'-DDT elicits PXR/CAR-, not ER-, mediated gene expression in the rat liver. Based on the species-specific differences in CAR regulation, the extrapolation of rodent DDT hepatocarcinogenicity to humans warrants further investigation."

            "Value": "Stability of cell-to-cell interactions and integrity of junctional membrane proteins are essential for biological processes including cancer prevention. The present study shows that DDT, a non-genomic carcinogen used at a non-cytotoxic dose (1 uM), rapidly disrupted the cell-cell contacts and concomitantly induced the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles close to the plasma membrane in the SerW3 Sertoli cell line. High-resolution deconvolution microscopy reveals that this vacuolization process was clathrin-dependent since a hyperosmotic media (0.2 M sucrose) blocked rhodamine-dextran endocytosis. In response to DDT, junctional proteins such as Cx43, N-Cadherin and ZO-1 were internalized and present in vacuoles. In Cx43-GFP transfected cells, time lapse videomicroscopy demonstrates that DDT rapidly enhanced fragmentation of the gap junction plaques and abolished the gap junction coupling without major modification of Cx43 phosphorylation status. Repeated exposure to DDT resulted in chronic gap junction coupling injury. The present results demonstrate that one of the early effects of DDT is to interfere with the plasma membrane and to perturb its function, specifically its ability to establish cell-cell junctions that are essential for tissue homeostasis and control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Such an alteration may play a specific role during carcinogenesis."

Novel results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, as well as the established environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT, were able to bind specifically to the hER with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities for the hER than that of estradiol. In contrast, only o,p'-DDT, but not p,p'-DDT, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. Moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the DDT isomers and metabolites could transcriptionally activate the hER, demonstrated that an o,p'-DDT metabolite could transactivate the hER or LexA-hER fusion protein with just a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that bound the hER in vitro triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacZ reporter gene in the yeast systems. Furthermore, the DDT isomers and metabolites that transactivated the hER elicited an additive response when given together or with estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that triggered transcription of the yeast expression-reporter systems also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the hER. Thus, in MCF-7 cells and in yeast expression-reporter systems, certain DDT isomers and metabolites act directly as agonists and transactivate the hER at concentrations found in human tissues."

To further characterize species-specific hepatic responses, gene expression analysis, with complementary histopathology and tissue level analyses were investigated in immature, ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice treated with 300 mg/kg o,p'-DDT, and compared to Sprague-Dawley rat data. Rats and mice exhibited negligible histopathology with rapid o,p'-DDT metabolism. Gene expression profiles were also similar, exhibiting PXR/CAR regulation with the characteristic induction of Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a11. However, PXR-specific target genes such as Apoa4 or Insig2 exhibited more pronounced induction compared to CAR-specific genes in the mouse. In addition, mouse Car mRNA levels decreased, possibly contributing to the preferential activation of mouse PXR. ER-regulated genes Cyp17a1 and Cyp7b1 were also induced, suggesting o,p'-DDT also elicits ER-mediated gene expression in the mouse, while ER-mediated effects were negligible in the rat, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of CAR on ER activities. In addition, o,p'-DDT induced Gadd45a, Gadd45b and Cdkn1, suggesting DNA damage may be an additional risk factor. Furthermore, elevated blood DHEA-S levels at 12 hr after treatment in the mouse may also contribute to the endocrine-related effects of o,p'-DDT. Although DDT is known to cause rodent hepatic tumors, the marked species differences in PXR/CAR structure, expression patterns and ligand preference as well as significant species-specific differences in steroidogenesis, especially CYP17A1 expression and activity, confound the extrapolation of these results to humans..."

There was excess mortality from week 60 onwards among mice of the P and F1 generations that had received 250 mg/kg of diet DDT. Only the incidence of liver-cell tumors was increased by exposure to DDT: males, 25/113(controls), 57/124, 52/104, 67/127, 82/103 in treated groups; females, 4/111 (controls), 4/105, 11/124, 13/104, 60/90 in treated groups. The excess of liver-cell tumors over that in controls in mice of each sex fed 250 mg/kg of diet DDT was significant (p<0.01). The excess over that in controls of liver-cell tumors in males fed 2, 10 or 50 mg/kg of diet was significant (p<0.01) in animals surviving more than 70 weeks. In females, all liver-cell tumors were found after 100 weeks of age, and the excess over that controls was significant (p< 0.05) in the group fed 50 mg/kg diet DDT and (p< 0.01) in the group fed 250 mg/kg of diet DDT. Four liver-cell tumors, all occurring in DDT-treated mice, gave metastases. No remarkable difference was observed between P and F1 mice in this study. In a continuation of this study, the effects of the same doses of DDT were studied in six consecutive generations of CF-1 mice (including the first two generations). The experiment involved a total of 2764 exposed and 668 control animals. Exposure to all four levels of DDT significantly increased the incidence of liver-cell tumors (hepatomas) in males; in females, hepatoma incidence increased considerably after exposure to 250 mg/kg. No progressive increase in hepatoma incidence from generation to generation was noted in treated mice. Malignant hepatoblastomas were observed at a slightly increased incidence in DDT-treated male mice: 3/328 in control males, 5/354, 14/362, 12/383 and 25/350 in 2, 10, 50 and 250 ppm DDT-treated males, respectively [positive trend, p<0.001]. Ten of 56 hepatoblastomas found in DDT-treated mice metastasized to the lungs. DDT did not alter significantly the tumor incidence at sites other than the liver."

The testes of DDT-exposed embryos consisted of mostly stroma with fewer seminiferous cords than controls while ovaries of exposed embryos contained larger numbers of distended medullary cords /and exhibited/ a difference in the distribution of these cords when compared to controls. There was an increased alkaline phosphatase activity in /ovarian/ stromal cells. ... Increased amounts of alkaline phosphatase activity found in the stroma at 12 days might be due to a DDT-induced stimulation of these cells to differentiate more rapidly. Acid phosphatase activity was found in the medullary cords of control 12-day ovaries, but was much reduced or absent in those of pesticide-exposed embryos. ..."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ Ten-day-old mice treated once with 0.5 mg technical DDT/kg/day demonstrated behavioral changes when tested at 4 months of age. The test entailed placing animals in a new cage with infrared motion detecting beams for 1 hour. Locomotion (horizontal movement), rearing (vertical movement), and total activity (vibration, tremors, grooming, movement) were scored and summed for each 20-minute period. Initially, motor activity was fairly comparable between DDT-treated mice and controls; locomotion and activity were similar, although rearing was increased. During the last 40 minutes in the box, the DDT-treated animals had significantly more locomotion, rearing, and activity than the controls. When control mice were placed in a new environment, such as the test cage, they initially increased their activity as they explored. Eventually, this exploratory activity decreased as they become familiar with their new environment; this phenomenon is known as habituation. Thus, the authors concluded that perinatal DDT exposure interferes with habituation, which is considered a simple, nonassociative learning process. The neurobehavioral effects in the 4-month-old mice only appeared after dosing at 10 days and not after similar dosing at day 3 or 19 of age. The induction period was limited to a peak in the rate of brain development and development of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Since this behavioral assay used motor exploration as the end point, an alternate interpretation of the observed results is that the DDT directly affected neural regulation of activity rather than learning; however, a problem with appropriate control of motor behavior would also be a functional deficit of concern ... One month after behavioral testing, the potassium-evoked release of acetylcholine from cortical slices was significantly increased in treated mice compared to controls. This is consistent with the well characterized effect of DDT in slowing the closure of sodium channels and thus causing general central nervous system stimulation and neurotransmitter release. Apparently, behavioral effects seen in adult mice represented a persistent neurological change since no residual DDT from their neonatal exposure remained in the brain ... Radiolabeled DDT was found in the brain at 1 and 7 days but not at 30 days following a single oral dose of 0.5 mg DDT/kg to 10-day-old mice. The classification of this effect as developmental, rather than an immediate effect of current DDT body burden, hinges on the apparent clearance of DDT before the behavioral testing ... The persistence of these observed neurochemical changes in muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex was also evaluated. The density of the muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the 3-month-old NMRI mice that had been given a single dose of 0.5 mg DDT/kg at 10 days of age was determined. The study authors reported a tendency towards a decrease in the amount of specific binding in the cerebral cortex, but no significant changes in the hippocampus and striatum. No significant changes were noted in choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or striatum. However, significant (p<0.01) decreases in cerebral cortex muscarinic receptors at 4, 5, and 7 months of age were seen in similar later studies from the same group of investigators."

In addition, mouse Car mRNA levels decreased, possibly contributing to the preferential activation of mouse PXR. ER-regulated genes Cyp17a1 and Cyp7b1 were also induced, suggesting o,p'-DDT also elicits ER-mediated gene expression in the mouse, while ER-mediated effects were negligible in the rat, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of CAR on ER activities. In addition, o,p'-DDT induced Gadd45a, Gadd45b and Cdkn1, suggesting DNA damage may be an additional risk factor. Furthermore, elevated blood DHEA-S levels at 12 hr after treatment in the mouse may also contribute to the endocrine-related effects of o,p'-DDT. Although DDT is known to cause rodent hepatic tumors, the marked species differences in PXR/CAR structure, expression patterns and ligand preference as well as significant species-specific differences in steroidogenesis, especially CYP17A1 expression and activity, confound the extrapolation of these results to humans..."

Animals were gavaged with 300 mg/kg o,p'-DDT either once or once daily for 3 consecutive days. Liver samples were examined 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, or 24 h after a single dose or following three daily doses. For dose-response studies, a single dose of 3, 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg body weight o,p'-DTT was administered for 3 consecutive days. Genes associated with drug metabolism (Cyp2b2 and Cyp3a2), the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), cell proliferation (Ccnd1, Ccnb1, Ccnb2, and Stmn1), and oxidative stress (Gclm and Hmox1) were significantly induced. Cyp2b2 exhibited dose-dependent regulation and was significantly induced across all time points, while cell proliferation- and oxidative stress-related genes exhibited transient induction. The induction of Cyp2b2 and Cyp3a2 mRNA levels suggest PXR/CAR activation, consistent with expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. Few genes known to be estrogen receptor (ER) regulated were differentially expressed when compared to the hepatic gene expression profile elicited by ethynyl estradiol in immature ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice using the same study design and analysis methods. These data indicate that o,p'-DDT elicits PXR/CAR-, not ER-, mediated gene expression in the rat liver. Based on the species-specific differences in CAR regulation, the extrapolation of rodent DDT hepatocarcinogenicity to humans warrants further investigation."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ ... 3-MeSO(2)-DDE /a DDT metabolite/ is a potent toxicant in the adrenal cortex, particularly of mice, and possibly in humans after local activation by cytochrome P-450. For example, whole body autoradiography of (14)C-labeled 3-MeSO(2)-DDE in female mice injected with the test material intravenously showed heavy accumulation of radioactivity confined to the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Morphological evaluation of the adrenals showed extensive vacuolation and necrosis of the zona fasciculata 1-12 days after a single dose of 25 mg/kg; degenerative changes were seen at 12.5 mg/kg. Studies in vitro showed a dose- and time-dependent covalent irreversible binding to protein and formation of water soluble metabolites. This was blocked by the cytochrome P-450 inhibitor, metyrapone, and the addition of reduced glutathione decreased binding. A subsequent study in mice administered 3-MeSO(2)-DDE intraperitoneally identified mitochondria in the zona fasciculata as the primary targets for 3-MeSO(2)-DDE-induced toxicity. Disorganization and disappearance of central cristae were observed as soon as 6 hours after a dose of 3 mg/kg. Higher doses showed mitochondrial vacuolization, followed by disappearance of mitochondria or cellular necrosis. /That group of researchers/ further suggested that of the two cytochrome P-450s expressed predominantly in the adrenal cortex, P-45011(beta) and P-450SCC, the former (which converts 11-deoxycorticosterone to cortisone) is involved in the metabolic activation of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE in mice. P-450SCC is also expressed in the ovary and testes, but no binding or toxicity was seen in these organs ... Direct evidence /was later provided/ for an involvement of adrenocortical mitochondrial P-450s in the bioactivation of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE. Intraperitoneal administration of radioactive 3-MeSO(2)-DDE to pregnant or lactating mice resulted in specific accumulation and binding of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE-derived radioactivity in the zona fasciculata of adrenals from 16- to 18-day-old fetuses or suckling pups, showing ready transplacental passage of the metabolite and transfer via maternal milk. The results also suggested that cytochrome P-45011(beta) was involved in the activation of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE in the fetal adrenal cortex. Quantitative measurements showed that 7 days after dosing, the amount of radioactive label of the pups adrenals was 2 and 3.6 times higher than maternal adrenals at the 1.5 and 25 mg/kg dose levels, respectively, suggesting that mother's milk may be an important route of exposure of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE in DDT-exposed animals ... A later study showed that P-45011(beta) seems to be expressed during gestation days 10-12 in the adrenal cortex in the mouse fetus. 3-MeSO(2)-DDE was also found to reduce the capacity of pups and maternal adrenals to secrete corticosterone by a mechanism possibly involving competitive inhibition of adrenocortical CYP11B1. Human adrenal glands in vitro were found also to bioactivate 3-MeSO(2)-DDE to a metabolite that bound irreversibly to mitochondria. Binding was inhibited by metyrapone indicating the involvement of cytochrome P-450, but the specific isozyme was not elucidated. The bioactivation and mitochondrial toxicity of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE observed in vivo has recently been reproduced in an ex vivo tissue-slice culture preparation."
