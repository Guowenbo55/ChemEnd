Approximately 93% of the initial 100 ppm maleic hydrazide added to autoclaved garden soil remained after 49 days(2). Approximately 86% of the initial 100 ppm maleic hydrazide added to gamma-irradiated garden soil remained after 42 days(2). Addition of 5 g of \"activated\" soil (soil which has been incubated previously for 3 months with 224 ppm maleic hydrazide) to 95 g of untreated soil had little effect on the rate of biodegradation(2). When maleic hydrazide (applied in the form of the diethanolamine salt as a 20% commercial spray) was applied to loamy soil (pH 5.5) in open field at a rate of 5 and 10 kg active material/ha, >90% was observed after 12 days(2). No maleic hydrazide was detected in the soil treated at 5 kg/ha after 129 days, whereas traces were detected in the soil treated at 10 kg/ha after 189 days(2). Maleic hydrazide at 120 mg/kg in soil grab samples has been observed to be metabolized by zero-order kinetics(4). In unsterilized soil, 56% of the 14C evolved as 14C02 after 225 days, whereas only 5% evolved from sterilized soil(5). Maleic hydrazide applied to muck, sand and clay at concentrations of 0.7-2.7, 1.0-3.75 and 0.85-3.4 ppm, respectively, had degraded 86-100%, 87-100% and 47-67%, respectively after 42 days(3).

The animals were examined for changes in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, hematological, clinical chemical, urinalytical, and ophthalmological parameters, organ weights, and gross and microscopic pathological  appearance. One male at the highest dose was killed in extremis in week 28; the findings at necropsy included a distended, fluid-filled abdomen, calculi in the urinary bladder, increased lobation of the pancreas, and enlarged liver and kidneys. Body-weight gain was reduced by >20% in animals of each sex at 2500 ppm and by >35% in those at 25,000 ppm, with no effects on food consumption. Increased serum enzyme activities and reduced albumin levels consistent with pathological effects in the liver were seen in animals at the high dose; the reduced serum chloride levels seen in animals at 2500 or 25,000 ppm may be secondary to the high potassium content of the diet. The urinary pH was increased consistently in dogs at 25,000 ppm. Decreased absolute and relative heart weights were seen in males at 2500 ppm and in males and females at 25,000 ppm but were not associated with adverse histological findings. Increased absolute and relative thyroid weights seen in males and females at the highest dose were consistent with the findings of foci of epithelial hypertrophy in some animals in these groups.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ The long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity of potassium maleic hydrazide (purity, >97.8%; <0.05 ppm hydrazine) was investigated in groups of 50 male and 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats, with 20 of each sex per group taken for interim sacrifice at week 52. The animals received diets providing doses of 0, 25, 500, or 1000 mg/kg bw/day. The dietary levels were varied to account for body-weight gain and food consumption and ranged between 262 and 1023 ppm, 5144 and 16,700 ppm, and 10,214 and 31,325 ppm for the low, intermediate, and high doses, respectively. As animals were housed in groups of five, the achieved doses in individual animals varied around the cage means, which were within 10% of the nominal value over the whole study. Owing to an error, five females in the control, low-, and middle-dose groups were mis-dosed for 38 weeks; these animals were excluded from the overall results. Survival to termination was >38% in all groups and >50% in the animals at the highest dose, with no treatment- related effects. Clinical signs (examined in all groups) and ophthalmoscopic results (only in the controls and animals at the high dose) appeared to be unaffected by treatment. Food consumption was increased by approximately 10% in animals at 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day, contrasting with a decrease (>10%) in body-weight gain from week 10 in these groups; similar effects were seen at the interim kill, but these did not achieved statistical significance. A dose-related decrease in leukocyte count seen at week 51 in males was reversed by week 104, when dose-related increases were seen in animals of each sex. These changes were not statistically significant individually but were all associated with an increase in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios; the biological implications to humans of such changes in the leukocyte picture in rats are unclear. Decreased blood urea nitrogen was seen in males at the highest dose in weeks 25 and 51 and in males at the middle dose in week 51; there was evidence of a similar slight effect in females at week 51. Serum phosphate levels were increased in males at the highest dose in week 25 and in males at the intermediate and highest doses in week 51; serum calcium was also increased in males at the middle and highest doses at week 51. Females at 500 mg/kg bw/day had increased alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase activities at week 25 and decreased serum chloride levels, but similar changes were not recorded subsequently. Evidence of decreased urinary pH in animals at the highest dose was seen in week 51. Statistically significant reductions (about 20%) in absolute liver weights in males at the highest dose at interim sacrifice and in males and females at the highest dose and females at the intermediate dose at termination were related, at least in part, to the reduced body weights in these groups. Although the relative liver weights were reduced in these groups, the reductions were not statistically significant and were without obvious pathological sequelae. No treatment-related effects were seen at interim sacrifice, during the study or at the terminal gross pathological examinations. Extensive microscopic pathological examinations were performed on all controls, animals at the highest dose, and animals that died during the study. Only the liver, kidney, lung, and heart (at week 104 only) from animals at the low and intermediate doses were examined at interim and terminal sacrifice. The incidence of myocarditis of the ventricle, described as fibrous or chronic, was increased in males at the highest dose at interim sacrifice and throughout the study, but as there was no dose-response relationship this may be a chance finding. The incidence of periacinar vacuolation of the liver was increased in males at the highest dose at interim sacrifice and throughout the study. A change in the pattern of renal lesions was seen in females at week 104, with a non-dose-related increase in the incidence of progressive nephropathy in all groups and a decrease in that of pelvic epithelial hyperplasia at the highest dose. The incidences of hydronephrosis and proteinaceous plugs in the urinary bladder were increased in males at the highest dose. Adrenal medullary hyperplasia and cystic degeneration were increased in incidence in males at the highest dose, with a non-significant increase in adrenal cortical hyperplasia and a decrease in cystic degeneration in females at the highest dose in week 104. The frequencies of cholesterol clefts in the pituitary and parafollicular-cell hyperplasia of the thyroid were increased in males at the highest dose. None of the incidences of alterations was consistent between the sexes, although there is some evidence that the kidney may be a target organ. It is therefore uncertain whether the lesions were due to maleic hydrazide. Occasional increases in tumor incidences were seen, but as these were not consistent between the two sexes and did not achieve statistical significance they are considered not to be directly attributable to maleic hydrazide. The NOAEL was 25 mg/kg bw/day on the basis of the marked effects on body-weight gain in the presence of increased food consumption, together with alterations in clinical chemical parameters at higher doses. /Maleic hydrazide, potassium salt/"

The doses were chosen on the basis of the results of a range-finding study in which there was total mortality at 2500 mg/kg bw/day. The dams were killed on day 28, their reproductive tracts examined, and the fetuses removed. All fetuses were examined for viability, sex, and external malformations and variations, and were then dissected for investigation of visceral abnormalities before staining with alizarin red S for skeletal examination. An increased incidence of alopecia in animals at the highest dose was the only clinical sign associated with treatment. Maternal body-weight gain was reduced at 1000 mg/kg bw/day on days 7-13 of gestation. A single death occurred during the treatment period, in a dam at 300 mg/kg bw/day, probably as a result of an accident during gavage. Treatment had no significant effects on the number of abortions, implantation rate, pregnancy rate, fetal weight, litter size, or fetal viability. Eight late resorptions from five litters occurred in the group at the highest dose, with 0, 1, and 2 in the controls and in the groups at the low and intermediate doses, respectively. The only malformation or anomaly clearly related to treatment was scapular defects, which were seen in four fetuses (three forked scapulae, one bent; 4%) at the intermediate dose and in two (two forked scapulae; 2%) at the highest dose, with none in controls or animals at the low dose. The incidence of such anomalies in historical control animals at the test facility was 1 in 1536 (0.065%). As these anomalies were not identical, however, they should not have been combined; the ranges were thus within those seen in rabbits at other test facilities. Given the low incidences and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship for the fetal effects, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg bw/day for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity and 300 mg/kg bw/day for maternal toxicity on the basis of increased absorptions and decreased body-weight gain at the beginning of treatment. /Maleic hydrazide, potassium salt/"

These levels were equivalent to 0, 81, 791, and 2405 mg/kg/day of maleic hydrazide for males and 0, 97, 932, and 2874 mg/kg/day for females. Parental animal groups (F0 and F1b) consisted of 15 males and 30 females per group. An additional dietary level of 50000 ppm was discontinued during the study because of reduced body weights of F0 adults and F1b pups. The reproductive indices of male and female parents were not adversely affected by the test material at any treatment level or at any time during the study. At 30000 ppm, however, reduced body weight gains were observed for F0 female parental animals during growth and reproduction phases and increased mortality was noted for F1b parental animals. Therefore, the parental NOEL is 10000 ppm (791 mg/kg/day and 932 mg/kg/day for males and females respectively) of maleic hydrazide and the LOEL is 30000 ppm (2405 mg/kg/day and 2874 mg/kg/day for males and females, respectively). At 30000 ppm, decreased body weight gains were also observed for F1b, F2a, and F2b pups during lactation. Based on these decreased body weight gains for pups, the developmental NOEL is 10000 ppm (791 mg/kg/day and 932 mg/kg/day for males and females, respectively) of maleic hydrazide and the LOEL is 30000 ppm (2405 mg/kg/day and 2874 mg/kg/day for males and females, respectively). /Maleic hydrazide, potassium salt/"

As the replicative DNA synthesis was suppressed by /hydroxyurea/, an enhancement of (3)-thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA above the control, as determined by microautoradiography, was considered to be due to unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by the mutagen. A significantly higher incorporation of (3)-thymidine into DNA of maleic hydrazide treated roots occurred, when labelling was applied 7 hr after the maleic hydrazide action, whereas at 24 hr only slight and at 32 hr no enhancement of DNA labelling above control was registered. A 3-14 day storage with 50% water content of Vicia faba seeds exposed to maleic hydrazide or methyl methanesulfonate resulted in a recovery from mutagen induced chromosomal damage and a significantly higher incorporation of (3)-thymidine into nuclear DNA. This supports the hypothesis that recovery from maleic hydrazide and methyl methanesulfonate induced chromosomal damage is mediated by excision repair during seed storage."

A dose related increase in sister chromatid exchange frequency was noted after a 24 hr treatment with maleic hydrazide. The magnitude of the sister chromatid exchange induction was similar for three different samples, suggesting that the effect was not caused by any impurity in the maleic hydrazide. The same increase in sister chromatid exchange frequency was noted whether maleic hydrazide was administered in the first cell cycle or in the second cell cycle after BrdUrd treatment. A higher increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange was induced following the 24 hr treatment as compared to the 12 hr treatment. The induction of chromosomal aberrations was affected by short treatments with maleic hydrazide. Chromosomal aberration induction was pH dependent. Maleic hydrazide did not induce sister chromatid exchange in bone marrow cells of mice treated orally with test doses ranging from 333 to 1000 mg/kg. Earlier research had indicated that maleic hydrazide was negative for inducing sister chromatid exchange. This may have been due to the shorter treatment times used in these earlier studies. /It was/ concluded that from these studies that maleic hydrazide is genotoxic in mammalian cells in vitro but not in vivo."

Based on a classification scheme(2), these Koc values suggest that maleic hydrazide has very high to moderate mobility in soil(SRC). In a field experiment in which 5 and 10 kg/ha of maleic hydrazide were applied, the hydrazide did not migrate below a depth of 10 cm(3). This may be due to extensive biodegradation of maleic hydrazide(3). Maleic hydrazide was shown to bind to the clay component in Aiken clay loam where anion exchange is the predominant process(4). In a study of the adsorption of maleic hydrazide in 22 different soils, adsorption was most significantly correlated to specific surface area, clay content, and pH(5). The lack of correlation of adsorption with organic content of the soils may have been partly caused by the low organic content of the soils studied (<2%)(5). Adsorption of the herbicide ranged from high to low(5). Based upon the above information, maleic hydrazide may generally be expected to be mobile in soils with low clay content and relatively immobile in soils with high clay content. The mobility also may be affected by pH and specific surface area of the soils(SRC)."

After middle leaf uptake, most MH was trapped and dissipated in the middle leaf, and the rest was transported to other parts mainly through the phloem. Soil absorption significantly reduced the uptake efficiency of the root system, in which MH was partitioned to dissipate in root protoplasts or transfer through the xylem and persisted in the plant. Tuber uptake enabled MH to remain in the flesh and maintain stable levels under storage conditions, but during germination, MH was translocated from the flesh to the growing buds, where it dissipated through the short-day photoperiodic regime. The results demonstrated successful application of the ICE method and provided necessary insights for real-time monitoring of MH translocation behavior to effectively improve potato edible safety.",
