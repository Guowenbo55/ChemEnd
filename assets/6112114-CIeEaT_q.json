    "Description": "Kresoxim-methyl is a carboxylic ester that is the methyl ester of (2E)-(methoxyimino){2-[(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]phenyl}acetic acid. A fungicide for the control of scab on apples and pears and other fungal diseases on a wide range of crops. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an oxime O-ether, an aromatic ether, a methyl ester and a methoxyiminoacetate strobilurin antifungal agent.",

A supervised field trial consisting of two experiments viz. soil application and foliar application was conducted in order to study the uptake, distribution, translocation and metabolism of kresoxim-methyl in paddy, treated at the rates of 250 and 500 g a.i./ha. Depending on the crop growth and stage (40, 60, 80 and 110 days after transplanting), different plant parts like foliage, shoot, roots, panicles, straw and grain, along with soil, were sampled and analysed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for parent compound kresoxim-methyl and its metabolites. The results revealed that there was little translocation of residues of kresoxim-methyl and its acid metabolite to various plants parts, i.e. foliage, roots, soil, shoot and panicle, and very little to straw and grains. The major route of metabolism was hydrolysis with formation of acid metabolite.",
