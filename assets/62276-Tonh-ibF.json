Seventy-one to 84% of applied 14 C-acifluorfen was recovered in leaf water wash of ivyleaf morningglory compared to 32 to 46% from pitted morningglory. Sixty-four percent of applied 14C-lactofen was recovered in leaf water wash 96 h after treatment in both morningglory species. Thirty-five to 37% more 14C from applied 14C-acifluorfen was found in pitted morningglory treated leaves than ivyleaf morningglory treated leaves. Less than 28% of applied 14C-lactofen was extracted from treated leaves of either morningglory species. Translocation and metabolism of 14C-acifluorfen and 14C-lactofen were minimal in both morningglory species.",
