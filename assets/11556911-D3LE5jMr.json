    "Description": "Tembotrione is an aromatic ketone that is 2-benzoylcyclohexane-1,3-dione in which the phenyl group is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 4 by chlorine, (2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)methyl, and methylsulfonyl groups, respectively. It is a post-emergence herbicide used (particularly in conjunction with the herbicide safener cyprosulfamide) for the control of a wide range of broad-leaved and grassy weeds in corn and other crops. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a sulfone, a cyclic ketone, an aromatic ketone, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an organofluorine compound, an ether and a beta-triketone.",

In 2018, a Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) population, KCTR was found to be resistant to multiple herbicides including, tembotrione in Kansas (KS), USA. However, the mechanism of tembotrione resistance in KCTR is not known. The objective of this study was to characterize the level of tembotrione resistance and investigate the mechanism of resistance to this herbicide in KCTR using a known susceptible Palmer amaranth population (KSS). Tembotrione dose response experiments revealed that KCTR Palmer amaranth is 23 times more resistant to this herbicide, than KSS. No difference in absorption or translocation of [14C] tembotrione between KSS and KCTR was found. However, the time required to metabolize 50% of tembotrione was shorter in KCTR than in KSS. More than 95% of tembotrione was metabolized at 6 hours after treatment (HAT) in the KCTR, compared to only 50% in KSS plants. Application of cytochrome P450-inhibitors (e.g., malathion or piperonyl butoxide), along with tembotrione reversed the resistance in KCTR. Furthermore, the KCTR plants showed 35-fold increase in constitutive expression of CYP81E8\u00a0gene compared to KSS. Nonetheless, the\u00a0HPPD\u00a0gene expression was not altered in KCTR Palmer amaranth. Our results suggest that enhanced metabolism of tembotrione possibly due to increased expression of CYP81E8\u00a0gene contribute to tembotrione resistance in KCTR. Metabolic resistance to herbicides is a challenge for weed management as such resistance predisposes weeds to evolve resistance to unknown herbicides even without selection.",

A wide collection of spring, winter, and EMS-derived mutant lines of wheat was evaluated for their response to tembotrione treatment. Two winter wheat (WW) genotypes (WW-1 and WW-2) were found to be least sensitive to this herbicide, surviving >6 times the field recommended dose (92 g ai ha\u20131) compared to the most sensitive genotype (WW-24). Further, HPLC analysis using [14C] tembotrione suggested that both WW-1 and WW-2 metabolized tembotrione rapidly to nontoxic metabolites. Pretreatment with a P450 inhibitor (malathion) followed by tembotrione application increased the sensitivity of WW-1 and WW-2 genotypes to this herbicide, suggesting likely involvement of P450 enzymes in metabolizing tembotrione similar to corn. Overall, our results suggest that the genotypes WW-1 and WW-2 can potentially be used to develop tembotrione-resistant wheat varieties.",
