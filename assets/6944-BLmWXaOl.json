An estimated BCF of 15 was calculated for 2-nitrotoluene(SRC), using a log Kow of 2.30(2) and a regression-derived equation(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: 2-Nitrotoluene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0.5% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI) test that employs a mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater, soil, and sludge(1). Other evidence supports complete aerobic degradation of 10 mg/L 2-nitrotoluene within 2 weeks when incubated in adapted aerobic composite river sediment and sewage sludges(3). When nitrotoluene-adapted activated sludges were used as an inoculum, however, 2-nitrotoluene (200 mg/L) was almost completely degraded (i.e. 98% removal) within 5 days when incubated at 20 \u00b0C(3). The screening studies using unadapted sludges gave similar results as the MITI test, and 2-nitrotoluene is confirmed to be non biodegradable according to the standard MITI test. Using a mixed culture isolated from a contaminated soil (near an ammunition plant), 2-nitrotoluene (at initial concentrations of 3.5 mg/L) degraded completely in 8 days in aerobic batch and continuous reactor tests(4)."

In general, anaerobic biodegradation of nitroaromatic compounds results in the reduction of the nitro group to an amino group(2). In anaerobic tests using wastewater from a munitions production facility, initial 2-nitrotoluene degraded by 58% in non-sterile conditions and by 18% in sterile conditions over a 36-day incubation period(3)."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2-nitrotoluene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Field monitoring at a munition factory site in Melbourne Australia found that 2-nitrotoluene migrated large distances in the subsurface soils(3); 2-nitrotoluene is reported to have low soil Kd sorption coefficients in a variety of soils types(3) indicating it will leach."
