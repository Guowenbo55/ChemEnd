Sampling was conducted in response to intense cyanobacterial blooms in the Gulf of Finland in July-August 2002, consisting of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon sp., and Anabaena sp. Nodularin has been found to bioaccumulate in the Northern Baltic sea flounder due to their consumption of blue mussels(1)."
