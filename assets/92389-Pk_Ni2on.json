    "Description": "Aclonifen is a primary amino compound that is aniline in which the phenyl group has been substituted at positions 2, 3, and 6 by chlorine, phenoxy, and nitro groups, respectively. A protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor, it is used as a herbicide against a broad range of weeds in a wide range of crops. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes, an aromatic ether, a C-nitro compound, a substituted aniline and a primary amino compound.",

It is strongly sorbed (Roc = 1700\u2010 16,000 l/kg) and poorly translocated by soybean plant root. Aclonifen persistence was hardly affected by the soil water content, while the soil temperature affected persistence even less. Half\u2010life values were between 19.3 and 56.5 days. Field studies showed that aclonifen is quite persistent but a little mobile, and the use of models to calculate predicted environmental concentration confirm that it does not represent an hazard for the groundwater and soil quality. Only in very dry conditions and in presence of run\u2010off events aclonifen sorbed on sediment may reach and contaminate the surface water catchment systems.",
