            "Value": "AEROBIC: Isophthalic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 78 of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test indicating ready biodegradability(1). Under aerobic conditions and following OECD guideline 301B, approximately 9%, 46%, 64%, and 77% of isophthalic acid contained in sludge was degraded after 2, 5, 7, and 12 days, respectively(2). Isophthalic acid is degraded by aerobic microorganisms isolated from soil and marine sediment(3,4); cultures isolated from marine cultures also degraded isophthalic acid under anaerobic conditions(4). After an acclimation to an activated sludge inoculum over a 24 day period, 84% of isophthalate was consumed in a respiratory test(5). Isophthalic acid completely degraded in 8 days in a biodegradation test that used a soil inoculum(6). In another  screening test, 95% of COD was removed in 5 days using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum(7). In anaerobic biodegradation tests using granular and digested sewage sludge inoculum, isophthalic acid (as isophthalate) could be completely mineralized with a lag phase for 50% degradation ranging from 74 to 156 days(8). Using bacteria from river water as inocula (Songhua River, China) and a sealed-bottled method, isophthalic acid was found to be readily biodegradable with first-order rate constant of 1.43/day(9)."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of isophthalic acid can be estimated to be 79(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that isophthalic acid is expected to have high mobility in soil(SRC). Isophthalic acid is a dibasic (2 displaceable hydrogen atoms) acid whose pKa1 is 3.70 and pKa2 is 4.60 at 25 \u00b0C(3) indicating that isophthalic acid will be largely dissociated in the environment in the anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4)."
