Greenhouse studies indicated that the fungicide had high preventive and residual activities at low concentrations against the disease. On the contrary, curative activity was not obtained even at a concentration as high as 500 \u00b5g/ml. The fungicide was also effective in controlling the disease by submerged application, indicating systemic movements in plants. When ^14C-labeled chlobenthiazone was applied to the leaves or roots of rice seedlings, radioactivity was found to be rapidly translocated to the untreated parts of the plants, confirming the results in pot trials. Furthermore, the rice seedlings exposed to the fungitoxic vapor were protected from the disease. It is suggested that both the systemic and the vapor phase activities must contribute to the effective disease control in fields. Some of the field trials demonstrated foliar or submerged application.\n\n\n\n\n",
