As a class, fluoroacetates are slowly destroyed by soil bacteria, and do not usually persist in soil for more than 2 months(2). Following the addition of sodium fluoroacetic acid to a New Zealand-based stream water ecosystem model with Myriophyllum triphyllum, fluoroacetic acid was detected as a degradation product; proposed soil biodegradation pathways for the acid were the formation of glycollate or formation of oxaloacetate degrading to fluorocitrate(3)."

            "Value": "The mechanism of action involves the incorporation of the fluoroacetate into fluoroacetyl-coenzyme A, which condenses with oxaloacetate to form fluorocitrate, which inhibits the enzyme aconitase and prevents the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the tricarboxylic (Krebs) cycle. Inhibition of this system by fluorocitrate results in reduced glucose metabolism and cellular respiration and affects tissue energy stores. /Fluoroacetic acid and derivatives/"

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of fluoroacetic acid can be estimated to be 1.4(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that fluoroacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of fluoroacetic acid is 2.59(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."

            "content": "A series of 14C-labelled benzoic acids was synthesized to investigate their phloem translocation in plants and assess the role of pKa and lipophilicity in determining their movement. When these substituted benzoic acids were applied to castor bean plants by injection into the petioles, the compounds with intermediate lipophilicity (2-fluoro-, 4-chloro-, and 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acids) exhibited the highest concentrations in phloem exudates. On the other hand, the more polar 4-methyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro- and pentafluorobenzoic acids showed lower translocation, possibly due to their lower pKa values compared to the other benzoic acids tested. The polar 4-ureidobenzoic acid and the lipophilic 3-(4-methylphenoxy)benzoic acid were both translocated less efficiently in the phloem. These findings align with previous observations on phenoxyacetic acids and provide further evidence for the significance of ionization in the accumulation and retention of chemicals in phloem sieve tubes.",
