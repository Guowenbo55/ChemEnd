Adult male New Zealand white rabbits were given 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg monosodium methanearsonate orally daily for 40 days. The doses were chosen to approximate exposures that could result at roadsides treated with monosodium methanearsonate. The digestive tracts of all treated rabbits appeared hyperemic & overdistended. The intestinal walls were fragile & the livers showed intense peripheral hyperemia. The kidneys appeared swollen. The major hepatic lesions included hepatocellular degeneration & periportal inflammation. The major kidney lesions included tubular nephrosis, interstitial nephritis, & vascular hyperemia. The severity of the lesions was dose related. The histopathological changes induced in the liver & kidney by monosodium methanearsonate were mild to moderate & appeared to be reversible. The hepatic changes induced by monosodium methanearsonate would impair function more than the renal lesions. Monosodium methanearsonate at relatively low doses can induce tissue damage & pathological lesions in New Zealand white rabbits."

Mortalities were recorded each day up to 96 hr. Aged tap-water was used for preparing all test solns. LC50 value for juvenile Procambarus clarkii was 101 ppm monosodium methanearsonate, & for adults was 1019 ppm monosodium methanearsonate. Comparing the overall toxicities of these pesticides, Thiodan was the most toxic to all crayfish; followed by Treflan, monosodium methanearsonate, Cutrine-plus & Oust."

The amounts of induced hepatic zinc-thionein were determined. Toxicity for ip admin, as measured by lethality, was in the order of m-arsenite >arsenate >DMA >MMA; thus the inorganic cmpds were much more toxic than the organic arsenic cmpds. There were no deaths following oral admin. All cmpds caused the formation of induced hepatic zinc-thionein, & induction was not dependent upon the mode of admin of As. Induction was observed at much lower doses of inorganic than organic cmpds. It was concluded that As causes the induction of zinc thionein in mice independent of the route of admin. /Sodium methylarsenate/"
