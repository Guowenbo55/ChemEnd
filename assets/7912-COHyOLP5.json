At an initial concn of 10 ppm diisopropylamine, 0% of the theoretical BOD was observed after an incubation period of 14 days in a screening study using sludge inoculum(2). In the same study using acclimated sludge inoculum, 31.5% of the theoretical BOD was observed after 15 days using the same initial concn of diisopropylamine(2).

The pKa of diisopropylamine is 11.07(4), indicating that the protonated form will be the predominant species in moist soils and cationic molecules generally adsorb to organic carbon and clays more strongly than their neutral counterparts(SRC)."
