    "Description": "Chloropicrin is a C-nitro compound that is nitromethane in which all three hydrogens are replaced by chlorines. It is a severe irritant, and can cause immediate, severe inflammation of the eyes, nose and throat, and significant injuries to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Formerly stockpiled as a chemical warfare agent, it has been widely used in the US as a soil fumigant, particularly for strawberry crops. It is not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as a fumigant insecticide, a nematicide and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a C-nitro compound, a one-carbon compound and an organochlorine compound.",

Most deaths occurred within 24 hr after exposure. The rest were caused by a high exposure concentration, and the dead animals were found on post-exposure day 9. In the nose-only exposure experiment, toxic effects were observed only in the first phase and they were similar to those in the whole-body exposure experiment.

In the lower respiratory tract, the following lesions were noted at increased incidences at the mid and/or high concentrations: peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrates in mid- and high-concentration males (20% and 24% vs 2% of controls) and females (34% and 56% vs 10% of controls); bronchiectasis in mid- and high-concentration males (56% and 82% vs none of the controls) and females (56% and 88% vs none of the controls); bronchiolar submucosal fibrosis in mid- and high-dose males (32% and 38% vs none of the controls) and females (26% and 44% vs none of the controls); alveolar histiocytosis in high-concentration males (58% vs 36% of controls) and high-concentration females (70% vs 28% of controls); and bronchioalveolar cell hyperplasia in high-concentration females (12% vs none of the controls). The lesions of the respiratory tract were considered treatment-related and were considered to be the result of chemical irritation and its sequela. High-concentration females had an increased incidence of corneal mineralization (22% vs 8% of controls) which may have been treatment-related. The LOAEL for chloropicrin in mice is 0.5 ppm (0.0034 mg/L), based on decreased body weights and body weight gains, increased lung weights, and histological changes in the nasal cavity and lungs. The NOAEL is 0.1 ppm (0.0007 mg/L). /99.6%/"
