Three different doses of imazaquin (0, 0.15 and 0.28 kg ha-1) were applied during the pre-emergence growth stage to Dolichos lablab, Cajanus cajan, Canavalia ensiformis, Crotalaria juncea, C. breviflora, C. spectabilis, Mucuna deeringiana, M. cinerea, M. aterrima, Lupinus albus, Helianthus annuus, Pennisetum glaucum, Avena strigosa and Raphanus sativus, and the results were evaluated in a greenhouse. C. ensiformis and M. cinerea were selected from these species for being the most tolerant, and they were then evaluated for absorption and translocation of 14C-imazaquin in two different growth stages: the cotyledonary stage and the emergence of the first pair of true leaves. M. cinerea individuals showed the best potential for translocating imazaquin to the shoot when compared to C. ensiformes, which accumulated the herbicide mostly in its roots. These plants had a higher ability to accumulate herbicide during their most advanced stage of development, which demonstrates their potential for use in areas that have residual imazaquin.",

Three treatments were applied to the 5th leaf of the main stem at growth stage 5: (1) 14C-chlormequat chloride, (2) CYCOCEL* CL containing 14C-chlormequat chloride, and (3) CYCOCEL* CL containing 14C-imazaquin. The majority of the radioactivity absorbed (more than 85%) remained in the treated leaf. Ten days after application, 94.4% of the 14C-chlormequat was found in the treated leaf for chlormequat chloride alone, compared to 88.2% for the chlormequat chloride plus imazaquin treatment. This suggests that imazaquin increases the mobility and distribution pattern of chlormequat chloride in the plant.",
