Organochlorine levels in wings were compared to other body parts. Tissues from 12 species collected at 10 sites were analyzed for organochlorines.

The mean concentrations for male Pacific black ducks were 42.13 ppm (wing), 2.1 ppm (brain), 10.03 (liver), 331.29 ppm (fat), and 3.43 ppm (breast muscle). Highly significant positive correlations were found between DDT residues in wings and each of the body parts examined. Similar trends were observed for birds collected at various locations.

DDE, PCBs, and pentachlorobenzene showed uniform levels, especially on a fat weight basis, while hexachlorobenzene, and octachlorostyrene were detected at various levels in different species. The results are discussed with respect to the concept of accumulation through food chains, and passive partition of chemicals between water and the organism's fat. Although the results to some extent support the idea of partition, other factors may have a decisive effect on the levels found in the different species. This is true for the bottom dwellers, where magnitude and circumstances of exposure may vary considerably between the different microenvironments."

Residue data /were compiled/ on 22 marine species and on micro- and macrozooplankton and plotted ... against their trophic levels. The overall picture roughly agrees with the concept of higher pesticide levels in higher trophic levels, although variation among the individual species within a trophic level was great. The variation was particularly great in trophic level 4, where several bird species (shags, ducks, gulls) are grouped together with some fish (eg, cod and whiting). Shags, in particular, showed very high dieldrin (highest) and DDE (second highest) residues, thereby contributing to the wide variation in this trophic level."

If the uptake of residues is through water, then given an environment with a stable contaminant situation, the fat in all species should accumulate a given pesticide or chemical approx to the same level, depending on the water solubility and partitioning of that chemical into the lipid phase. Such a situation, if observed in nature, would support the conclusion that accumulation is mainly through water."

DDE inhibited the translocation (secretion) of calcium between the gland mucosa & the uterine cavity. ATP-dependent binding of calcium to microsomal subfraction (FI) rich in fragments of the plasma membrane was reduced by 16%, whereas that to a subfraction FIII which bound calcium at a very high rate was decreased to 36%.

There are many reports that claim inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, generally acknowledged to play an important role in forming eggshells, by DDT, /DDE/ & some other derivatives, but there are just as many that deny this. ... Thus one is left with two alternatives to explain the phenomenon: 1) the carbonic anhydrase in the shell gland of avian species is unusually sensitive to chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, or 2) the in vivo inhibition observed is a result of some other effect, such as reduced enzyme production or the production of substances that suppress the activity of the enzyme."

            "Value": "Studies were made on the mechanism by which DDE causes eggshell thinning. Addition of DDE inhibits ATPase activities from freeze-dried duck shell gland mucosa homogenates. In vitro sensitivity to low DDE concentration varied with only Ca-ATPase, Na,K-ATPase inhibited below 3 ppm. In in vivo testing, 40 ppm was fed to laying white peking ducks. This level caused 13% shell thinning in 4 days, 18% in 1-3 mo. Thinning was maximal after approx 1 week and then remained constant. Ca-ATPase activity in whole gland homogenates from these ducks was reduced 24% after 4 days and 31% after 1-3 mo. It is suggested that carbonic anhydrase-ATPase, a sol enzyme known to be involved in eggshell formation, has a minor role in shell thinning caused by DDE in duck shells, while a major role is proposed for Ca-ATPase inhibition by DDE. DDE may inhibit a calcium pump in shell gland mitochondria."

Novel results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, as well as the established environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT, were able to bind specifically to the hER with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities for the hER than that of estradiol. In contrast, only o,p'-DDT, but not p,p'-DDT, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. Moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the DDT isomers and metabolites could transcriptionally activate the hER, demonstrated that an o,p'-DDT metabolite could transactivate the hER or LexA-hER fusion protein with just a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that bound the hER in vitro triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacZ reporter gene in the yeast systems. Furthermore, the DDT isomers and metabolites that transactivated the hER elicited an additive response when given together or with estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that triggered transcription of the yeast expression-reporter systems also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the hER. Thus, in MCF-7 cells and in yeast expression-reporter systems, certain DDT isomers and metabolites act directly as agonists and transactivate the hER at concentrations found in human tissues."
