            "Value": "Some effects of gravity on early morphogenesis are correlated with microtubule locations within cells. During first cleavage in Ilyanassa obsoleta embryos, a transitory polar lobe constriction forms and then relaxes, allowing the polar lobe to merge with one daughter cell. If the polar lobe is equally divided or removed, morphogenesis is severely disrupted. To examine microtuble locations during early Ilyanassa development, eggs were fixed and stained for polymerized alpha-tubulin during first cleavage. The mitotic apparatus assembles at the animal pole. The cleavage furrow forms between the asters, constricting to a stabilized intercellular bridge encircling midbody-bound microtubules, whereas the polar lobe constriction forms below and parallel to the spindle, constricting to a transitory intercellular bridge encircling no detectable microtubules. At metaphase an alpha-tubulin epitope is distributed throughout the spindle, whereas a beta-tubulin epitope is present predominantly in the asters. Incubation in hexylene glycol, a drug that increases microtubule polymerization, during mitosis causes the polar lobe constriction to tighten around polymerized alpha-tubulin and remain stably constricted. If hexylene glycol is removed, alpha-tubulin staining disappears from the polar lobe constriction, which relaxes, whereas microtubules remain in the cleavage furrow, which remains constricted. These observations suggest that asymmetric distribution of microtubules affects early Ilyanassa cleavage patterns, and that continued presence of microtubules extending through an intercellular bridge is important for stabilization of the bridge constriction prior to completion of cytokinesis. These data provide the basis for further analysis of the role of microtubules in possible microgravity disruptions of Ilyanassa development."

Hepatocellular hypertrophy coupled with increased liver weight was observed at 450 mg/kg/day in both sexes and in males only at 150 mg/kg/day. In the absence of degenerative or necrotic change this was considered an adaptive response to increased metabolic demand. At 150 and 450 mg/kg/day kidney histopathology (higher incidence and severity of acidophilic globules in the tubular epithelium) and increased kidney weights observed in male rats only are suggestive of male rat specific alpha-2-microglobulin nephropathy, this was subsequently confirmed by specific staining with Massons Trichrome stain. Local changes in the forestomach (hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and edema of mucosa and submucosa) and the glandular stomach (inflammatory cell infiltration and edema of the sub-mucosa) observed in both sexes at 450 and 150 mg/kg/day are indicative of a local irritative effect resulting from the oral gavage procedure. No effect was observed at 50 mg/kg/day. Observed effects were either fully or partially reversible over the 4-week recovery period. There were no adverse effects on other organs including the reproductive organs. This is considered the key study in the assessment of the longer term effects of hexylene glycol. Similar changes in the liver and kidneys were noted in the 14 day range finder for the 90 day assay."

This study provides initial information on possible toxicological effects likely to arise from repeated exposure on male and female reproductive performance, such as gonadal function, mating behaviour, conception, development of the conceptus and parturition. The study was conducted as a reproduction/developmental screening test according to the OECD 421 guideline. Three groups of 10 male and 10 female Sprague-Dawley rats received the test item, Hexylene glycol (purity 99.95%), by daily oral (gavage) administration for 4 weeks before mating, through mating, gestation and the beginning of the lactation period (until day 4 p.p.). The dose-levels were 200, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day. Another group of 10 males and 10 females received the vehicle, purified water, alone, under the same experimental conditions and acted as a control group. The dosing volume was 5 mL/kg/day. The concentration of the dosage forms were checked during each study period (weeks 1, 5, 8 and 10). Clinical signs and mortality were checked daily. Body weight and food consumption were recorded at designated intervals throughout the study. Males were sacrificed after at least 10 weeks of treatment, females on day 5 p.p..The adults were submitted for a macroscopic post-mortem examination, with seminology examination for the males, and designated organs were weighed. In addition, the numbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites were recorded for each female. A microscopic examination was performed on macroscopic lesions, livers, kidneys and forestomachs of males and females from all groups, and on reproductive organs (epididymides, testes and ovaries with oviducts) from the control and high-dose animals. The pups were observed daily for clinical signs, sexed and weighed on post-natal days (PND) 1 and 5. After their sacrifice on PND 5, they were examined to detect gross external and macroscopic abnormalities. The test item concentrations in the administered dosage forms remained within an acceptable range of variation in all analyzed weeks. No unscheduled deaths occurred in any male groups during the study. Two F0 females from the high-dose group were prematurely sacrificed on lactation day 2 or 3 following the death of their litter. Soft feces was noted in a few test item-treated parent males from all dose-levels for 1 or several days during the first half of the treatment period but was considered as non adverse. No relevant clinical signs were recorded for the parent females. Body weight and food consumption were considered not to have been affected by the test item treatment. There were no effects of treatment with the test item on mating performance or on the fertility index. All pregnant females gave birth to live pups, the length of gestation was similar in all groups and no difficulties at delivery were observed. Pre-implantation loss was similar in all groups. At 1000 mg/kg/day, there was a marked increase in pup mortality during the five days after birth and body weight gain of the surviving pups was reduced. At 500 mg/kg/day, there was a slight increase in post-implantation loss, together with a slight increase in pup mortality up to PND 5. Pup sex ratio on PND all groups and pup body weight gain up to PND 5 at 200 and 500 mg/kg/day were unaffected by the treatment of the parents with the test item. There were no relevant external or macroscopic abnormalities in the pups from any group. Test item treatment had no effects on spermatozoa motility, morphology, or epididymal and testicular sperm count. A dose-related increase in kidney and liver weights was noted in the males at 200 or 500 mg/kg/day and in the males and females at 1000 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related macroscopic post-mortem findings were noted. At microscopic examination, adverse altered liver cell foci (clear cell- and basophilic cell-types) were recorded in some males at 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day and hepatocellular hypertrophy was noted in the males at 200 mg/kg/day and in males and females at 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day. Hyaline droplets along with basophilic tubules were found in the tubular epithelium of the kidneys from the males at 200, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day. Minimal hyperplasia of squamous cells together with hyperkeratosis of the forestomach was seen in some males at 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day. Based on the results of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for Hexylene glycol was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day for the parent females and 200 mg/kg/day for the parent males, because of the adverse microscopic findings in the liver at 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day in males only. The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) for reproductive performance (mating and fertility) was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day. The conservative NOEL for the F1 offspring up to PND 5 was considered to be 500 mg/kg/day, based on the increased pup mortality and reduced body weight gain at 1000 mg/kg/day."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol is expected to have very high mobility in soil(SRC)."
