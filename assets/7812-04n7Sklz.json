            "Value": "The average BCFs in the whole body of carp exposed to 4-chloroaniline in flow-through experiments (25 \u00b0C, 12 L/hr) for 24 to 336 hr at high (10.4 ug/L) and low (0.30 ug/L) exposure levels were 0.8 and 1.7, respectively(3). Excretion was rapid with depuration rates and half-lives of 0.16/hr and 4.3 hr, respectively(3). Therefore, 4-chloroaniline should not bioconcentrate in fish. Uptake was rapid in static tests (0.20 umol/L, 26 \u00b0C) on zebrafish and a BCF of 8.1 was obtained for 24 hr exposure(4). Elimination was best described by a two compartment first order model(4). After 53 hr of depuration, the concn of 4-chloroaniline in the zebrafish declined to 12.0% of the steady state value. The log BCF in Golden orfe was <1.30 for 3 day exposure(1). The 24-hr log BCF in green alga was 3.08 (dry wt basis(2)) and 2.42 (wt weight basis(1)). A BCF of 13.4 was reported for guppy (Poecilia reticulata)(5). According to a classification scheme(6), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The results of biodegradability screening studies for 4-chloroaniline are conflicting with results ranging from no degradation to rapid degradation using soil, sewage, activated sludge and fresh water inocula(SRC). The most frequently reported results are that 4-chloroaniline biodegrades rather slowly with acclimation(1-5). The reason for the conflicting results may be due to toxicity of metabolic intermediates(1), differences in concentrations and inocula used, sensitivity of 4-chloroaniline to chemical oxidation, and lack of sufficient acclimation(SRC). Some results are summarized as follows. 4-Chloroaniline degraded 28% after 5 days using the GSF Biodegradation Test(2). In a Modified OECD Screening test, 10% and 18% degradation in 28 days of 4-chloroaniline was observed(2,5). Using a Closed Bottle Test, no degradation of 4-chloroaniline was observed in 28-30 days(2,3). 4-Chloroaniline was degraded 97% after 10-16 days including an 8 day lag period in a test using a simulated activated sludge procedure(3). In a test using adapted activated sludge (20-day acclimation), 96.5% removal based upon dissolved organic carbon was observed after 5 days(4). In the Zahn-Wellens test, 97% dissolved organic carbon was removed in 14 days(6)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a river die-away test, 4-chloroaniline (10 ppm) degraded slowly in Nile River water over a period of 2 months but on redose increasingly larger concentrations of the chemical were degraded in shorter and shorter times so that on the 8th redose 100 ppm was degraded in a few days(6). No 4-chloroaniline (18.8 and 0.48 mg/L) degraded in 103 days at 15 \u00b0C in a shake flask screening test using natural sea water(5). However, in simulation tests performed at the same temperature and with the same sea water, but at very low concns, 1 and 4 ug/L, first order rate constants (half-lives) of 0.0073/day (95 day) and 0.0076/day (91 day), respectively were obtained(5). Several studies were performed where labeled 4-chloroaniline was incubated with soil(3,4,7). In one study, 12-17% mineralization occurred in 16 weeks with the maximum rate of degradation occurring between 1 and 3 weeks(7). 86% of the labeled residue was present as unextractable material bound to the soil and 1-4% of the residues were extractable(7). 14C-Labeled 4-chloroaniline was added to autoclaved and nonautoclaved soils and incubated for 6 weeks(4). No CO2 evolution was observed in the sample using autoclaved soil(4).  In the nonautoclaved samples, CO2 could be detected at 7.5% of the originally applied radioactivity for 4-chloroaniline(4). In a third study, 14-C labeled 4-chloroaniline was found to degrade 8.5 and 9.0% to CO2 after 16 weeks of incubation in two soils(3). It has been suggested that the binding of the chloroaniline to soil may extend its life in soil to 10 years(1). During composting with refuse, 14% of the 4-chloroaniline was metabolized in 21 days(2)."

            "Value": "/It was/ proposed that the methemoglobin bound with aniline compounds (e.g., p-chloroaniline) or their reactive metabolites is broken down in the red pulp of the spleen and the reactive metabolites are released, binding to splenic mesenchymal tissues and resulting in fibrosis, which progresses to the formation of splenic tumors. /Another study/ suggested that the splenic tumors are a result of erythrocyte toxicity. The damaged erythrocytes are scavenged by the spleen, where they cause vascular congestion, hyperplasia, fibrosis, and tumors. Whether the mechanism of carcinogenesis is mediated through genotoxic or non-genotoxic events is resolved. p-Chloroaniline is genotoxic in vitro but appears to be dependent on metabolism for its full expression. There is one positive study in vivo (micronucleus test), but this was positive only at a dose level in the range of the LD50."

            "Value": "The Koc for 5 Belgium soils ranged from 230-469(1). The adsorption isotherm was not linear and the exponent in the Freundlich adsorption isotherm averaged 0.70(1). The Koc for 5 German soils ranged from 96 to 1,530 with the Freundlich exponent ranging from 0.92 to 1.23(2). From adsorption studies on three soils with radically different organic carbon and clay contents, it was shown that the percent (14)C labeled 4-choloroaniline that was bound increased with the organic carbon content of the soil and decreased with its clay content(3). Stronger binding at low concns, particularly with the soil of low organic carbon content, suggests that there are a limited number of available binding sites on the soil(3). At the lower concn (5ppm), percent binding ranged from 46-78%(3). The Koc to colloidal organic matter in ground water was high, 5,550, suggesting that adsorption onto this microparticulate matter could effectively increase the solubility and leaching of 4-chloroaniline into landfill groundwater(4). According to a classification scheme(5), Koc values between 50-150 suggest that 4-chloroaniline is expected to have high mobility in soil, Koc values >500 to >5000 suggest 4-chloroaniline is expected to have low to no mobility in soil. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(7,8), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Adsorption of 4-chloroaniline by 5 soils was studied in the lab; adsorption decreased with the depth of the soil sample, due to decreased organic carbon(6). Adsorption coefficients of 4-chloroaniline and 4 other organic compounds for organic and inorganic materials and natural soils were determined(2). With few exceptions, the organic constituents of the soils were mainly responsible for their adsorption properties(2). Cellulose appeared to be a well-suited model adsorbent for simulating the relative adsorption behavior of the chemicals(2). The pKa of 4-chloroaniline is 3.98(9), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment."

            "Value": "Aromatic amines form covalent bonds with humic materials, adding to model quinoidal structures such as are found in humic materials, followed by slow oxidation to nitrogen-substituted quinoidal rings(1,6). Condensation with hydroquinones to form phenoxazines is another mechanism for incorporating anilines into humic substances(6). The reaction half-life of 4-chloroaniline with one test humic constituent was 13 min(1). Hybrid oligomers were formed between 4-chloroanline and carboxyphenolic humus constituents(2,5). These oxidative coupling reactions are mediated by biotic and abiotic catalysts, such as microbial and plant enzymes, inorganic chemicals, clay and soil extracts with MnO2 and enzymes having the strongest catalytic effect(5,6). This type of crosscoupling product would explain the fast, strong, and irreversible binding of anilines to soil(3). After 1 year, 10-20% of (14)C residues remained in the upper 10 cm of soil(3). Another field experiment using (14)C resulted in 30% of the label remaining where it was applied, while little was found at lower depths or in leachate(4)."

Three soils of varying organic matter and clay concentrations complexed 10% of applied 4-chloroaniline; extractable radioactivity incr and tightly complexed 4-chloroaniline decreased as organic matter concn decreased and clay concn increased.
