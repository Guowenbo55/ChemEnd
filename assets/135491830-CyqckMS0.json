Haloxyfop was the only herbicide where recovery decreased between the 3-and 48-h interval. All plants absorbed more of the herbicide at the 48-h interval than at the 3- or 6-h interval under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. Increased drought stress caused more acropetal movement with fluazifop and sethoxydim and less acropetal movement with quizalofop at the 3-h interval. Basipetal transloation, although different among herbicides, responded similarly to imposed moisture stress, which decreased basipetal translocation approximately 19%.",

It was found that safflower, soybean, linseed, and sunflower oils increased the foliar absorption and translocation of 14C more than palm oil but less than petroleum oil when applied without an emulsifier. The presence of an emulsifier in the oil additive enhanced 14C absorption and translocation, especially in soybean oil, making the absorption and translocation similar to petroleum oil with emulsifiers. The effect of emulsifier concentration on 14C absorption and translocation was more pronounced in soybean oil compared to petroleum oil, but the increase plateaued at around 15% with either oil. The percentage of 14C absorbed and translocated in oats increased with increasing soybean oil application rate but varied with the rate of sethoxydim application, suggesting a complex interaction between oil type, emulsifier, and herbicide concentration on absorption and translocation in oat plants.",
