However, information about the transfer and cell diffusion characteristics of pesticides in vegetables is insufficient. In this study, we investigated the uptake, translocation, and subcellular distribution behaviors of four commonly used pesticides in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) under laboratory hydroponic conditions. Root uptake of pesticides followed the order of fenbuconazole > avermectin > thiamethoxam > spirotetramat. Thiamethoxam was more readily translocated from the root to the shoot, while spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin preferentially accumulated in the root. Cell soluble components were the dominant storage compartment for thiamethoxam, while the majority of spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin were partitioned into the cell walls. These findings contribute to our understanding of pesticide bioconcentration behavior in food crops and help in evaluating the threats of pesticide residues to human health via the food chain.",

The dissipation of the three compounds in soil followed the first-order kinetics and DFZ showed greater half-lives than IMI and THX. Detection of the three compounds in rice tissues indicated that rice plants could take up and accumulate these pesticides. The concentrations of IMI and THX detected in leaves (IMI,10.0 and 410 mg/kg dw; THX, 23.0 and 265 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in roots (IMI,1.37 and 69.3 mg/kg dw; THX, 3.19 and 30.6 mg/kg dw), which differed from DFZ. The DFZ concentrations in roots (15.6 and 79.1 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in leaves (0.23 and 3.4 mg/kg dw). The bioconcentration factor (BCF), representing the capability of rice to accumulate contaminants from soil into plant tissues, ranged from 1.9 to 224.3 for IMI, from 2.0 to 72.3 for THX, and from 0.4 to 3.2 for DFZ at different treated concentrations. Much higher BCFs were found for IMI and THX at 10FR treatment than those at FR treatment, however, the BCFs of DFZ at both treatments were similar. The translocation factors (TFs), evaluating the capability of rice to translocate contaminants from the roots to the aboveground parts, ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 for stems and from 0.02 to 9.0 for leaves. The tested compounds were poorly translocated from roots to stems, with a TF below 1. However, IMI and THX were well translocated from roots to leaves. Clothianidin (CLO), the main metabolite of THX, was detected at the concentrations from 0.02 to 0.5 mg kg 1 in soil and from 0.07 to 7.0 mg kg 1 inplants.
