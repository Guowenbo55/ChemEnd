In a field study, water from a down gradient well below a coal distillation plant showed a 76% concentration reduction (after corrections for dispersion were made) compared with near surface water(10). o-Cresol is reported to degrade in soil but no rates were given(11). The disproportionate decrease in concn of o-cresol in groundwater down-gradient from a wood preserving facility has been ascribed to biodegradation(12). o-Cresol was completely degraded in 20 days using groundwater obtained from a gasoline-contaminated aquifer incubated under aerobic conditions(13). The half-life of o-cresol in southern California coastal waters was reported as 50 days(14). Pure cultures isolated from reed-sedge peat bogs completely degraded o-cresol during a 48 hour incubation period(15). The first-order aerobic biodegradation rate constant of o-cresol was reported as 0.0023/day(16), corresponding to a half-life of about 305 days(SRC). Biodegradation half-lives of 1.6 and 5.1 days were reported for 2 agricultural soils(17)."
