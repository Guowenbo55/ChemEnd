The suppression of terbutryne degradation in the fumigated soil was still evident 8 months after fumigation, similar to the behavior found in autoclaved soil(2). Addition of fungicides also strongly inhibited the degradation of terbutryne in soil(2). These observations suggest that biodegradation accounted for the majority of the terbutryne degradation in soil in these experiments(2).

Terbutryne had a degradation half-life of 18.2 days following a 40 day lag phase in Nile River water and a 6.9 day half-life after a 38 day lag phase in Nile River water with domestic settled sewage added(2). Terbutryne was applied to 2 farm ponds (A and C) near Winnipeg, Canada, in June 1978 to give 100 ug/L water concentrations(3). The half-life for terbutryne in the ponds ranged from 3 wk in pond C, which contained growths of cattails and duckweed to 30 days in pond A which was free from aquatic macrophytes(3).  Biological oxidation of the methylthio-sulfur in terbutryne may occur based upon the report that the methylthio group of the structurally similar herbicide prometryne is oxidized by soil microorganisms to the sulfoxide and sulfone(4). Adaptation and enrichment of viable microbial populations may be necessary for the degradation of methylthio-s-triazines such as terbutryne(5)."

Terbutryn stimulated both phosphatases, whereas prometryn stimulated only the phosphodiesterase. Atrazine desmetryn, prometon, and simazine inhibited acid phosphatase. No effect was exerted by ametryn. The enzyme assays and the kinetic parameters demonstrated that the interferences observed were due to an action on the synthesis of one or both enzymes rather than on the enzyme reactions. The types of the N-alkyl and the chlorine-subsitutuent groups in the structures of the s-triazines tested appear important in determing the degree of the interference."

Adsorption of 96-98% and 86-97%, respectively, of the terbutryne applied to an unlimed and limed silt loam soil has been observed(2). Evidence has been reported that indicates that the basicity of s-triazine herbicides, such as terbutryne, is not the main factor governing adsorption to soil humic acids(3). It has been shown that the ability of s-triazines herbicides to act as electron donors to electron acceptor quinone-like units of humic acids also plays an important role in the adsorption(4). Adsorption of terbutryne is favored in soils containing higher concn of clay and organic matter and leaching is limited by adsorption to certain soil constituents(5). Adsorption is reversible and desorption can occur readily depending on conditions including temperature, moisture, and pH(5). Simulated field conditions for a loam soil (pH 7.8, 63.4% sand, 24.6% silt, 12.0% clay, 1.01% organic matter), under saturated field conditions and an application rate of 10 kg/ha of terbutryne gave leaching results of; 5.25, 0.30, 0.03, <0.01, and <0.01 ppm at depths of 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 18, 18 to 24, and 24 to 30 cm, respectively, after 10 days(6).

Bioassay studies showed sorghum to be tolerant and wheat susceptible to terbutryn. Absorption and translocation of uniform 14C-labeled terbutryn from 1 to 24 hr after initial treatment showed the roots of sorghum and the foliage of wheat to be the major sites of radioactivity accumulation. Foliage was the major site for propazine accumulation with both plant species. Thin-layer chromatography of extracts from terbutryn-treated plants showed that sorghum contained a higher percentage of metabolic breakdown products in the foliage than did the root systems, and wheat contained a high percentage of intact terbutryn in the foliage and roots. High temperature (32 C) enhanced translocation of terbutryn and propazine in both sorghum and wheat. The susceptibility of wheat and sorghum to terbutryn appears to be correlated with a combination of the factors of accumulation within the foliage of the plant and the ability to degrade the terbutryn molecule.",
