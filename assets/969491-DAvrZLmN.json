Similar incidents have been reported in buzzards and kestrels because they ate wood-pigeons which had consumed dieldrin-treated grain. Suspected dieldrin poisoning has also been reported in Australian pelicans. The use of wood shavings from dieldrin-treated timber as floor and nest-box litter has caused a fall in egg production and increased mortality in chickens. Dietary ingestion of dieldrin can result in residues in the body fat and eggs, and the latter are unaffected by the dietary inclusion of phenobarbitone or charcoal."

Twenty grams of dorsal fish muscle were extracted and the residues analyzed by GLC; reagent blanks and spike samples were included with each sample. The waters from which the fish were obtained receive drainage from industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Water samples were not assayed for specific components. Assays for dieldrin indicated it was present in all fish. There were marked differences in the distribution in the different size groups studied, but concentration increased with size. Sphyraena sphyraena from Abu Qir Bay contained the highest (11.3 ug/kg) amount of dieldrin and Tilapia nilotica (Idku Lake) contained the lowest (0.74 ug/kg) amount of dieldrin.

These findings from our earlier studies are extended here to in vivo investigations relating convulsant action to inhibition of the t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding site in poisoned mice. Radioligand binding assays involved brain P2 membranes washed three times with 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to remove endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid or other modulators(s) which otherwise serves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of (35)S t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding at the gamma-aminobutyric acid-regulated chloride ionophore. Examination of lindane, technical toxaphene, toxaphene toxicant A, and 10 polychlorocyclodiene insecticides revealed 62% + or- 4% binding site inhibition 30 min after their LD50 doses with 32 + or - 3% inhibition at one half and 6 + or - 3% inhibition at one-quarter of their LD50 doses. This correlation between binding site inhibition and convulsant action is also evident in dose and time dependency studies with endosulfan sulfate. The brain P2 membranes of treated mice contain the parent compound with each of the polychlorocycloalkanes plus activation products of some of the cyclodienes, ie endosulfan sulfate from alpha- and beta-endosulfan and 12-ketoendrin from isodrin and endrin. The finding that the brains of treated mice contain sufficient polychlorocycloalkane or its activation products to achieve a magnitude of (35)S t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding site inhibition correlated with the severity of the poisoning signs supports the hypothesis that the acute toxicity of polychlorocycloalkane insecticides to mammals is due to disruption of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-regulated chloride ionophore."

At the second laparotomy, adenomas were seen in some animals in which there had been no tumor at the first laparotomy. In the animals in the continuous dieldrin treatment group, there was histological progression from adenoma to hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in some animals autopsied at 2 yr of age. A strong tendency to tumor progression was found in both treated & control mice."

Leiomyomas develop in the uterine myometrium & are sensitive to ovarian hormones, making them potential target sites for endocrine disruptors. Here we utilize cell lines derived from rat uterine leiomyomas to determine if a panel of 7 organochlorine pesticides have potential agonist activity in myometrial cells using cellular & molecular in vitro assays. The organochlorine pesticides investigated have been previously characterized as having agonist activity in other hormonally responsive tissues, but their effects have not been studied in uterine myometrial cells. In Eker rat leiomyoma-derived cells, HPTE, kepone, & the alpha isomer of endosulfan stimulated proliferation, an effect dampened by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. In addition, these cmpds stimulated transcription of the vitellogenin estrogen-response element via the ER in a transcriptional reporter gene assay & induced the expression of an endogenous estrogen-responsive gene, the progesterone receptor (PR). This contrasted with the agonist profile of methoxychlor, dieldrin, toxaphene, & endosulfan-beta. These cmpds, unable to stimulate proliferation of uterine leiomyoma cells, did exhibit agonistic activity in these cells at the transcriptional level in the estrogen-sensitive reporter gene assay, & they were also able to upregulate PR message. These data demonstrate that organochlorine pesticides act as estrogen receptor agonists in Eker rat uterine myometrial cells, & they indicate a need for further investigation of the potential tissue-specific agonist activity of these pesticides & their role in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma."

To understand the persistent organic pollutant uptake mechanisms of plant species, we compared the dieldrin absorption and transportation potentials of several plants in hydroponic medium. Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Moench), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), soybean (Glycine max), komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. peruviridis), white-flowered gourd (Lagenaria siceraria var. hispida), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) were grown in a dieldrin-added hydroponic medium for 10 d, and then the amount of dieldrin in their shoots and roots was measured. All of the roots contained dieldrin, whereas only the cucurbits (white-flowered gourd, cucumber, and zucchini) contained considerable amounts of dieldrin in their shoots. The dieldrin uptake to the roots depended on the concentration of the n-hexane soluble components in the roots, regardless of whether the dieldrin in the roots was translocated to shoots or not. The dieldrin uptake from the solution to the roots was thought to be due to a passive response, such as adsorption on the roots. The translocation of dieldrin from the roots to the shoots was probably through the xylems. The amounts of dieldrin in the shoots per transpiration rates were higher for cucurbits than for non-cucurbits. It seems likely that cucurbits have uptake mechanisms for hydrophobic organic chemicals.",
