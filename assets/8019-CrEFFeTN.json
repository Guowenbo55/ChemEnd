Embryos exposed to 2-ME had expanded areas of cell death in the neural crest and also new areas of cell death in medial regions of the anterior neural tube. Both physiological and 2-ME-induced embryonic cell death had morphological, immunohistochemical, and fluorochrome staining characteristics of apoptosis. When fluorescence data from confocal microscopic analysis of vital fluorochrome-stained embryos were analyzed, a dose-dependent increase was found in embryos exposed to 2-ME. Similar results were obtained when cell death was analyzed in either conventional histological sections or sections prepared for immunohistochemical detection of apoptosis."

They may cause testicular atrophy, decreased sperm motility, and an increased incidence of abnormal sperm. Most likely, the metabolism of monoalkyl glycol ethers occurs via alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, leading to the formation of methoxyacetic acid (MAA). MAA is believed to be the ultimate toxic metabolite of 2-ME. However, methoxyacetaldehyde (MALD), an intermediate metabolite of 2-ME,can also produce testicular lesions. Although the site of action was thought to be upon the late spermatocyte, it now appears that the Sertoli cells are the prime target for 2-ME. It is unclear whether the mechanism of testicular toxicity of 2-ME induces germ cell death by interfering with interregulating signal transduction pathways within either Sertoli cells or germ cells, causing a disruption of cell-to-cell communication."

In this study, the effects of 2-ME/2-MAA on brain differentiation were assessed soon after gd 8 treatment. Physiological cell death (CD) in control embryos and chemically-enhanced CD were compared by Nile blue sulfate staining (4, 8, 12 hr after 2-ME; 0, 250 or 325 mg/kg). Its intensity in fore-, mid- and hindbrain was scored as scattered, moderate or intense. These CD patterns were confirmed by propidium iodide fluorescence staining. The most consistent CD staining was observed 8 hr after 325 mg 2-ME/kg. In controls, scattered CD was apparent in the pros-, mes- and rhombencephalon, while moderate to intense CD appeared uniformly in the caudal rim of the open forebrain and along its midline when closure was occurring. In 2-ME exposed embryos, CD patterns in the forebrain were comparable to those in controls. However, CD in the mid- and hindbrains was markedly increased. Moderate to intense CD in about half of the embryos was observed in the mes- and rhombencephalon. Rhombomeres 1-3 and the dorsal lateral neural tube were particularly remarkable in their staining intensity. Neural tube closure status and brain morphology (250 mg 2-ME/kg) were evaluated on gd 9.25 and gd 10.25. The mean somite number was unaffected by 2-ME treatment. However, in control embryos the neuropores were closed in all but 1 of 119 embryos, while in 23% (35 of 142; 82% of litters) of 2-ME embryos they were patent, and 8% (11 of 133; 36% of litters) still had that condition on gd 10.25. For comparison other pregnancies progressed to gd 18 when 12% of the live fetuses (in 40% of litters) had EX. There were also numerous morphological differences from developmental-age-matched controls consistent with 2-MAA-induced embryotoxicity, which caused developmental delay. Its incidence on gd 9.25 was five times higher (embryos) and affected twice as many litters as in concurrent controls. On gd 10.25 twice as many embryos as in control litters still displayed this differentiation delay phenomenon."

On gd 8, CD-1 mice received a sc bolus dose of 250 mg 2-ME/kg or saline. Conceptuses were examined either on gd 9.25 for neural tube closure status (normally completed on gd 9.0) and gross alterations in brain shape, or on gd 18 for the presence of exencephaly. The number of 2-ME-exposed embryos with persistent patency of the anterior neuropore was significantly greater than that of gd 18 fetuses with exencephaly (25% of embryos vs. 13% of fetuses, 83% vs. 40% of litters). Control conceptuses had no exencephaly on gd 18, but 1% had open neuropores on gd 9.25. There were no differences in resorption rates between any of the groups. In 2-ME-exposed embryos with closed neuropores, brain vesicles were underdeveloped and not well defined compared to controls. These observations indicate that 2-ME (1) delayed neural tube closure, (2) raised the incidence of total failure to close, and (3) adversely affected early brain development."

The suppressive effects of 2MAA were more pronounced in rat lymphocytes. The effects of 2MAAD were comparable in both species. 2ME had no effect on the IgG or IgM antibody responses in either mouse or rat lymphocytes. Since the antibody response of the lymphocytes was not directly affected by 2ME, hepatocyte and lymphocyte cocultures were established and treated with 0 to 50 mM 2ME to determine if the hepatocytes would metabolize 2ME to 2MAA or 2MAAD which would, in turn, suppress the IgM antibody response. The IgM antibody response of mouse lymphocytes was suppressed by 12.5 to 50 mM 2ME in the presence of mouse lymphocytes and by 25 to 50 mM 2ME in the presence of rat lymphocytes.

Cell death was induced in the mesenchymal tissue and to some extent in the limb bud ectoderm, including the apical ectodermal ridge in a dose-related manner. The area of preaxial physiological cell necrosis was enlarged by EGME, and the shape of the limb buds was altered 24 hr after treatment. Preaxial tissue and the predigital chondrocyte condensations were reduced or missing following 250 and 350 mg EGME per kg. Light and electron microscope evaluations of forelimb buds revealed the presence of phagocytic vacuoles and condensed, fragmented cytoplasm, which indicate cytotoxicity, as early as 2 hr following EGME, a maximum effect being observed 6 hr after the dose was administered. Although the severity of the cytotoxic response appeared to be dose-related, comparison with the incidence of digital malformations in near-term fetuses indicates that the loss of mesenchymal tissue is partially compensated for as formation of the limb progresses."

MAA primarily affects tissues with rapidly dividing cells and high rates of energy metabolism, including testes, thymus and the fetus. Testicular toxicity, one of the most prominent consequences of EGME, and MAA, exposure, results from apoptosis of primary spermatocytes and is associated with changes in the expression of various genes and signaling pathways. This review of EGME metabolism and its organ-specific toxicities emphasizes genes and signaling pathways that are modulated by EGME exposure and their relevance to the molecular mechanisms underlying EGME and MAA toxicity. Of particular importance are the genes that code for oxidative stress response factors, protein kinases, and nuclear hormone receptors. Nuclear receptors and protein kinases regulate multiple cellular processes and are critical for signaling events required for spermatogenesis. De-regulation of their activity by EGME or MAA leads to inappropriate signaling in testicular cells. Oxidative stress in spermatocytes exposed to MAA triggers mitochondrial release of cytochrome C, activation of caspases and ultimately apoptosis. ..."

The aim of this study was to define the pathways by which these compounds exerted their effects on the ovary and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In the ovary, changes in the steroidogenic activity of new and old corpora lutea (CL) were addressed. EGME (300 mg/kg), sulpiride (100 mg/kg), or atrazine (300 mg/kg) were orally given daily for four times from proestrus to diestrus in normal cycling rats. Treatment with all chemicals significantly increased serum P4 levels, and EGME as well as sulpiride induced increases in prolactin (PRL) levels. In new CL, at the gene and the protein levels, all three chemicals upregulated the following steroidogenic factors: scavenger receptor class B type I, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage, and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and downregulated the luteolytic gene, 20alpha-HSD. Coadministration of EGME and bromocriptine, a D2 agonist, completely inhibited PRL but not P4 secretion. Additionally, steroidogenic factor expression levels were upregulated, and 20alpha-HSD level was downregulated in new CL. These results suggest that EGME both directly and indirectly stimulates P4 production in luteal cells, whereas sulpiride elevates P4 through activation of PRL secretion in the pituitary. Atrazine may directly activate new CL by stimulating steroidogenic factor expressions. The present study suggests that multiple pathways mediate the effects of EGME, sulpiride, and atrazine on the HPG axis and luteal P4 production in female rats in vivo."

To understand the molecular basis of this action on meiotic prophase cells, mRNA differential display was used to identify gene expression changes in control and treated cells. When pachytene spermatocytes were cultured with 5 mM ME or 5 mM MAA for 24 hr, two complementary DNAs (cDNAs), of 557 nucleotides (clone 5) and 388 nucleotides (clone 6), were up-regulated; and a cDNA of 648 nucleotides (clone 1) was down-regulated. The altered expression pattern shown by differential display was confirmed by Northern blotting. Sequence analyses indicate that clones 1 and 6 have 83% and 79% homology at the nucleotide level to a polo-like kinase (SRP: important regulators of the cell cycle) and a thiol-specific antioxidant, respectively. Clone 5 shows no homology to any known gene in the database. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the thiol-specific antioxidant and clone 5 are up-regulated within 30 min of the addition of MAA, whereas the polo-like kinase mRNA decreased to undetectable levels after 6 hr. Changes in Sertoli cell gene expression were also detected when Sertoli cells were cultured with 5 mM ME or MAA for 24 hr. Two cDNAs, of 367 nucleotides (clone 2) and 676 nucleotides (clone 3), were up-regulated; and a cDNA of 538 nucleotides (clone 4) was down-regulated. Homology searches revealed that clones 3 and 4 have 90 and 91% homology at the nucleotide level to an oxidative stress protein and a phosphodiesterase (PDE), respectively.

To determine whether the changes in gene expression seen with cells in culture also occur in vivo, rats were given a single oral dose of 250 mg/kg ME or MAA. After 24 hr, total testis RNAs from control and treated rats were purified and hybridized. The expression patterns seen in vivo for the differentially expressed cDNAs were identical to those seen in vitro. /The study/ conclude that, although pachytene spermatocytes seem to be selectively affected by ME and MAA, changes in gene expression are also detected in Sertoli cells, suggesting that the action(s) of ME or MAA on pachytene spermatocytes could be mediated through Sertoli cells."

Organs with high metabolism and rapid cell division, such as testes, are especially sensitive to its actions. In order to gain mechanistic understanding of EGME-induced toxicity, an untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed in rats. Male rats were administrated with EGME at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. At days 1, 4, and 14, serum, urine, liver, and testes were collected for analysis. Testicular injury was observed at day 14 of the 100 mg/kg/day group only. Nearly 1900 metabolites across the four matrices were profiled using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis indicated that the most significant metabolic perturbations initiated from the early time points by EGME were the inhibition of choline oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways, leading to the accumulation of sarcosine, dimethylglycine, and various carnitine- and glycine-conjugated metabolites. Pathway mapping of these altered metabolites revealed that all the disrupted steps were catalyzed by enzymes in the primary flavoprotein dehydrogenase family, suggesting that inhibition of flavoprotein dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions may represent the mode of action for EGME-induced toxicity. Similar urinary and serum metabolite signatures are known to be the hallmarks of multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency in humans, a genetic disorder because of defects in primary flavoprotein dehydrogenase reactions. /The study/ postulate that disruption of key biochemical pathways utilizing flavoprotein dehydrogenases in conjugation with downstream metabolic perturbations collectively result in the EGME-induced tissue damage."

The major findings are: (1) MAA significantly increases the protein-protein interactions of skeletal proteins in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.001), while 2-ME has no effect (at even a 2.5-fold higher concentration). Addition of MAA leads to significant increase in the rotational motion of spin-labeled terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues (2.0 mM MAA, 38% decrease of the apparent rotational correlation time tau a, P < 0.01). The rotational motion of spin-labeled sialic acid, 70% of which is on the major transmembrane sialoglycoprotein (glycophorin A or PAS 1), was not affected by MAA treatment. MAA has no effect on the lipid bilayer fluidity, since no change in the motion of a lipid bilayer specific spin label (5-NS) in the erythrocyte membrane was observed. These results suggest that MAA may lead to teratologic toxicity by interacting not with lipid components but with certain, perhaps specific, protein components, i.e., transport proteins, cytoskeleton proteins or neurotransmitter receptors."

Similarly, 2-EE inhibited dye transfer, although myometrial cells were less sensitive to 2-EE compared to 2-ME. Dye transfer returned to control levels after 2 hr in the continued presence of 2-ME. The primary metabolite of 2-ME, methoxyacetic acid (MAA), had no effect on dye transfer at concentrations equimolar to 2-ME. Because 2-ME and 2-EE inhibited gap junctional communication only at high concentrations and because the inhibition reversed in the continued presence of the compounds, it is suggested that glycol ethers delay parturition by a mechanism independent of a direct action on myometrial gap junctions."

            "Value": "Embryotoxicity of glycol ethers is caused by their alkoxyacetic acid metabolites, but the mechanism underlying the embryotoxicity of these acid metabolites is so far not known. The present study investigates a possible mechanism underlying the embryotoxicity of glycol ether alkoxyacetic acid metabolites using the methoxyacetic acid (MAA) metabolite of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether as the model compound. The results obtained demonstrate an MAA-induced decrease of the intracellular pH (pH(i)) of embryonic BALB/c-3T3 cells as well as of embryonic stem (ES)-D3 cells, at concentrations that affect ES-D3 cell differentiation. These results suggest a mechanism for MAA-mediated embryotoxicity similar to the mechanism of embryotoxicity of the drugs valproic acid and acetazolamide (ACZ), known to decrease the pH(i)in vivo, and therefore used as positive controls. The embryotoxic alkoxyacetic acid metabolites ethoxyacetic acid, butoxyacetic acid and phenoxyacetic acid also caused an intracellular acidification of BALB/c-3T3 cells at concentrations that are known to inhibit ES-D3 cell differentiation. Two other embryotoxic compounds, all-trans-retinoic acid and 5-fluorouracil, did not decrease the pH(i) of embryonic cells at concentrations that affect ES-D3 cell differentiation, pointing at a different mechanism of embryotoxicity of these compounds. MAA and ACZ induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ES-D3 cell differentiation, which was enhanced by amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+)-antiporter, corroborating an important role of the pH(i) in the embryotoxic mechanism of both compounds. Together, the results presented indicate that a decrease of the pH(i) may be the mechanism of embryotoxicity of the alkoxyacetic acid metabolites of the glycol ethers."

Rats dermally exposed to ME and immunized with either SRBC or TNP-LPS had a decreased ability to produce primary antibodies to these antigens. Rats orally administered ME followed by immunization with SRBC or TNP-LPS also had suppressed antibody formation. The results indicated that dermally applied ME altered immune function. A surprising result was the enhancement of mitogen stimulated LP responses of splenocytes in rats exposed dermally or orally to high ME doses, which may be stress related. ...The immune sensitivity to ME seen in rats raises the possibility that immune functions are altered in humans exposed to ME."

EGME is metabolized to the active compound methoxy-acetic acid (MAA), which readily crosses the placenta and impairs fetal development. However, little is known about the effect of maternal EGME exposure on the development of fetal immunity. In the present report, in utero treatment with EGME was found to alter expression of murine thymocyte and liver fetal cell-surface markers. Pregnant mice were exposed to 100, 150, or 200 mg/kg EGME from gestational days (gd) 10 to 17 and offspring examined on gd 18. Significant thymic atrophy and cellular depletion were found in EGME-exposed fetal mice. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that EGME treatment resulted in decreased percentages of CD4+8+ thymocytes and increased percentages of CD4-8- thymocytes. In vitro exposure to MAA did not result in decreased thymocyte viability or proliferation. These data suggest that EGME, in addition to producing thymic hypocellularity, may inhibit thymocyte maturation. EGME also reduced the percentage of CD45+ leukocytic cells present in fetal liver, an alteration that appeared to be largely manifested by decreased numbers of CD45R+ and CD44dim prolymphoid cells. In vitro MAA exposure of fetal liver cells enriched for lymphoid precursors resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation. Reconstitution of irradiated hosts with gd 18 fetal liver cells from vehicle and EGME-exposed syngeneic donors demonstrated impaired ability of the EGME-treated fetal liver to repopulate the host spleen with B or T lymphocytes. These data suggest that EGME-induced immunosuppression may result from targeting of multiple hematopoietic compartments. Further, the present data indicate that fetal liver prolymphocytes may represent sensitive targets of EGME exposure."

A concentration of 100% of ME was lethal to all mothers, 30% was lethal to fetuses, and 10% caused a decrease in the litter size and a decrease in survival rate. A concentration of 3% had no adverse effects. Using this in vivo technique, it was estimated that a concentration of 10% ME is potentially teratogenic in the rat."

The present study investigates a possible mechanism underlying the embryotoxicity of glycol ether alkoxyacetic acid metabolites using the methoxyacetic acid (MAA) metabolite of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether as the model compound. The results obtained demonstrate an MAA-induced decrease of the intracellular pH (pH(i)) of embryonic BALB/c-3T3 cells as well as of embryonic stem (ES)-D3 cells, at concentrations that affect ES-D3 cell differentiation. These results suggest a mechanism for MAA-mediated embryotoxicity similar to the mechanism of embryotoxicity of the drugs valproic acid and acetazolamide (ACZ), known to decrease the pH(i)in vivo, and therefore used as positive controls. The embryotoxic alkoxyacetic acid metabolites ethoxyacetic acid, butoxyacetic acid and phenoxyacetic acid also caused an intracellular acidification of BALB/c-3T3 cells at concentrations that are known to inhibit ES-D3 cell differentiation. Two other embryotoxic compounds, all-trans-retinoic acid and 5-fluorouracil, did not decrease the pH(i) of embryonic cells at concentrations that affect ES-D3 cell differentiation, pointing at a different mechanism of embryotoxicity of these compounds. MAA and ACZ induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ES-D3 cell differentiation, which was enhanced by amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+)-antiporter, corroborating an important role of the pH(i) in the embryotoxic mechanism of both compounds. Together, the results presented indicate that a decrease of the pH(i) may be the mechanism of embryotoxicity of the alkoxyacetic acid metabolites of the glycol ethers."

A well-known ovarian toxicant, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), was administered to female rats at dose levels of 0, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg for 2 or 4 weeks (repeated-dose toxicity studies). The same doses were administered to female rats for 2 weeks prior to mating, during mating, and until Day 6 of pregnancy (fertility study). In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, continuous diestrus was observed at > or = 100 mg/kg regardless of period of administration. The alterations of ovarian morphology observed at > or = 100 mg/kg after 2 or 4 weeks of administration were characterized by hypertrophy of the corpora lutea with decreased cellular debris indicating apoptosis, and increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-negative large atretic follicles. The finding that newly-formed basophilic corpora lutea were scarce in affected animals exhibiting continuous diestrus suggested suppression of ovulation due to hypertrophic corpora lutea. In the fertility study, irregular estrous cycles, prolonged mating periods, lower pregnancy rates and decreased corpora lutea of pregnancy were observed at > or = 100 mg/kg. The irregularities of estrous cycle observed in some animals at 30 mg/kg were minimal. The ovarian histopathological changes in repeated-dose toxicity studies correlated well with impairment of female fertility found in the fertility study.

EAA was less potent than MAA whereas n-propoxy- and n-butoxyacetic acid, and methoxyacetylglycine, a further metabolite of MAA, produced no morphological changes under these conditions. The same order of toxicity was observed in concurrent studies with the four acids in rats. In culture, the severity of the morphological changes was paralleled by decreases in the activity of carnitine acetyltransferase and lactate dehydrogenase-X in the attached germ cell fraction.

MAAD and MAA suppressed IgM and IgG production by both mouse and rat lymphocytes at non-cytotoxic doses. However, ME had no effect on antibody production by either mouse or rat lymphocytes. Lower concentrations of MAA suppressed rat lymphocyte IgM and IgG production (at 0.5 and 1.0 mM MAA, respectively) compared with mouse lymphocytes (2.0 mM MAA). IgM and IgG production by both rat and mouse lymphocytes was suppressed at comparable concentrations of MAAD (0.3 mM MAAD). The role that metabolism of ME to its immunosuppressive forms plays in this in vitro suppression was demonstrated using hepatocyte-lymphocyte co-cultures. IgM production by both mouse and rat lymphocytes was suppressed at a lower concentration of ME following co-culture with mouse (12.5 mM ME) versus rat (25 and 50 mM ME) hepatocytes. These in vitro results indicate that rat lymphocytes are more sensitive to MAA than are mouse lymphocytes and that mouse hepatocytes have a greater capacity to metabolize ME to its immunosuppressive metabolites than do rat hepatocytes. In addition, MAAD is more immunotoxic than MAA, suggesting that this metabolite may be the proximate immunotoxicant.
