            "Value": "The interaction with neural neuropathy target esterase and acetylcholinesterase in vivo of methamidophos, its resolved stereoisomers and five higher O-alkyl homologs has been examined along with the ability of these cmpd to cause organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy in adult hens. For the lower homologs, acetylcholinesterase was more sensitive than neuropathy target esterase and it was impossible to achieve high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase in vivo without both prophylaxis and therapy against acute anticholinesterase effects; for the n-hexyl homolog high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase could be achieved without obvious anticholinesterase effects and spontaneous reactivation of inhibited acetycholinesterase was seen as in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose of L(-) methamidophos or of the ethyl- or isopropyl homologs did not inhibit neuropathy target esterase more than 60%, and surviving birds did not develop organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. The n-propyl, n-butyl and n-hexyl compounds caused typical organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy at doses causing a peak of 70-95% inhibition of neuropathy target esterase in brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve soon after dosing. Racemic methamidophos caused unusually mild organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy associated with very high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase at doses estimated to be > 8 times the unprotected LD50 and the D-(+) isomer caused organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy at about 5-7 times the LD50. Clinical effects correlated with histopathology in 19 out of 20 examined birds. In contrast to results of many previous studies with organophosphates and phosphonates, all these cases of organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy were associated with formation of inhibited neuropathy target esterase which could be reactivated ex vivo by treatment of autopsy tissue with KF solution. It is not clear whether aging of inhibited neuropathy target esterase had occurred but with less associated stabilization of the enzyme-phosphorus bond or whether, even without aging, the unusual N-unsubstituted phosphoramidate caused sufficient disturbance in or near the neuropathy target esterase target to initiate the same degenerative process as that caused typically by generation of aged organophosphorylated neuropathy target esterase."

For the Methamidophos (+) isomer, NTE was inhibited 98% at ten times the LD50 (400 mg/kg) with 86% of the inhibited NTE being reactivated in an unaged form. For the Methamidophos (-) isomer, NTE was inhibited by 58-84% at five times the LD50 (400 mg/kg) with 27% of the inhibited NTE being reactivated in an unaged form. Approximately 73% of the inhibited NTE was modified (aged). Based on the marked percentage of aged NTE, the (-) isomer could be considered a possible trigger for organophosphorus esterase-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP)."
