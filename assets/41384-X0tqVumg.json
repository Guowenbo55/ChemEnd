            "content": "Background: The insecticide carbosulfan is typically applied as a soil treatment or seed-coating agent, potentially being absorbed by crops and posing dietary risks. Understanding the uptake, metabolism, and translocation of carbosulfan in crops is crucial for its safe application. In this study, we investigated the distribution of carbosulfan and its toxic metabolites in maize plants at both the tissue and subcellular levels, and explored the uptake and translocation mechanism of carbosulfan.\nResults: Carbosulfan was mainly taken up by maize roots via the apoplastic pathway, preferentially distributed in cell walls (51.2%\u201357.0%), and mostly accumulated in roots with only weak upward translocation. Carbofuran, the main metabolite of carbosulfan in maize plants, was primarily stored in roots. However, carbofuran could be upwardly translocated to shoots and leaves due to its greater distribution in root-soluble components (24.4%\u201328.5%) compared with carbosulfan (9.7%\u201314.5%). This resulted from its greater solubility compared with its parent compound. The metabolite 3-hydroxycarbofuran was found in shoots and leaves.\nConclusion: Carbosulfan could be passively absorbed by maize roots, mainly via the apoplastic pathway, and transformed into carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran. Although carbosulfan mostly accumulated in roots, its toxic metabolites carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran could be detected in shoots and leaves. This implies that there is a risk in the use of carbosulfan as a soil treatment or seed coating.",

Nematode-resistant chickpea and tomato are lacking except for a few varieties, and therefore grower demand is not met. The available nematicides, namely, carbosulfan, cadusafos, phorate, and triazophos, were evaluated for their efficacy and persistence in soil and crops to devise nematode management decisions. In alluvial soil, cadusafos was the most persistent nematicide, followed by phorate, carbosulfan, and triazophos in that order. The percent dissipation of cadusafos was greater (P < 0.05) in chickpea than in tomato plots, which influenced its half-life in the soil. Nematicide residues were differentially taken up by chickpea and tomato plant roots, with active absorption continuing for up to 45 days. Cadusafos and triazophos were absorbed to a greater extent (P < 0.05) in tomato than in chickpea. The translocation of residues to the shoot was highest by day 15 for cadusafos and at day 45 for other nematicides, with carbosulfan residues translocated the most. Nematicide residue concentrations in shoots never exceeded those in roots, with residues in both roots and shoots persisting beyond 90 days. Nematicide residues in green seeds of chickpea and tomato fruits were all below the Codex/German MRLs of 0.02, including the Indian tolerances of 0.1 \u03bcg/g in fruits and vegetables. Cadusafos was found to be the most effective nematicide followed by triazophos against Meloidogyne incognita and reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis. Application of cadusafos (Rugby 10 G) or, alternatively, spray application of triazophos (Hostathion 40 EC) in planting furrows, both at 1.0 kg of active ingredient/ha, followed by light irrigation, is recommended for the effective control of M. incognita and R. reniformis infestations on chickpea and tomato.",
