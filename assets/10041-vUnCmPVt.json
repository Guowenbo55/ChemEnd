            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ ... The anesthetic effects of neopentane and other saturated hydrocarbons ... /were examined/ in mice. Neopentane caused light anesthesia in mice exposed to 200,000 ppm for 30 min and anesthesia (loss of posture) at 270,000 ppm for 3 min exposure. Neopentane was lethal to 40% of the mice exposed for 2 hr at a concentration of 340,000 ppm. After 2 hr of anesthesia, the surviving mice recovered quickly on average in 4 min. All mice that did not die during the period of anesthesia remained normal for the 24 to 48 hr observed after anesthesia. Neopentane was less anesthetic and less lethal than isopentane, which was less anesthetic and less lethal than n-pentane. ... This indicates that increased branching in the carbon backbone of a chemical reduces its toxicity. ... All of the substances /evaluated/ produced considerable excitement in mice during anesthesia. ... Neopentane differed from the others in causing still more excitement and a general cramp-like effect just before anesthesia was induced. During recovery from anesthesia, those recovering form neopentane showed marked hyperexcitability when stimulated by noise or touch."
