FROM A FIELD SOIL TREATED WITH DIURON AT THE RATE OF 1.76 KG/HA/YR FOR THE PAST 10 CONSECUTIVE YEARS, BLEIDNER DISTILLATION RECOVERED 1 PPM DCA, ALL FROM HUMIC COMPLEXES. THE MINERALIZATION RATE OF BOUND DCA AND THE DECLINE KINETICS OF DCA RECOVERY BOTH LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TOTAL BOUND DCA ACCUMULATION IN THE ANALYZED SOIL DID NOT EXCEED 2.5 PPM AND THAT IN SOILS OF THE EXAMINED TYPE, THE ACCUMULATION OF BOUND DCA RESIDUES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROBLEM."

            "Value": "A Koc value of 193 (log Koc= 2.29) was measured during a batch adsorption test with a silt loam soil(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that 3,4-dichloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Aromatic amines, including 3,4-dichloroaniline, have been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution. The initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone(3)."

            "content": "In a study investigating the metabolic fate of 3,4-dichloroaniline in soybean and wheat plants, researchers found that both plant species efficiently converted the xenobiotic compound into various metabolites, including glucosides, N-malonyl-3,4-dichloroaniline, and non-extractable residues. Notably, soybean plants exhibited significant translocation of these metabolites, primarily to hypocotyls and leaves, with N-malonyl-3,4-dichloroaniline being the dominant metabolite. In contrast, wheat plants retained a substantial portion of the absorbed 3,4-dichloroaniline in their roots, with a notable fraction transformed into non-extractable residues. These findings underscore the potential environmental impact of 3,4-dichloroaniline, a stable compound found in certain pesticides, and highlight distinct metabolic pathways in different plant species, providing valuable insights into xenobiotic metabolism in plants.",
