Hearts were perfused through the aorta. Left ventricular mechanical activity was monitored concurrently with action potentials recorded from left ventricular myocardial fibers. In the first series, mechanical performance curves were determined for each of 7 hearts using intraventricular balloons to control end diastolic pressure. The relative effectiveness of these compounds as negative inotropic agents was bromochlorodifluoromethane > dichlorodifluoromethane > bromotrifluoromethane. In the 2nd series of experiments, hearts were exposed to increasing concentrations of each fluorocarbon. Controls were exposed to equivalent concentrations of nitrogen. Exposure to increasing concentrations of bromotrifluoromethane decreased peak left ventricular pressure, the integral of the pressure curve, and the time to 20% repolarization of the action potential. Exposure to increasing concentrations of bromochlorodifluoromethane reduced peak left ventricular pressure, the maximal rate of rise of the pressure curve and prolonged exposure to increasing levels of dichlorodifluoromethane decreased peak left ventricular pressure and the maximal rate of rise of the pressure curve."

            "Value": "Seventeen beagle dogs representing both sexes and weighing an average of 10 kg each were used in open chest experiments. The dogs were anesthetized by the continuous iv infusion of a mixture of 10% ethanol and 60 mg/l morphine sulfate in 5% glucose in water. Left ventricular pressure was monitored through a metal canula inserted through the left ventricular free wall following a left side thoractomy. Left ventricular pressure was used to control the horizontal deflection and change in pressure with time was used to control the vertical deflection of a vector oscilloscope. Peak change in pressure with time divided by P was calculated from the Lissajous figures generated, and provided an index of the inotropic state of the left ventricular myocardium. The method was validated using isoproterenol and propranolol, known inotropic agents. Since bromotrifluoromethane and bromochlorodifluoromethane (components of fire extinguishing systems used in both environmental closed and open life support systems) cause changes in mean arterial pressure, the effects of variable afterload on peak change in pressure with time divided by P were determined by aortic constriction. Both fluoroalkanes produced concentration-dependent decreases in peak change in pressure with time divided by P that reflected decreased myocardial contractility."

            "Value": "Thirty-four mongrel dogs were divided into 5 groups: 6 oxygen controls; 8 exposed to 27-75% bromotrifluoromethane in oxygen; 4 exposed to 27-75% nitrogen and oxygen; 9 exposed to 4-12% bromochlorodifluoromethane in oxygen; and 7 exposed to 0.3-1.0% chlorobromomethane in oxygen. Dogs were anesthetized and instruments for cardiovascular dynamic and myocardial metabolic monitoring through thoracotomies were implanted. Thirty-eight variables reflecting cardiovascular dynamics and myocardial metabolism were monitored before, during and after 45-min exposures to the respective compounds. The results of the exposures to the halogenated alkanes were compared with the results from the oxygen experiments except where significant differences were detected between oxygen and nitrogen exposures reflecting effects of oxygen exclusion, in which case the results of the corresponding fluorocarbon exposures were compared with the results from the nitrogen exposures. The most significant observation was the elevation of the coronary sinus blood oxygen partial pressure and oxygen content during exposure to bromochlorodifluoromethane or chlorobromomethane. Both of these variables increased in magnitude progressively during the exposures. The persistence of the effect postexposure was greater for bromochlorodifluoromethane than for chlorobromomethane. Exposure to bromotrifluoromethane, bromochlorodifluoromethane or chlorobromomethane may result in disturbances of myocardial energy metabolism that are connected to myocardial performance. Based on the concentration to which dogs must be exposed to elicit such responses, bromotrifluoromethane was least effective and chlorobromomethane was most effective. The bromochlorodifluoromethane was intermediate between the two but closer to the chlorobromomethane than to the bromotrifluoromethane."
