Thus, three dose levels were tested in the definitive chromosome aberration test at intervals of 100%, 50% and 25% of the maximum dose of 5000 mg/kg.  None of the three dose levels of tetraethylene glycol tested produced statistically significant or dose related increases in relative numbers of chromosome aberrations compared to control values with either male or female Sprague-Dawley rats. Simple chromatid breaks and fragments were the predominant types of aberrations observed and the frequencies of these aberrations were within the range of the spontaneous incidence for this test system at this laboratory. Thus, tetraethylene glycol was not considered to be clastogenic (chromosome breaking) to Sprague-Dawley rats under the conditions of this vivo test system."

The results indicate that in CHEL cells only TEG and PEG 200 are clastogenic. Parallel experiments performed in CHO cells in the presence and absence of rat liver S9 mix showed significant increases in chromosomal aberrations only in cultures treated with TEG in the presence of rat liver S9, indicating that low molecular weight polymers need to be activated to exert their genotoxic activity."
