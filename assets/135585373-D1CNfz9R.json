            "content": "Tepraloxydim, a herbicide, was found to be highly effective against annual bluegrass (Poa annua), a weed species that is relatively tolerant to sethoxydim, another herbicide. The absorption and translocation rates of tepraloxydim and sethoxydim were higher in P. annua compared to Setaria faberi, but the absorption and translocation patterns of tepraloxydim in both plants were similar to those of sethoxydim. The metabolic rates of tepraloxydim and sethoxydim in P. annua and S. faberi were also similar. Tepraloxydim showed a strong inhibition of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase), a key enzyme in plant lipid synthesis, with an I50 concentration of approximately 3 x 10-6 mol L-1 for P. annua and 7 x 10-7 mol L-1 for S. faberi. In contrast, sethoxydim had an I50 of 2 x 10-6 mol L-1 for ACCase from S. faberi but showed only slight effects on ACCase activity from P. annua even at 10-4 mol L-1. The difference in ACCase inhibition is believed to be the major factor contributing to the high herbicidal activity of tepraloxydim against P. annua. The herbicidal activity against P. annua was significantly influenced by the length of the alkyl chain at position R2 in the tepraloxydim molecule, with a P/S ratio (ratio of the I50 dose of P. annua to that of S. faberi) of 2.4 for tepraloxydim, 56.3 for sethoxydim, and 73.3 for a tepraloxydim analog with a propyl chain at R2. These findings suggest that the binding site structure of cyclohexane-1,3-diones in ACCase differs between P. annua and S. faberi.",
