In a model aquatic ecosystem study, BCFs of <1 were measured in fish and snails for the sodium salt of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid(2,3). According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. MCPA is absorbed through leaves or roots and is readily translocated in plants(4)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Microbial degradation of MCPA in soil was followed by measuring radiolabeled 14-CO2 evolution(1); in non-acclimated soil, CO2 evolution reached 40-50% after 78 days of incubation(1). At an initial MCPA concn of 5 mg/kg, CO2 evolution increased markedly after a 2-3 week lag period indicating that microbial adaptation will increase the degradation rate(1); optimum degradation occurred in soil with a moisture content of 0.6 to 1.2 field capacity(1) while degradation in dry soil was negligible(1). The importance of acclimation was demonstrated in soil degradation tests in which degradation in unacclimated soil required 46-82 days, but only 5-14.5 days were required for a subsequent degradation in the same soil(2); sterilization tests (via sodium azide) indicated that all soil degradation was microbial in nature(2). The results of laboratory studies indicated that 14C-labeled MCPA would degrade faster in soils that had received previous applications than in untreated soils(3). Microbial degradation in soil is probably due to hydroxylation with cleavage of the ether linkage (4). The dechlorination of MCPA was indicated as an acid-yielding reaction and was observed to reduce the pH in a mixed culture medium; no degradation occurred in cultures above pH 8.5 and degradation was slower at higher concns(5). In samples of sandy clay soil (pH 5.2, organic matter 6.3%) at field capacity moisture content (18.2%) and incubated at 23 \u00b0C for up to 32 weeks, MCPA, at initial concns of 10, 100, 200 and 500 ppm, degraded more rapidly at the lower concns(6). Respective losses of 40%, 60% and 90% were observed at 2, 8 and 32 weeks; the degradates were identified as 4-chloro-o-cresol, 5-chloro-3-methylcatechol, and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol(6)."

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: MCPA was reported to be rapidly degraded (actual rates not reported) in a laboratory scale semi-continuous anaerobic sludge digester(1). However, using a primary digester sludge as inoculum and a serum bottle technique, MCPA was found to be resistent (lag period > 75 days) to anaerobic degradation(2). Using a soil inoculum, (14)CO2 evolution half-lives of 32-48 days were measured(3). Using non-adapted seawater and marine sediment as inoculum, 14-CO2 evolutions of 0.1-0.9% were measured over a 24 hr incubation period(4). In flooded sediment, the complete degradation of MCPA took 96 wks, but only 48 wks in moist soil; the ratio of relative persistence in moist soil vs. flooded sediment was determined to be 1:2.3 (5). In a model ecosystem which was built to model anaerobic (sulfate-reducing) conditions in an aquifer, MCPA was relatively persistent, with only a slight decrease in concn observed; the decrease was attributed mainly to adsorption (6). In a field study conducted in a limestone aquifer and in a laboratory microcosm study, MCPA did not degrade under anaerobic conditions (7)."

Duration of residual activity in soil is approximately 3-4 months (1). Soil moisture was found to be an important biodegradation factor as the degradation rate in air-dried soils was less than 30% after 579 days of incubation(2); no degradation occurred at temperatures ranging from -30 to 0 \u00b0C (2). Field studies indicate that MCPA dissipates from soil plots with half-lives ranging from 6 to 60 days (3). In one field study, the initial MCPA half-life was approximately 29 days when using a soil that had no previous MCPA applications(4); in soil that had received 1-18 years of previous exposures, the half-life was approximately 10 days(4). Duration of residual activity in soil is approximately 3 to 4 months, following an application rate of 3 kg/ha(1). MCPA has also been observed to degrade in subsoils (5)."

Ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate was administered orally to the animals at the doses of 200, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day for 2 wk. Clofibrate (500 mg/kg/day) was also tested for comparison, because of its similarity to ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate in chemical structure and pharmacological actions. Body wt gain was slightly decreased, but liver to body wt ratio was increased in the ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate groups of 500 and 1000 mg/kg and also in the clofibrate group. In these groups, the cholesterol level in the liver was decreased but that in bile was increased. The composition of biliary bile acids was also changed in both the ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate groups (500 and 1000 mg/kg) and the clofibrate group, but in a different manner; the levels and proportions of secondary bile acids were increased in the ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate groups, while those of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid were decreased in the clofibrate group. These results indicate that ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate and clofibrate may affect cholesterol catabolism differently, although these two cmpd contain the same chlorinated phenoxy acid moiety. The increased level of cholesterol in bile might lead to the formation of cholesterol gallstone, which is frequently found in patients with gallbladder cancer. It is inferred that exposure to ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate could be a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, which was initiated with some chemical carcinogens, because it increased the levels and proportions of both cholesterol and secondary bile acids in bile."

These cmpd were administered orally 200 mg/kg/day to the rats for 2 wk. Both ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate and clofibrate increased the hepatic level of cytochrome p450. In the ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate treated group, the activities of aniline hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumari O-deethylase increased by 15% and 1.5 fold, respectively. The free acid form of ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxycetate increased these activities more potently than ethyl 4- chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate. Both ethyl 4-chloro-2- methylphenoxyacetate and its free acid did not change the activity of aminopyrine N-demethylase. A marked increase in the activity of aniline hydroxylase was noted in the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid treated group, whereas the aminopyrine N-demethylase activity significantly decreased in the same group. Clofibrate also increased the activities of hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450 mediated oxidation tested, but to a lesser extent when compared with the effects of ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate. These results indicate that ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetate may have a potent effect on the hepatic metabolizing enzymes in rats, and also that the induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may change when the chemical moiety of phenoxyacid cmpd is modified."

The dose of 5.6 mg/egg was toxic. No difference in genetic activity between the commercial formulation and the pure cmpd was found. A cell cycle delaying effect of 2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid was evident at all the dose levels tested. The mitotic index remained unchanged."

The 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours median lethal concentrations (LC50) were 25.7, 21.7, 17.0 and 13.2 mg/L, respectively. Fish were also exposed to a sublethal thiobencarb concentration (1/60 LC50-96 hr = 0.22 mg/L) during 96 hours in a flow-through system and then an elimination period of 192 hours in clean water was allowed. Eels were removed and blood samples taken out at each exposure time and recovery period in order to evaluate AChE activity. Thiobencarb induced significant inhibitory effects on plasma AChE activity of A. anguilla from the first contact time with the toxicant. This inhibition (under 50% activity) was maintained during the entire exposure period (96 hours) and even those animals transferred to clean water showed plasma AChE activity different from the controls. Differences between total and specific AChE activity were detected during the exposure period. Total AChE activity in the plasma from animals transferred to a medium free of toxicant recovered its normal value while specific AChE activity remained depressed (< 50%) until five days later."

When MCPA was applied to a rice field, an observed 70% decrease in MCPA was attributed to losses through soil percolation(5). In a laboratory study of leaching columns with either turf grass soil or two subsoils, most of the applied MCPA (95.4-99.0%) eluted with the first 100-ml fraction of leaching water applied to the columns, indicating that MCPA did not bind to the soils(6).

Results are presented which show the effect on absorption and translocation of method of application, age of treatment leaf, treatment period, pretreatment with 5 \u03bcM ATP and removal of cuticle wax by chloroform wipe treatment. Significant negative correlations between cuticle wax fixation/translocation and leaf tissue content/translocation were recorded for both compounds, particularly MCPB, suggesting the involvement of both physico-chemical and metabolic components in the process of absorption and translocation. The nature of the mechanisms involved was further investigated using isolated cuticle/epidermal systems and tightly-coupled mitochondria isolated from roots of V. faba L. The results suggest that non-movement of MCPB in this species is largely due to its enhanced retention within the cuticle and to the fact that it is a more effective uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation than MCPA. The importance of these findings in terms of the relative efficiency of translocation of MCPA and MCPB when applied in vivo is discussed.",

Dose-response studies revealed that the resistance factor for MCPA, based on GR50 comparisons of total dry weight of resistant (R) and susceptible (S) plants, was 3.3. Resistance factors for fluroxypyr, dicamba, 2,4-D, glyphosate, and chlorsulfuron were 8.2, 1.7, 1.6, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively. MCPA resistance was not due to differences in absorption, because both R and S biotypes absorbed 54% of applied [^14C]MCPA 72 h after treatment. However, R plants exported less (45% vs. 58% S) recovered ^14C out of treated leaves to the apical meristem (6% vs. 13% S) and root (32% vs. 38% S). In both biotypes, approximately 20% of the ^14C recovered in planta was detected as MCPA metabolites. However, less of the ^14C recovered in the roots of R plants was MCPA. Therefore, two different mechanisms protect R hemp-nettle from MCPA phytotoxicity: a lower rate of MCPA translocation and a higher rate of MCPA metabolism in the roots. In support of these results, genetic studies indicated that the inheritance of MCPA resistance is governed by at least two nuclear genes with additive effects.",

Watson), which is a significant weed in U.S. cropping systems. Previously, resistance to 2,4-D and MCPA was documented in an A. palmeri population (KCTR) from Kansas. Recent research suggested that rapid metabolism of 2,4-D confers resistance in KCTR A. palmeri; however, the mechanism of MCPA resistance in this population remains unknown. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the level of MCPA resistance in KCTR compared with two known susceptible populations of A. palmeri, MSS and KSS; (2) study the absorption and translocation of [^14C]MCPA in KCTR and MSS plants; (3) investigate the metabolic profile of [^14C]MCPA in KCTR and MSS and compare them with MCPA-tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants; and (4) assess the possible role of cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) in MCPA metabolism. Experiments were conducted to assess the level of resistance in KCTR. Using [^14C]MCPA, the absorption, translocation, and metabolic profiles were assessed in A. palmeri. Involvement of P450s was confirmed using malathion, a known P450 inhibitor. Regression analyses indicate that the KCTR population exhibits a 3-fold resistance to MCPA. No difference in absorption of [^14C]MCPA was found between MSS and KCTR. However, the KCTR plants translocated less [^14C]MCPA at 48 hours after treatment (HAT) and metabolized MCPA more rapidly than MSS plants at 12 and 24 HAT. MCPA resistance in KCTR was reversed upon treatment with malathion, indicating the involvement of P450s in the metabolism of this herbicide.
