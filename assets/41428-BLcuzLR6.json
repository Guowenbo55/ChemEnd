Previous studies have established the selectivity and concentration exposure time requirements for aquatic herbicides used to control hydrilla and EWM; therefore, the objective of this research was to conduct a comparative study evaluating fluridone, triclopyr, and penoxsulam absorption and translocation in these two aquatic plants. Using 14C-labeled herbicides, absorption and translocation were measured over a 192-h time course. On the basis of differences in lipophilicity among the three herbicides (fluridone, penoxsulam, triclopyr), it was expected that fluridone would have the highest accumulation, with significantly lower accumulation for penoxsulam and triclopyr. However, experimental results did not support this hypothesis. Triclopyr accumulation was highest in EWM and was equivalent to fluridone in hydrilla. Penoxsulam absorption and translocation were low in both species. Additionally, accumulation after shoot exposure was approximately three times greater for EWM compared with hydrilla. Shoot-to-root translocation was limited, with a maximum of 12.5% of absorbed triclopyr reaching hydrilla roots 192 h after treatment.",

The fern spreads across the landscape by wind-blown spores and invades isolated and undisturbed habitats such as interior portions of the Florida Everglades. Land managers in Florida have reported that multiple herbicide treatments are required to control the fern, which could indicate that herbicides do not translocate throughout the plant in long-established populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the absorption and translocation patterns in Old World climbing fern using the three herbicides most commonly used for management of this plant by land managers in Florida. Using 14C-labeled herbicides, we evaluated absorption and translocation of glyphosate (2.25 kg ai ha\u22121), metsulfuron (0.10 kg ai ha\u22121), and triclopyr (1.68 kg ai ha\u22121) in Old World climbing fern using five different application scenarios (cut-and-spray, basal spray, 25% foliar spray, 50% foliar spray, and 100% foliar spray). Triclopyr was absorbed to the greatest extent (60.3%) of applied radioactive compounds compared to glyphosate (31.2%) and metsulfuron (19.8%). The majority of radioactivity remained in treated leaves for all herbicides with only small percentages of the absorbed radioactivity being detected in other plant parts. All three herbicides translocated acropetally and basipitally to some extent. Radioactivity, for the most part, translocated evenly throughout the plants but the greatest amount of radioactivity derived from triclopyr occurred in rhizomes when the cut-and-spray and basal applications were used. The radioactivity in rhizomes derived from glyphosate was greater in those treated using cut-and-spray. Based on autoradiographs, there was limited horizontal movement of any herbicide in the rhizomes of Old World climbing fern which could explain why resprouts are observed several weeks following treatment.",

Results showed that roots of horsenettle were the major sink for photosynthate accumulation during the 0.2- to 0.5-bloom growth stages, as seen through autoradiography. Dicamba, picloram, and triclopyr were translocated into the roots of horsenettle, with accumulation continuing for at least 16 days. The amount of carbon associated with each herbicide found in the roots ranged from 1.3% at 4 days to 3.8% at 16 days. After 16 days, slightly more carbon from plants treated with dicamba and triclopyr (3.8% and 3.6%, respectively) than picloram (3.0%) was translocated to the roots. These compounds were metabolized slowly in the foliage and roots, as determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and autoradiography. In translocation studies, picloram at 1.12 kg/ha killed both treated and untreated shoots and roots, while dicamba and triclopyr at the highest rates killed the treated shoots and partially destroyed the root system. Symptoms were observed on the untreated shoots, but full recovery occurred at 8 weeks. The study suggests that the relatively higher herbicidal effectiveness of picloram must be attributed to its greater inherent potency, despite only slight differences in translocation observed between the herbicides.",
