            "Value": "A BCF range of 34-412 was measured in fish for carbazole using carp (Cyprinus carpio) which were exposed over an 6-week period to 0.05 and 0.005 ppm carbazole(1). A BCF of 125 was measured in mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) in a model ecosystem(2). A static experimental method using guppies (Poecilia reticulata) determined a carbazole BCF of 500(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.15 days has been reported for carbazole(5). Log BCFs for carbazole in alga (Oedogonium cardiacum), snail (Physa sp.) and mosquito larvae (Culex pepiens) were measured to be 1.69, 2.13 and 2.05, respectively; however, carbazole was metabolized to N-methyl and N-acetyl derivatives(2). The log BCF for carbazole in Daphnia pulex was experimentally determined to be 2.06(6)."

In a test for ready biodegradability according to OECD test guideline 301 E (Modified OECD Screening Test) using a mixed inoculum of a domestic sewage plant effluent and an aqueous bacterial solution extracted from local soil, carbazole was degraded to 86% within 7 days and to 93% within 28 days which passed criteria for being readily biodegradable(2). Carbazole is reported to be biodegradable by adapted microorganisms in water and soil(3)."

After 14 days of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, indigenous microorganisms removed 66% of carbazole (initial concentration of 2.9 ug/mL) from contaminated groundwater taken from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL(2). Levels of indigenous carbazole mineralization varied from 0 to 46% after 60 days in mineralization experiments using C14 labeled carbazole in 3 southern Illinois soils(3). In the same experiment, the carbazole-degrading bacterium, Xanthamonas sp., was reintroduced and enhanced mineralization to 45% after 7 days in a soil where little indigenous mineralization occurred(3). Carbazole initial concentrations of 500 and 5 ppm did not degrade after 90 and 15 days, respectively, in Chernozen loamy soil at 19 \u00b0C based on thin layer chromatography(4). Using soils collected from an abandoned coal tar refinery in Ohio, carbazole was mineralized over a 64-day incubation period in serum bottle respirometry studies(5)."

Static serum bottle tests using an anaerobic sludge inoculum taken from digester tanks at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Beijing found that carbazole was poorly degraded over a 50-day incubation period(2)."

Carbazole was detected at concentrations ranging from 3.1 to 80 ug/g in 4 of 7 sediment samples taken from the Nervion River, Spain at an uncontrolled hazardous waste dump(2). Carbazole was qualitatively detected in Black River (Lorain, OH) sediment near the outfall of a coking plant associated with a steel production facility(3).

Sediments collected from the Newark Bay Estuary, New Jersey between 1991-1993 had median carbazole levels (dry wt) of 0.70 mg/kg (Arthur Kill site), 0.65 mg/kg (Hackensack River), 0.40 mg/kg (Kill Van Kull), 0.55 mg/kg (Newark Bay) and 0.70 mg/kg (Passaic River)(5). Carbazole was detected in 100% of 18 sediment samples from the Great Lakes basin at a median concentration of 50 ng/g dry wt (range of 20-130 ng/g)(6). Streambed sediment samples collected from 494 sites in 20 major river basins across the US during 1992-1995 had positive carbazole detections in 12.6% of all samples; concentrations of <50, 81, 180 and 1400 ug/kg dry wt at the 75th, 90th, 95th and maximum value, respectively, were reported(6)."

            "Value": "Based on an experimental Koc range of 114 to 1180, the average Koc value in 21 soil horizons comprised of nine different soils was determined to be 637(1). The variation of Koc value in different soils was thought to result from variation of organic matter sorbent in structure and content(1). Experimentally determined Koc values 2500(2) and 4980(3) have also been reported. In CA-Montmorillonite soil (0.06% organic content) and Coyote Creek sediment (1.4% organic content), Koc values of 5300 and 12500 were measured for carbazole(4). According to a classification scheme(5), the Koc range suggests that carbazole mobility can range from high mobility to being immobile in soil, with most values suggesting low mobility to immobility(SRC)."
