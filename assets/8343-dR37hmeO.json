Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was biodegraded 30% in 189 days from a starting concentration of 127.32 mg/kg outdoors with controlled watering(3). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was biodegraded over a 63 day period 34-50% in Neuherburg soil (24% clay, 2.6% organic carbon, pH 7.2), 28-41% in Ebersberger Forest soil (15% clay, 5.4% organic carbon, pH 3.4), and 24-36% in Baierbrunn soil (24% clay, 5.4% organic carbon, pH 4.5)(4). Observed biological half-lives for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate under aerobic conditions in soil was 31 to 98 days(5). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was biodegraded 75% in 42 days in sandy soil and sandy soil mixed with gravel/till taken from a plasticizer manufacturing site(6).

In general, biodegradation of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate occurs in soil, but at a slower rate than in water, since adsorption onto the soil organic matter reduces the availability of this compound for degradation(9). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 69% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(10)."

The role of PPAR-gamma (PPAR-gamma), class B scavenger receptor type 1 (SR-B1), and ERK1/2 was further studied to examine the signaling pathway for DEHP-induced apoptosis. Results showed that the levels of pRB, cyclin D, CDK2, cyclin E, and CDK4 were significantly lower in rats given 500 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP, while levels of p21 were significantly higher in rat testes. Dose-dependent increases in PPAR-gamma and RXRalpha proteins were observed in testes after DEHP exposure, while there was a significant decrease in RXRgamma protein levels. In addition to PPAR-gamma, DEHP also significantly increased SR-B1 mRNA and phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels. Furthermore, DEHP treatment induced pro-caspase-3 and cleavage of its substrate protein, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), in a dose-dependent manner. Data suggest that DEHP exposure may induce the expresson of apoptosis-related genes in testes through induction of PPAR-gamma and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway."

The species differences /responding to peroxisome proliferators, eg DEHP/, particularly with respect to humans compared to rats and mice, can be potentially attributed to ... the level of expression and functional capability of PPAR-alpha, the presence or absence of active PPREs in the promoter region of specific genes, and other aspects of interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. ... Marked species differences in the expression of PPAR-alpha mRNA have been demonstrated between rodent and human liver, with the latter expressing 1-10% of the levels found in mouse or rat liver ... PPAR-alpha protein expression /in human livers/ contained less than 10% of the level in mice. ... In most human samples studied, it was found that PPREs are mainly bound by other competing proteins that may block peroxisome proliferator responsiveness. In addition, the low levels of PPAR-alpha protein detected in human liver were lower than those estimated from RNA analysis and this was explained by the finding that a significant fraction of PPAR-alpha mRNA is mis-spliced in human liver. ... The truncated PPAR-alpha mRNA accounted for 25-50% of total PPAR-alpha mRNA in 10 human liver samples, while no truncated PPAR-alpha mRNA was found in livers of rats and mice. The truncated human PPAR-alpha mRNA was expressed in vitro, where it was shown to (a) fail to bind to PPRE, a necessary step for gene activation and (b) interfere with gene activation by expressed full-length human PPAR-alpha, in part due to titration of coactivator CREB-binding protein, an additional element of transcriptional regulation. ... Differential species sensitivity to peroxisome proliferators could depend on gene-specific factors. In the case of peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, the promoter regions containing PPRE responsible for transcriptional activation of the rodent gene are not present in the promoter region of the human gene ... The absence of a significant response of human liver to induction of peroxisome proliferation and hepatocellular proliferation is explained by several aspects of PPAR-alpha-mediated regulation of gene expression. ...

Testes were analyzed for histopathology, TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analyses. Animals exposed to DEHP for 2 days or 7 days showed severe alterations of seminiferous tubules characterized by germ cell sloughing. Animals from the longer term recovery group treated with DEHP showed foci of delayed spermatogenesis. A linear and continuous pattern of N-cadherin was observed in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules. A similar pattern but with higher IF intensity was observed for N-cadherin in rats treated with DEHP for 2 days or 7 days, compared to control animals. The alpha-, beta- and p120-catenins were detected in the basal compartment of seminiferous tubules in similar localization and IF pattern for DEHP and control groups. A significant increase in testicular N-cadherin and alpha-catenin levels was detected by Western blot analysis in DEHP-exposed versus control rats. No variations in N-cadherin or catenin expression were detected in the recovery groups. These findings demonstrate that DEHP induces an up-regulation of N-cadherin and alpha-catenin expression and may perturb cell-cell adhesion phenomena in the seminiferous tubule."

Cessation of dosing at week 78 produced a reversal of hepatic effects including neoplasms; however, treatment-related changes in tissues other than the liver did not disappear after removal of DEHP from the diet."

In a second experiment, Sertoli cell proliferation was measured and a morphological examination of testis was conducted at 6, 9, 12, 24, or 48 hours after rats were dosed with 0 or 200 mg/kg bw DEHP. ... In rats treated with 100-500 mg/kg bw DEHP, there was a dose-related increase in abnormally large gonocytes containing 2-4 nuclei. Multinucleated gonocytes were first detected at 12 hours following exposure to 200 mg/kg bw DEHP, and their numbers increased with time. Sertoli cell proliferation was reduced in rats treated with > or = 100 mg/kg bw DEHP, as noted by significant decreases in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling. BrdU labeling indices were reported at 27.03% in control rats, 20.83% in the 100 mg/kg bw group, 9.95% in the 200 mg/kg bw group, and 4.13% in the 500 mg/kg bw group. There was a rebound in Sertoli cell proliferation at 48 hours following treatment with 200 mg/kg bw DEHP; at that time point, the labeling index was 30.5% in the DEHP group and 24.7% in controls. Dosing with up to 500 mg/kg bw DEHP did not affect serum FSH levels. To determine the role of DEHP metabolites, measurement of Sertoli cell proliferation and a morphological examination of testis were conducted in 4 rats/group that were gavage dosed with vehicle, 393 mg/kg bw MEHP (> 95% purity) in corn oil, or 167 mg/kg bw 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH, > 95% purity) in phosphate-buffered saline. The doses of MEHP and 2-ethylhexanol were equivalent to 500 mg/kg bw DEHP on a molar basis (1.28 mmol/kg bw). Like DEHP, MEHP caused an increase in large multinucleated gonocytes and a decrease in BrdU labeling. Those effects were not observed following treatment with 2-ethylhexanol. To determine if inhibited Sertoli cell proliferation is due to altered expression of cell cycle regulators, expression of D1, D2, D3, and p27kipl proteins and cyclin D2 mRNA was measured in 4-5 rats/group gavage dosed with 0, 200, or 500 mg/kg DEHP; rats were killed at 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours following dosing. Statistically significant effects included a small but reproducible decrease in cyclin D2 protein level at 8 and 12 hours following treatment with 200 mg/kg bw DEHP. ... The decrease in D2 protein expression was confirmed by a dose-related reduction in D2 mRNA expression in the 200 and 500 mg/kg bw groups. ... /It was concluded/ that DEHP-induced transient reductions in Sertoli cell proliferation and changes in gonocyte morphology are mediated through MEHP, alterations in Sertoli cell proliferation do not occur as a result of changes in FSH levels, and developing testes are especially vulnerable to phthalate-induced toxicity."

There was no apparent effect on reproductive function in the animals exposed to di-n-octyl phthalate at dose levels sufficient to cause a significant increase in liver weight. Both di-n-propyl phthalate and di-n-pentyl phthalate were toxic to the reproductive system as evidenced by a complete inhibition of fertility at 1.25 and 2.5% di-n-pentyl phthalate or 5.0% di-n-propyl phthalate, and reduced fertility (litters/pair and live pups/litter, 0.5% di-n-pentyl phthalate; live pups/liter, 2.5% di-n-propyl phthalate).

The data revealed DEHP exposure significantly reduced the percentage of methylated CpG sites in Igf2r and Peg3 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in primordial germ cells from female and male fetal mouse, particularly, in the oocytes of 21 dpp mice (F1), which were produced by the pregnant micetreated with DEHP. More surprisingly, the modification of the DNA methylation of imprinted genes in F1 mouse oocytes was heritable to F2 offspring which exhibit lower percentages of methylated CpG sites in imprinted genes DMRs. In conclusion, DEHP exposure can affect the DNA methylation of imprinting genes not only in fetal mouse germ cells and growing oocytes, but also in offspring's oocytes."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is an estrogen-like compound widely used as a commercial plasticizer and present in medical devices, tubing, food containers and packaging. It is considered an endocrine disruptor and studies on experimental animals showed that exposure to DEHP can alter the function of several organs including liver, kidneys, lungs and reproductive system, particularly the developing testes of prenatal and neonatal males. Exposure to DEHP has been proposed as a potential human health hazard. This study assessed the effects of DEHP on folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation using the mouse as the experimental model. Newborn female mice were hypodermically injected with DEHP at doses of 20 and 40 ug/kg per body weight following different exposure regimens during the weaning period. We found that DEHP altered both folliculogenesis and oocyte development. In particular, DEHP exposure significantly decreased the number of the primordial follicles at pubertal and adult age by possibly accelerating the rate of follicle recruitment dynamics, reduced and/or delayed the level of imprinted gene methylation in the oocytes and increased metaphase II spindle abnormalities in oocytes matured in vitro. Furthermore, the weight of pups and litter size of mothers exposed to DEHP were significantly lower than controls. Finally, the number of primordial follicles appeared significantly reduced also in the F1 offspring at the adult age. These results show that DEHP may have a number of adverse effects on oogenesis, especially when exposure occurs during early postnatal age, arising concerns about the exposure of human female infants and children to this compound."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Peroxisome proliferation and carcinogenesis is mediated through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), and activation of this receptor has been shown to be necessary for DEHP-induced liver toxicity and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. Although human liver also contains PPAR alpha, the receptor population is lower for humans than for rodents. In addition, the human response element that binds to the activated receptor to initiate the cellular responses may be inactive, suggesting that the lack or responsiveness in humans is related to the response element rather than to the receptor population."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles present in all cell types and contain a number of hydrogen peroxide generating oxidases, catalase (which catalyses the degradation of hydrogen peroxide), and a fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme system. Peroxisome proliferation is characterised by increased peroxisome volume density (resulting from an increase primarily in the number of peroxisomes, although size may also be increased), changes in morphology, and induction of peroxisomal enzyme activities. ... /Other/ effects of PPs in hepatocytes of rats and mice include mitochondrial proliferation (with changes in enzyme activities), increase in the number of lysosomal bodies (with changes in enzyme activities and lipofuscin deposition), and induction of some microsomal enzyme activities. While marked effects have been observed in hepatocytes, only minor effects have been observed in certain other tissues. The term PPs covers substances, which in rodents induce peroxisome proliferation and liver enlargement (hepatomegaly), the latter being due to both hepatocyte hyperplasia (increased replicative DNA synthesis and cell division) and hypertrophy. Hepatomegaly and peroxisome proliferation is an early event during exposure to DEHP and has been observed in rats from about 14 days of exposure and throughout the exposure period at dose levels from 0.05% DEHP in the diet."

Oral exposure to di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) once daily for 4 days elevated the serum levels of ACTH and corticosterone in rats 20 and 40 days of age, but not in adult, 60-day-old animals. Furthermore, primary cultures of adrenocortical cells isolated from 20- and 40-day-old rats treated with DEHP exhibited an enhanced capacity to produce corticosterone in response to ACTH, dibutyryl cAMP, and 22R-hydroxycholesterol, as well as increased ACTH-stimulated transport of endogenous cholesterol into mitochondria. Neither DEHP nor its major metabolite mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate altered steroidogenesis in cultures of adrenocortical cells isolated from untreated rats."

The dissipation rates of PAEs in the sediment exhibited a positive correlation with exposure time, with over 68.12% reduction observed after 28 days, even under high initial concentrations. All five PAEs were taken up by the roots from contaminated sediment, translocated into stems and leaves, and their content in each tissue showed significant linear correlations with the sediment content. DEHP demonstrated the highest transportation from sediment to roots and stems, followed by BBP, DBP, DIBP, and DAP, while the order of transportation from roots to leaves was reversed. Throughout the 28-day exposure, the average concentration of each PAE in stems was the highest, followed by roots, leaves, and edible parts. DEHP and BBP were identified as major contaminants in edible parts but were deemed safe for human health. The accumulation of PAEs in edible parts was influenced by various factors, including PAE species and concentration, survival time, and harvest time of edible parts. The study highlighted the potential of Zizania latifolia not only as a safe food source but also as a promising plant for remediating contaminated sediment by accumulating and degrading PAEs from the environment.",
