Following inhalation exposures at 1 ppm, all species lost weight. Rats were appreciably less active, and the rabbits developed ataxia. At 0.2 ppm, monkeys were apathetic, suffered from anorexia, and appeared anesthetized. There was progressive incoordination, hind limb immobility and muscle tremors in both nonhuman primates and dogs inhaling pentaborane."
