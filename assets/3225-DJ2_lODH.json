In this work we show that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor okadaic acid increases histamine synthesis up to twofold in rat cortical miniprisms containing histaminergic nerve endings. This effect was mimicked by the PP2A/PP1 inhibitor calyculin, but not by the inactive analog 1-norokadaone. Other phosphatase inhibitors like endothall (PP2A), cypermethrin and cyclosporin A (protein phosphatase 2B, PP2B) had much lower effects. The effects of okadaic acid appeared to be mediated by an activation of the histamine synthesizing enzyme, histidine decarboxylase. PKA-mediated activation of histamine synthesis decreased the EC(50) and maximal effects of okadaic acid. On the other hand, CaMKII-mediated activation of histamine synthesis decreased okadaic acid maximal effects, but it increased its EC(50). In conclusion, our results indicate that brain histamine synthesis is subjected to regulation by phosphatases PP2A and PP1, and perhaps also PP2B as well as by protein kinases."

            "Value": "... Protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors and rat cerebellar glial cells in primary culture /were used/ to investigate the role of PP activity in the ability of glial cells to detoxify exogenously applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The marine toxin okadaic acid (OKA), a potent PP1 and PP2A inhibitor, caused a concentration-dependent degeneration of astrocytes and increased the formation of hydroperoxide radicals significantly. Subtoxic exposures to OKA significantly potentiated toxicity by exogenous H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 that reduced by 50% the survival of astrocytes after 3 hr was estimated at 720+/-40 uM in the absence and 85+/-30 uM in the presence of the toxin. The PP inhibitors calyculin A and endothall also potentiated H2O2 toxicity in cerebellar astrocytes. OKA caused a time-dependent inhibition of both glial catalase and glutathione peroxidase, reducing by approximately 50% the activity of these enzymes after 3 hr, whereas other enzymatic activities remained unaffected. Also, OKA reduced the cellular content of total glutathione and elevated oxidized glutathione to about 25% of total glutathione. OKA-treated astrocytes cleared H2O2 from the incubation medium approximately two times more slowly than control cultures. Our results suggest a prominent role for PP activity in the antioxidant mechanisms protecting astrocytes against damage by H2O2."

Positive controls were administered ip doses of carbon tetrachloride at 1.5 mg/kg for elevated microsomal lipid peroxidation, SGPT activities, and hepatic triglyceride levels; diethyl maleate at 0.3 mg/kg for lowered glutathione levels; and 2,4-dinitrophenol at 40 mg/kg for reductions in hepatic ATP levels and increases in oligomycin sensitive mitochondrial magnesium (Mg2+) dependent adenosine triphosphatase activities. Necropsy revealed enlarged and congested livers. Liver weights increased to 136% and hemoglobin levels to 200% after treatment, although no changes in hepatic glutathione content, microsomal lipid peroxidation, hepatic triglycerides, or serum SGPT levels were noted. Carbon tetrachloride increased serum SGPT levels by 140 fold, hepatic triglycerides more than 10 fold, and microsomal lipid peroxidation by 43%. Diethyl maleate reduced glutathione by 39%. Endothall increased hepatic glycogen metabolism and reduced hepatic ATP levels significantly. Endothall did not affect mitochondrial Mg2+ dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity, although the microsomal enzyme was inhibited. It was concluded that endothall acts directly on the mouse liver."

Cantharidin (CA), endothall, and endothall thioanhydride (ETA) inhibited the activity of protein phosphatases-1 (PP1) and protein phosphatases-2A (PP2A), and the potency sequence was CA > endothall > ETA in vitro. ... The potency sequence of ETA > CA > endothall was established for the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A in vivo. ETA predominantly targets PP1 for inhibition in liver, as revealed by assays specific for PP1 or PP2A. Studies using 3T3 fibroblasts showed that only ETA, but not CA or endothall, induced marked morphological changes. These effects included cell rounding and detachment as well as extensive reorganization of actin filaments and are characteristic for the cell-permeable phosphatase-inhibitory toxins."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ It is becoming increasingly clear that protein phosphatases are important modulators of cellular function and that disruption of these proteins are involved in neurodegenerative disease processes. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) such as protein phosphatase PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin are involved in hyperphosphorylation of tau- as well as beta-amyloid-induced cell death. ... Serine/threonine protein phosphatases /were shown/ to be involved in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin in the mechanism of estrogen mediated neuroprotection against oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Treatment with protein phosphatases inhibitor II, endothall, or cyclosporin A, which are specific inhibitors of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin, respectively, did not have an effect on cell viability. However, in combination, these inhibitors adversely affected cell survival, which suggests the importance of serine/threonine protein phosphatases in maintenance of cellular function. Inhibitors of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin attenuated the protective effects of estrogen against glutamate-induced -neurotoxicity but did not completely abrogate the estrogen-mediated protection. The attenuation of estrogen-induced neuroprotection was achieved through decrease in the activity of theses serine/threonine phosphatases without the concomitant decrease in protein expression. In an animal model, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion caused a 50% decrease in levels of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B ipsilateral to the lesion in a manner that was prevented by estradiol pretreatment. ..."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The apicomplexan parasites pathogens such as Plasmodium spp. possess an apicoplast, a plastid organelle similar to those of plants. The apicoplast has some essential plant-like metabolic pathways and processes, making these parasites susceptible to inhibitors of these functions. The main objective of this paper is to determine if phytotoxins with plastid target sites are more likely to be good antiplasmodial compounds than are those with other modes of action. The antiplasmodial activities of some compounds with established phytotoxic action were determined in vitro on a chloroquine (CQ) sensitive (D6, Sierra Leone) strain of Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we provide in vitro activities of almost 50 such compounds, as well as a few phytoalexins against P. falciparum. Endothall, anisomycin, and cerulenin had sufficient antiplasmodial action to be considered as new lead antimalarial structures. Some derivatives of fusicoccin possessed markedly improved antiplasmodial action than the parent compound. Our results suggest that phytotoxins with plastid targets may not necessarily be better antiplasmodials than those that act at other molecular sites. The herbicides, phytotoxins and the phytoalexins reported here with significant antiplasmodial activity may be useful probes for identification of new antimalarial drug targets and may also be used as new lead structures for new antiplasmodial drug discovery."

            "Value": "The Koc of endothall is estimated as 13(1), using a log Kow of 1.91(2) and a regression-derived equation(1). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that endothall is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa values for the two carboxylic acid moieties of endothall are 3.4 and 6.7(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). The Koc of endothall in sediment/water systems has been measured to be < 2(2) and 10(6)."

            "Value": "Endothal (7-oxabicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid) has been recognized for its herbicidal and defoliant properties on both terrestrial plants and aquatic weeds. While the literature provides insights into its physiological effects on plants, including its uptake and translocation, a notable aspect of endothal's behavior is its systemic action within plant tissues. Initial studies demonstrated that endothal is not extensively translocated from treated leaves, but research has shown that it can move into shoots following root application. Notably, recent investigations have highlighted the potential movement of endothal through plant tissues, particularly within the phloem parenchyma and sieve tubes. It has been suggested that injury to phloem parenchyma could limit its translocation, and thus, the systemic action of endothal might be influenced by factors like dosage and the degree of tissue injury. Additionally, the observed metabolization of endothal within plant tissues implies that the translocated radioactivity might not be solely associated with the original endothal molecule. As such, endothal's systemic behavior offers an interesting avenue for further research to comprehensively understand its mode of action and movement within plants. "
