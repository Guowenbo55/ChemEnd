However, like 2,4-D butyl ester, 2,4-D isopropyl ester may also be readily metabolized in fish and therefore should not bioconcentrate(4)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded in a laboratory test by activated sewage acclimated to 2,4-D(1). 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded at half the rate of the parent acid which is rapidly degraded(1). In another study, in which 2,4-D isopropyl ester was incubated with domestic sewage microorganisms, 2,4-D isopropyl ester was hydrolyzed and the acid was later decomposed biologically(2). The lag period being 7 days after which the isopropyl alcohol was 98.5% oxidized in 2 days(2). These results are consistent with microbial hydrolysis after a 7 day acclimation period(2)."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,4-D isopropyl ester is expected to have low mobility in soil(SRC). 2,4-D isopropyl ester is adsorbed slightly by clay minerals with the adsorption to bentonite > illite > kaolinite(4). Large amounts of bentonite, illite and kaolinite, namely 6.89, 11.79 and 37.59 grams respectively, would be required to reduce the concentration of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water from 3 mg/l to 2 mg/l(4)."
