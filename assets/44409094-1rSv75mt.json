            "content": "Dufulin, a biologically derived antiviral agent, has shown effectiveness against viral diseases in plants like tobacco, rice, cucumber, and tomato. However, its environmental behaviors and fate under different cultivation systems are not well understood. This study investigated the absorption, translocation, and accumulation of 14C-labeled Dufulin stereoisomers in cherry radish tissues. The experiments revealed that Dufulin was more readily absorbed through leaf daubing than through soil mixing, with over 93% of the pesticide remaining in the labeled leaves. Both enantiomers of Dufulin were taken up by radish roots and translocated to the upper part of the plant, but less than 0.2% of Dufulin was absorbed from the soil, suggesting easier entry through the leaf surface. Interestingly, the study found non-stereoselective absorption and translocation of Dufulin stereoisomers, indicating that rac-Dufulin and its metabolites should be a major focus for further research. These results contribute to a better understanding of Dufulin's environmental risk assessment, aiding in its responsible use to ensure eco-environmental safety and human health.",
