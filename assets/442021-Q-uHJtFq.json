            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc for brucine can be estimated to be 81(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that brucine is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of brucine is 8.28(3) indicating that this compound will exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the cation is not expected to volatilize. Therefore, the ability of brucine to adsorb to sediments an soil cannot be predicted with certainty since this compound may act markedly different than its estimated Koc value indicates(SRC)."
