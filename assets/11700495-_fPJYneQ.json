            "content": "Florasulam is a triazolopyrimidine sulfonanilide herbicide used post-emergence in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Its selectivity in wheat is primarily due to differences in metabolism rates, with wheat metabolizing it much faster (half-life of 2.4 hours) compared to broadleaf weeds (half-lives ranging from 19 to >48 hours). Additionally, selectivity, especially against broadleaf weed cleavers (Galium aparine L.), involves uptake differences. Metabolism data were generated using greenhouse-grown plants injected with radiolabelled florasulam, followed by extraction and processing using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Wheat plants metabolize florasulam by hydroxylation of the aniline ring para to the nitrogen, followed by conjugation to glucose. While the slow metabolism of broadleaf weeds prevented the isolation of metabolites, HPLC data suggest that hydroxylation is the major pathway for their metabolism.",
