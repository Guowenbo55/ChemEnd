            "Value": "Musk ketone was detected in trout collected from different fish farms in the western part of Denmark between Sept 1999 to Jan 2000 and again between Sept 2003 to Jan 2004 at concentrations ranging from <0.13 to 5.16 ug/kg fresh weight, median 0.65 ug/kg fresh weight and <0.28 and 1.0 ug/kg fresh weight, median <0.28 ug/kg fresh weight, respectively(1). Musk ketone was detected in a variety of fish collected from German fish-markets (1990-1992), German fish-farms (Spring 1990 and Winter 1992/1993), and German rivers (Summers 1991-1993) as well as mussels and shrimp from the German North Sea Coast (1991-1994) at concentrations ranging from <0.01 to 0.38 mg/kg fat, 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg fat, and 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg fat for fish, mussels, and shrimp respectively(2). Musk ketone was detected in 16 of 25 Atlantic cod, haddock, thornback ray, and saithe livers and fillets from harbors in Norway in Winter 1997/98 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/g lipids to 42 ng/g, average 11.4 ng/g lipids(3). Musk ketone has been reported in European aquatic biota: eel 10-450 ng/g, pike-perch 10-70 ng/g, rainbow trout 30-120 ng/g, brown trout 1000-1150 ng/g, blue mussel 10-30 ng/g, shrimp 20-430 ng/g, crusican carp 920-1560 ng/g, and mussels 1280 ng/g(4). Musk ketone has been reported in Canadian aquatic biota: lobster 110-190 ng/g, clams 17000 ng/g, mussels 2200 ng/g, lake trout 76-730 ng/g(4). Musk ketone was detected in 5 Hammerhead Shark, 8 Finless Porpoise and 3 Porpoise fetus samples, collected from the Ariake Sea and Yatsushire Sea, Japan, at concentrations of less than 2.3 ng/g(5). Musk ketone was detected in wild brown trout muscle tissue, at concentrations of 383.6 ug/kg, sampled downstream from a sewage treatment plant in Prachatice, Czech Republic during June 2009; musk ketone was not detected above the limit of quantification upstream of this site(6). Musk ketone was not detected in bullhead, shad, and perch fish sampled from Hamilton Harbor of Lake Ontario, the Detroit River, and western Lake Erie, in Spring 2002(7)."
