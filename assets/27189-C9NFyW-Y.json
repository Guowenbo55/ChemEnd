Shoot growth was reduced less than root growth in both species. Corn roots were approximately 10 times more sensitive to napropamide than were tomato roots. Translocation of napropamide from the roots to the shoot of tomato occurred within 0.5 h and followed an apoplastic pattern. Little movement of napropamide from the roots to the shoots occurred in corn. Metabolism of napropamide was not evident in either species during an 8-h exposure. Absorption studies showed that total napropamide levels were 60% higher in corn root tissue than in tomato root tissue. The greater napropamide content in the corn roots was associated with a tightly bound fraction of the total napropamide influx.",
