    "Description": "Mecarbam is an organic thiophosphate that is O,O-diethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate in which the hydrogen attached to a sulfur is replaced by a 2-[(ethoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl group. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide and an agrochemical. It is an organic thiophosphate, an organothiophosphate insecticide and a carbamate ester.",

The rate of degradation slowed considerably during August-September and was very low for October-November(1). Mecarbam residues remaining after 10 months averaged 4%(1). Degradation of this compound may have been due to both biodegradation and hydrolysis(SRC). Mecarbam added to a composite soil had a Ks value of 0.0495, where the Ks value is a constant which measures the rate of dissipation of mecarbam(2)."

Specifically, emulsifiable concentrates of these insecticides were applied to the soil surface of rice plants, and the penetration, translocation, and accompanying insecticidal activity were examined. The results showed that disulfoton exhibited high concentrations in the underground parts of the rice plant shortly after application, indicating rapid penetration into the underground parts. Dimethoate showed almost equal concentrations in both the above-ground and underground parts, suggesting that it can easily penetrate and translocate within the plant body. In contrast, the penetration and translocation of vamidothion were gradual, while those of thiometon and mecarbam were weak. The increase in mortality of the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) in an insecticide bioassay conducted using the same application method corresponded roughly to the increase in insecticide concentrations in the above-ground parts. At the end of the experiment (6 days after application), residues of vamidothion were low.",
