Dicrotophos has been classified as a non-persistent pesticide with an estimated soil half-life of <0.5 month(2). (14)C-Dicrotophos was found to degrade rapidly in moist sandy loam soil (50% field capacity)  with 18.5% being recovered after 7-8 days(3). Ripperdan sandy loam soil was treated with 10 ppm (14)C-methoxy-labeled dicrotophos; 5.5% (14)C-dicrotophos was recovered after 7-8 days compared to 59.7% recovered from autoclaved soil(3). Addition of a bactericide, two fungicides, and an enzyme inhibitor at concentrations of 500 ppm were found to increase percent recovery to 54.6, 54.0, 49.7, and 75.2%, respectively(3). Dicrotophos applied as granules to field soils had an initial half-life of a few days(3)."

Monocrotophos and dicrotophos were translocated in greater amounts to young leaves than to bracts, fruiting branches or bottom leaves. Carbofuran was translocated to both young and old leaves. Where stems were treated, translocation was greater from young than from older stems and was enhanced where stems were abraded just prior to treatment. Soaking seeds in insecticide solutions for 1 h before sowing gave optimum translocation, particularly where the seeds had not been acid-delinted. Insecticides applied to leaves were translocated more rapidly upwards than downwards. Translocation from one edge of a leaf to the other did not occur."
