            "Value": "Occupational exposure to metals such as cobalt and beryllium represents a risk factor for respiratory health and can cause immune-mediated diseases. However, the way they act may be different. /Investigators/ show here that the two metals have a divergent effect on peripheral T lymphocytes and monocytes: BeSO(4) induces cell death in monocytes but not in T lymphocytes, which instead respond by producing Interferon gamma (IFN-?); conversely, CoCl(2) induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes but not in monocytes. Interestingly, both metals induce p53 overexpression but with a dramatic different outcome. This is because the effect of p53 in CoCl(2)-treated monocytes is counteracted by the antiapoptotic activity of cytoplasmic p21(Cip1/WAF1), the activation of nuclear factor ?B, and the inflammasome danger signaling pathway leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, CoCl(2)-treated monocytes do not fully differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cells, as inferred by the lack of expression of CD16 and CD83, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of HLA-class II molecules, as well as the capability of capturing and presenting the antigens, decreased with time. In conclusion, cobalt keeps monocytes in a partially activated, proinflammatory state that can contribute to some of the pathologies associated with the exposure to this metal."

Evidence suggests that CD4(+) T cells play a critical role in the development of this disease. Using intracellular cytokine staining, we found that the frequency of beryllium-specific CD4(+) T cells in the lungs (bronchoalveolar lavage) of 12 CBD patients ranged from 1.4% to 29% (mean 17.8%), and these T cells expressed a Th1-type phenotype in response to beryllium sulfate (BeSO(4)). Few, if any, beryllium-specific CD8(+) T cells were identified. In contrast, the frequency of beryllium-responsive CD4(+) T cells in the blood of these subjects ranged from undetectable to 1 in 500. No correlation was observed between the frequency of beryllium-responsive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) CD4(+) T cells as detected by intracellular staining and lymphocyte proliferation in culture after BeSO(4) exposure. Staining for surface marker expression showed that nearly all BAL T cells exhibit an effector memory cell phenotype. These results demonstrate a dramatically high frequency and compartmentalization of antigen-specific effector memory CD4(+) cells in the lungs of CBD patients."

BALB/c-3T3 cells were treated with varying concentrations of BeSO4 for 72 hr and the transformation frequency was determined after 4 weeks of culturing. Concentrations from 50-200 ug BeSO4/mL, caused a concentration-dependent increase (9-41 fold) in transformation frequency. Non-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells and cells from transformed foci induced by BeSO4 were injected into both axillary regions of nude mice. All ten Be-induced transformed cell lines injected into nude mice produced fibrosarcomas within 50 days after cell injection. No tumors were found in nude mice receiving non-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells 90 days post-injection. Gene amplification was investigated in K-ras, c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, c-sis, erb-B2 and p53 using differential PCR while random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting was employed to detect genomic instability. Gene amplification was found in K-ras and c-jun, however no change in gene expression or protein level was observed in any of the genes by Western blotting. Five of the 10 transformed cell lines showed genetic instability using different random primers. In conclusion, these results indicate that BeSO4 is capable of inducing morphological cell transformation in mammalian cells and that transformed cells induced by BeSO4 are potentially tumorigenic. Also, cell transformation induced by BeSO4 may be attributed, in part, to the gene amplification of K-ras and c-jun and some BeSO4-induced transformed cells possess neoplastic potential resulting from genomic instability."

Male Wistar rats were injected intravenously with radiolabeled beryllium sulfate, beryllium phosphate, or cadmium chloride. One hour after dosing, the animals were killed, the livers were removed, fractionated into parenchymal and non parenchymal fractions, and assayed for uptake of radioactivity. Ricin, modeccin, ricin plus D-mannose, or ricin plus D-galactose were incubated with hepatic parenchymal or non parenchymal cells. The uptake of ricin and modeccin was determined. In-vivo, beryllium sulfate and cadmium chloride were removed primarily by parenchymal cells. Beryllium phosphate was removed primarily by non parenchymal cells. In-vitro, parenchymal cells preferentially accumulated beryllium sulfate. Beryllium phosphate preferentially accumulated in non parenchymal cells. Complexation of cadmium with cysteine and penicillamine reduced cadmium uptake in both cell types. Complexation with 2,3-dimercaptopropanol and dithiothreitol (which formed colloidal complexes) enhanced cadmium uptake in both cell fractions. Ricin alone was taken up primarily by non parenchymal cells. D-mannose inhibited uptake and D-galactose enhanced uptake. Modeccin was taken up by both cell types essentially in equal amounts. The authors conclude that hepatotoxic substances from colloidal or particulate species are taken up primarily by non parenchymal cells which suffer the major toxic insult. Soluble toxins more readily enter parenchymal cells."

Preincubation of splenocytes with low concn of beryllium sulfate (<1 uM) or a broad range of zirconium disulfate concn (2-100 uM) was also found to assist subsequent lectin- (concanavalin A) mediated lymphocyte proliferation. The results indicate that at defined concn beryllium and zirconium salts can both act as lymphocyte mitogens and augment the functional responsiveness of immune cells, which may help explain the characteristic induction of delayed hypersensitivity and production of immunological granulomas by these metals in vivo."

Cell lines were derived from tumors developed in nude mice injected subcutaneously with BALB/c-3T3 cells morphologically transformed with beryllium sulfate. Using the Atlas mouse 1.2 cDNA expression microarray, the expression profiles of 1176 genes, belonging to several different functional categories, were studied in the tumor cells as well as in the nontransformed control cells. Expression of 18 genes belonging to two functional groups was found to be consistently and reproducibly different (at least twofold) in the tumor cells compared with the control cells. The functional groups and the differentially expressed genes are as follows: The cancer-related genes (nine genes) were the ets-related transcription factor activated by ras, colony-stimulating factor, A-myb, sky, cot1, c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and R-ras proto-oncogenes. The DNA synthesis, repair, and recombination genes (nine genes) were the DNA replication licensing factor MCM4, the DNA replication licensing factor MCM5, the DNA mismatch repair gene PMS2, the DNA excision repair gene, the DNA mismatch repair gene MSH2, the ultraviolet excision repair gene Rad23 DNA ligase 1, Rad51, and Rad52. The differential gene expression profile was confirmed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for the differentially expressed genes. In general, expression of the cancer-related genes was upregulated, while expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis, repair, and recombination was downregulated in the tumor cells compared with the control cells. Using c-fos and c-jun, two of the differentially expressed genes, as model genes, /researchers/ have found that in the nontransformed BALB/c-3T3 cells, the beryllium-induced transcriptional activation of these genes was dependent on pathways of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase and independent of reactive oxygen species. These results indicate that beryllium-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis are accompanied by and are possibly a product of alterations in expression of genes related to cancer and to DNA synthesis, repair, and recombination."

While an animal model of Be sensitization is not currently available, Be has exhibited adjuvant effects in animals. The effects of Be on BALB/c mice immunized with soluble leishmanial antigens (SLA) were investigated to determine if Be had adjuvant activity for IFN-gamma production, an indicator of the Th1 response. In this strain of Leishmania-susceptible BALB/c mice, a Th2 response is normally observed after in vivo SLA sensitization and in vitro restimulation with SLA. If interleukin-12 (IL-12) is given during in vivo sensitization with SLA, markedly increased IFN-gamma production and decreased IL-4 production are detected. /The authors/ show here that when beryllium sulfate (BeSO(4)) was added during in vivo sensitization of BALB/c mice with SLA and IL-12, significantly increased IFN-gamma production and decreased IL-4 production from lymph node and spleen cells were detected upon in vitro SLA restimulation. No specific responses were observed to Be alone. Lymph node and spleen cells from all mice proliferated strongly and comparably upon in vitro restimulation with SLA and with SLA plus Be; no differences were noted among groups of mice that received different immunization regimens. In vivo, when Be was added to SLA and IL-12 for sensitization of BALB/c mice, more effective control of Leishmania infection was achieved. This finding has implications for understanding not only the development of granulomatous reactions but also the potential for developing Be as a vaccine adjuvant."
