            "Value": "3-Nitrophenol has a reported experimental BCF of 25 in fish(1). An estimated BCF of 10 was calculated in fish for 3-nitrophenol(SRC), using a log Kow of 2.00(2) and a regression-derived equation(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low."

No biodegradation of 3-nitrophenol was observed under denitrifying conditions during a 30 day incubation period(3). 3-Nitrophenol was not degraded in a primary digesting sludge under methanogenic conditions during a 90 day incubation period(4). In an anaerobic biofilter implementation, 3-nitrophenol was largely converted (65-92% removal efficiency) to aminophenol(5). Using river water from the Songhua River in China and a sealed-bottle biodegradation method, 3-nitrophenol had a 5-day theoretical BOD of 37%(6). In another sealed-bottle test using bacteria from the Songhua River in China, 3-nitrophenol was found to be readily biodegradable with a first-order degradation rate of 0.54/day(7)."

            "Value": "A single measured Koc of 48 has been reported for 3-nitrophenol(1). Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(2), the Koc of 3-nitrophenol can be estimated to be 290(SRC). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that 3-nitrophenol is expected to have high to moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of 3-nitrophenol is 8.36(4), indicating that this compound will partially exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Experimental Koc data for other nitrophenol isomers(6-9) indicate 3-nitrophenol may be more mobile in the anionic form than in the neutral form(SRC)."
