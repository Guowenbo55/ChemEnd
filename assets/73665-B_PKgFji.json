Fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled p-MSNs were used to track particle distribution, and four hours after leaf treatment, nanoparticles were detected in leaves, stems, petioles, and roots, demonstrating translocation. Fourteen days later, high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure prochloraz and metabolite levels in different plant parts. Compared to the conventional suspension concentrate, p-MSNs had similar fungicidal activity against the target pathogen but showed better deposition performance in cucumber plants. Final residue levels of prochloraz in cucumbers were below maximum residue levels, indicating low risk from p-MSNs application to plants. Therefore, nanotechnology loading of pesticides onto particles like p-MSNs can enhance delivery and performance in plants.",

To enhance the chemical control of BRRD and prevent the emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study examined the control efficacy and systemic activity of fungicides with various modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with different modes of action were tested for their inhibitory effects on 39 P. noxius isolates from multiple regions. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (target-site G1) exhibited colony growth inhibition of P. noxius by 99.9% to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7% to 99.8% at 1 ppm. Another effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings, with cyproconazole and tebuconazole being the most efficiently absorbed by roots and transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments indicated that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD compared to mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Since all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered over trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.",
