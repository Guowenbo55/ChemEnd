            "Value": "AEROBIC: 2,4-D is readily and rapidly degraded in soil(1). The kinetics of 2,4-D disappearance suggest that microorganisms are responsible(1). The rate will depend on a number of factors including presence of acclimated organisms, nutrient levels, moisture level, temperature, and concentration of 2,4-D(1-3). Typical half-lives range from less than 1 day to more than several weeks under the conditions used(4-8). Degradation with a mixture of microorganisms from activated sludge, soil and sediments lead to half-lives of 1.8-3.1 days under aerobic conditions(4,9). Particular species of microorganisms, of various types, have been isolated and shown to degrade phenoxyacetic acid herbicides in pure culture(1). Degradation of the phenoxyacetic acids proceeds by two main pathways(1). These are via a hydroxyphenoxy acetic acid intermediate or via the corresponding phenol(1). Warm, moist conditions and addition of organic matter stimulate degradation of 2,4-D(7). The breakdown of 2,4-D in two types of soil was investigated under dry and moist conditions and at two different temperatures(7). Generally, 2,4-D disappeared more rapidly from moist soil; after 14 days of a slow rate of disappearance, however, the removal rate from dry, sandy soil increased(7). Numbers of organisms degrading 2,4-D were initially much lower in sandy than in clay loams(7). However, numbers increased rapidly in sandy soils after the addition of the herbicide and, as a result, 2,4-D was eventually degraded more rapidly in sandy than in clay loams(7). In moist conditions, at 25 \u00b0C, the half-life of 2,4-D was 7 days or less, whereas in dry conditions, at 35 \u00b0C, it could be as long as 250 days(7). These latter conditions are unlikely to apply in most natural conditions where 2,4-D is likely to be used(7). First-order kinetics were observed for the degradation of 2,4-D in sandy loam and muck soils from Malaysia(10). Short half-lives were observed for 2,4-D in aerobic (3.4 days) muck soils(10)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Using sewage-sludge bacteria incubated with 2,4-D, it was found that nearly all of the herbicide had disappeared after 7 days(1). Subsequent additions of 2,4-D led to destruction of the compound without a lag period; this suggests selection for organisms capable of degrading the compound(1). Similar results were obtained using bacteria from soil(1). The time needed for the disappearance of 90% of the added 2,4-D was 14 days with soil inocula(1). 2,4-D added subsequently was reduced by 70% within 3 to 4 days(1). Various tropical soils were used in the experiment and all showed a high capacity for degrading 2,4-D(1). The persistence of 2,4-D applied at recommended rates in agricultural soils in Canada was determined(2). In all but one soil, a sandy loam, the concentration had declined by 50% within 7 days(2). In another study, degradation of 2,4-D was slower in acid soils(3). It took 6 weeks for 50% of the 2,4-D to disappear from the soil and 7% was still left after 24 weeks(3). In water-logged soil, there was reduced degradation of the herbicide(3). 2,4-D applied at about 1.5 mg/kg was readily degraded in soil(4). Adding extra carbon in the form of dried, digested sewage sludge had a short-term effect in enhancing degradation of the compound(4). The half-life of 2,4-D degradation in cultures of soil microorganisms at different pH was measured(5). In the pH range of 8.5 to 5.0, the half-life changed little, ranging from 5 to 8 days(5). At pH 4.5, the half-life increased to 21 days and, at pH 4.0, increased further to 41 days(5). 2,4-D treatment increased the numbers of soil microorganisms capable of metabolizing 2,4-D as the sole carbon source and those capable of co-metabolizing the herbicide(6); this increase was dependent on the concentration of 2,4-D used(6). At 2,4-D concentrations between 5 and 50 mg/L, there was a significant increase in the numbers of organisms metabolizing 2,4-D, and at 5 mg/L there was a very pronounced increase in organisms co-metabolizing the compound(6). At much higher (500 mg/L) or much lower (1.2 ug/L) 2,4-D concentrations, there was no increase in the numbers of either metabolizing or co-metabolizing organisms(6). 2,4-D, present at 100 mg/L, reached 2% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(7)."

In a second series of experiments, different formulations of 2,4-D were added to alder litter(1). About 50% of the free acid of 2,4-D was degraded within 15 days(1). 2,4-D was added to inocula of municipal sewage and the biological oxygen depletion (BOD) was monitored as a measure of degradation(2). The herbicide was added to carbon-depleted inocula such that the 2,4-D represented the sole carbon source(2). Less than 5% of the available oxygen was depleted, indicating poor biodegradation of 2,4-D because of low numbers of organisms capable of degrading the herbicide as their sole carbon source(2). A separate study showed that 2,4-D was not toxic to microorganisms in sewage(2)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The degradation rate of 2,4-D in river water is related to the nutrient levels, sediment load, and dissolved organic carbon content of the water(1). Half-lives in river water of 18 to over 50 days (clear water) and 10 to 25 days (muddy water) with lag times of 6 to 12 days have been reported(1). The lag phase has been explained as the time for the small population of degrader organisms to become sufficiently numerous to cause detectable degradation of the chemical(2). The extent of mineralization in lake water was 72% in 60 days and was affected by levels of both inorganics and organics(3). Degradation is poor in oligotrophic water and where high 2,4-D concentrations are present(4) and 2,4-D was not mineralized in water from 2 of 3 lakes tested(5). A pilot study of seasonal changes in the capacity of river water in Western Australia to degrade 2,4-D indicated clear seasonal differences in both river water concentrations of the herbicide and the degrading capacity of river water(6). Rivers receiving agricultural run-off degraded 2,4-D better than those receiving run-off principally from forests(6). This was presumed to be the result of the preconditioning of organisms to the herbicide(6). The degrading ability of microbial communities taken from sediment cores from freshwater, estuarine, and marine sites was investigated(7). Some cores were pre-exposed to 2,4-D(7). Cores from freshwater sites showed increased degradation of 2,4-D after pre-exposure to the compound, whereas estuarine and marine cores did not show this effect(7). The adaptation of freshwater cores was maximal after 2 weeks and no longer detectable 6 weeks after pre-exposure(7). Oxidation of 81-85% 2,4-D in 24 hrs (based on BOD) was observed in lake bottom muds(8). Biodegradation rates ranged from 5-750 ug/day when 2,4-D, present at 10-1000 ug/g dry weight, was incubated in sediment samples from the River Ythan, Northeast-Scotland. Mineralization was mostly completed within 30 days(9)."

To test whether maturation inhibition was dependent on protein kinase A, an endogenous maturation inhibitor, oocytes were microinjected with PKI, a specific PKA inhibitor, and exposed to 2,4-D. Oocytes failed to mature, suggesting that 2,4-D is not dependent on PKA activity and likely acts on a downstream target, such as Mos. De novo synthesis of Mos, which is triggered by mRNA poly(A) elongation, was examined. Oocytes were microinjected with radiolabelled in vitro transcripts of Mos RNA and exposed to progesterone and 2,4-D. RNA analysis showed progesterone-induced polyadenylation as expected but none with 2,4-D. 2,4-D-activated MAPK was determined to be cytoplasmic in localization studies but poorly induced Rsk2 phosphorylation and activation. In addition to inhibition of the G2/M transition, 2,4-D caused abrupt reduction of H1 kinase activity in MII phase oocytes. Attempts to rescue maturation in oocytes transiently exposed to 2,4-D failed, suggesting that 2,4-D induces irreversible dysfunction of the meiotic signaling mechanism."

The direct involvement of 2,4-D in the formation of the adduct has also been demonstrated in vitro, using liver mitochondrial preparations exposed to (14)C-UL-2,4-D. Radiolabeled protein separated by SDS-PAGE and afterwards electroeluted showed a single labeled protein of 52 kD. When mitochondria exposed to radiolabeled xenobiotic were devoid of their outer membrane, the specific activity observed suggest that protein involved in covalent interaction belongs to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

TCDD was the most potent inducer for CYP1 enzyme mRNA and for the 2- and 4-hydroxylation of E(2). 2,4-D and DED induced similar responses, but less than that of TCDD."

In the acute study, gavage with 250 mg/kg test material caused slight transient gait and coordination changes and clearly decreased motor activity at the time of maximal effect on the day of treatment (day 1). Mild locomotor effects occurred in one mid-dose rat (75 mg/kg), on Day 1 only. No gait, coordination, or motor activity effects were noted by day 8.

Nonlinear toxicokinetic behavior was shown at high doses; the renal clearance saturation threshold for 2,4-D was exceeded markedly in females and slightly exceeded in males. Exposure was 4 weeks premating, 7 weeks postmating for P1 males and through lactation for P1 females. F1 offspring were examined for survival and development, and at weaning, pups were divided in cohorts, by sex and dose, and by systemic toxicity (10), DNT (10), DIT (20), and reproductive toxicity (? 23). Remaining weanlings were evaluated for systemic toxicity and neuropathology (10-12). Body weight decreased during lactation in high-dose P1 females and in F1 pups. Kidney was the primary target organ, with slight degeneration of proximal convoluted tubules observed in high-dose P1 males and in high-dose F1 males and females. A slight intergenerational difference in kidney toxicity was attributed to increased intake of 2,4-D in F1 offspring. Decreased weanling testes weights and delayed preputial separation in F1 males were attributed to decreased body weights. Endocrine-related effects were limited to slight thyroid hormone changes and adaptive histopathology in high-dose GD 17 dams seen only at a nonlinear toxicokinetic dose. 2,4-D did not cause reproductive toxicity, DNT, or DIT. The \"No Observed Adverse Effect Level\" for systemic toxicity was 300 ppm in both males (16.6 mg/kg/day) and females (20.6 mg/kg/day), which is approximately 6700- to 93 000-fold higher than that reported for 2,4-D exposures in human biomonitoring studies."

Exposure was 4 weeks premating, 7 weeks postmating for P1 males and through lactation for P1 females. F1 offspring were examined for survival and development, and at weaning, pups were divided in cohorts, by sex and dose, and by systemic toxicity (10), DNT (10), DIT (20), and reproductive toxicity (? 23). Remaining weanlings were evaluated for systemic toxicity and neuropathology (10-12). Body weight decreased during lactation in high-dose P1 females and in F1 pups. Kidney was the primary target organ, with slight degeneration of proximal convoluted tubules observed in high-dose P1 males and in high-dose F1 males and females. A slight intergenerational difference in kidney toxicity was attributed to increased intake of 2,4-D in F1 offspring. Decreased weanling testes weights and delayed preputial separation in F1 males were attributed to decreased body weights. Endocrine-related effects were limited to slight thyroid hormone changes and adaptive histopathology in high-dose GD 17 dams seen only at a nonlinear toxicokinetic dose. 2,4-D did not cause reproductive toxicity, DNT, or DIT.

Catalase activity and TBARs were not modified by herbicide exposure although TAC was significantly decreased at 100mg/kg/d of both pure and formulated compound. Thus, 2,4-D does not seem to induce oxidative stress during early pregnancy in mice at the doses administered, indicating that this mechanism is probably not involved in mediating herbicide toxicity at these dose levels.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 2,4-D in mouse liver on chromosomes as well as hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) which are required for the generation of the pyridine nucleotide pool. The experiments were carried out with a 2,4-D group, an ethanol control for 2,4-D, and saline group for ethanol control group on three generations of mice. Only female parents were given 2,4-D during the gestation period, lactation period and for 33 days following the lactation period. In females of the first cross, 2,4-D caused a significant increase in the activity of LDH, and ethanol alone caused a significant increase in the activities of HK and LDH. In the male offspring of the first cross maternal, 2,4-D caused a significant increase in the activity of LDH, and ethanol alone caused a significant decrease in the activity of 6PGD.

To measure milk ejection, the litter was separated from the mother at the 11th day of lactation during 8hr, returned to their mothers and allowed to suckle for a period of 15min. The procedure was repeated on 3 consecutive days until the end of treatment. The change in litter weight during the suckling period was taken as a measure of the amount of milk ejected during this period. The dams' serum prolactin (PRL), oxytocin (OT) and growth hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Both treatment regimens produced a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of milk ejected and circulating PRL and OT secreted in response to the suckling stimulus. Administration of OT before returning the pups restored the milk ejection, indicating no impairment in the capacity of the mammary gland to produce and secrete milk. In addition, dopamine levels were increased by the 2,4-D treatments in arcuate nucleus (ArN) and anterior lobe of pituitary gland (AL), while serotonin level was drastically decreased in ArN. 2,4-D treatment increased both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities in ArN. These results suggest that 2,4-D inhibits the suckling-induced hormone release, milk transfer to the litter at the central level, through a stimulation of hypothalamic NOS and dopamine and by an inhibition of hypothalamic serotonin transmission."

This chamber permits monitoring of the evoked compound action potential (CAP) of the nerve, a parameter that could be used to quantify the vitality of the nerve in normal conditions as well as when the nerve was exposed to the compounds under investigation. Thus, when the nerve was exposed to acetochlor, the EC(50) was estimated to be 0.22mM, while for 2,4,5-T the EC(50) was 0.90mM. Using the identical nerve preparation, the EC(50) of 2,4-D was estimated to be 3.80mM [Kouri, G., Theophilidis, G., 2002.

The ratio of the relative toxicity for acetochlor, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D was found to be 1:4:17.2. However, because it is well-known that the action of 2,4-D is dependent on the pH, the relative toxicity of the three compounds was tested at pH 3.3, since it has been found that the sciatic nerve of the frog is tolerant of such a low pH. Under these conditions, the EC(50) was 0.77mM (from 0.22mM at pH 7.2) for acetochlor, 0.20mM (from 0.90mM) for 2,4,5-T and 0.24mM (from 3.80mM at pH 7.2) for 2,4-D. Thus, the relative toxicity of the three compounds changed drastically to 1:0.25:0.31. This change in the relative toxicity is due not only to the increase in the toxicity of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D at low pH levels, but also to the decrease in the toxicity of acetochlor at pH 3.3."

The present research was aimed at studying effects of low and non-cytotoxic concentrations of 2,4-D on SHE cells in relation with carcinogenicity. Effects were studied on Syrian hamster morphological cell transformation, c-Myc expression - both at the gene and protein level - DNA damage and apoptosis. 2,4-D significantly induced cell transformation at 11.5 microM and 23 uM (i.e. 2.5 microg/mL and 5 ug/mL). An increase in the expression of the transcription factor c-Myc, measured by use of RT-PCR with respect to mRNA level and by Western blotting for protein level was registered at these concentrations, as well as genotoxic effects evaluated with the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. Consequences for apoptosis of 2,4-D treatment were also investigated. The fluorochrome acridine orange was used to study DNA fragmentation as a marker of apoptosis. No effect on apoptosis was found at 2,4-D concentrations that induced cell transformation. This was confirmed by the unchanged expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, two regulator genes of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. /These/ results demonstrate the transforming and genotoxic effects of low concentrations of 2,4-D in mammalian cells.

In this study, neuronal morphology and biochemical events in rat cerebellar granule cell (CGC) cultures have been analyzed to define some of the possible mechanisms involved in 2,4-D-induced cell death. For that purpose, amphetamine (AMPH) that has been shown to accelerate the recovery of several functions in animals with brain injury has been used as a pharmacologycal tool and was also investigated as a possible protecting agent. Addition of 2,4-D to CGC cultures produced a drastic decrease in cell viability, in association with an increased incidence of necrosis and apoptosis, and an increased level of reactive oxygen species, a decrease in glutathione content, and an abnormal activity of some enzymes with respect to the control group. The adverse effects of 2,4-D were partly attenuated in presence of AMPH. Some deleterious effects on several ultrastructural features of the cells, as well as the enhanced incidence of apoptosis, were partially preserved in AMPH-protected cultures as compared with those which were exposed to 2,4-D alone. The collected evidences (1) confirms the previously observed, deleterious effects of 2.4D on the same or a similar model; (2) suggests that the 2,4-D-induced apoptosis could have been mediated by or associated to an oxidative imbalance in the affected cells, and (3) shows some evidence of a protective effect of AMPH on 2,4-D-induced cell death, which could have been exerted through a reduction in the oxidative stress."

Progesterone, which acts through a membrane receptor, triggers meiotic maturation in full grown (stage VI) Xenopus oocytes, characterized by cytoskeletal reorganization, nuclear dissolution, chromosome condensation, and spindle formation. Biochemically, the Mos/MAPK/MPF signaling pathway is activated, in part dependent on translational activation of specific maternal mRNAs such as c-Mos. Light microscopy revealed unusual asymmetric morphotypes in oocytes exposed to 2,4-D alone characterized by a white spot and bulge, termed coning, in the animal pole where the germinal vesicle (nucleus) persisted intact. Treatment of oocytes with cytochalasin B, a microfilament inhibitor, blocked these morphotypes but nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, did not. Confocal microscopy showed that 2,4-D, itself, caused substantial depolymerization of perinuclear microtubules. Importantly, 2,4-D blocked progesterone-induced maturation as measured by the lack of nuclear breakdown, confirmed by the lack of Mos expression, MPF activation, and cytoplasmic polyadenylation of cyclin B1 mRNA. However, Western blot analysis and U0126 inhibitor studies showed that 2,4-D, either alone or in the presence of progesterone, induced MAPK phosphorylation through MAPKK. These results show that 2,4-D disrupts oocyte cytoskeletal organization and blocks maturation while stimulating an independent MAPK signaling pathway."

Clinical, laboratory and histopathological methods were used as indicators of toxicity. After acute exposure, the herbicide decreased locomotor activity and induced ataxia, sedation, muscular weakness (mainly of the hind quarters) and gasping for breath; increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), amylase activities and creatinine levels; decreased total protein (TP) and glucose levels; and increased hematocrit values. Subchronic and chronic 2,4-D exposures did not induce overt clinical signs or symptoms of intoxication. However, subchronic herbicide exposure increased AST activity and albumin and hematocrit values, and chronic exposure increased AST, AP and LDH activities, decreased amylase and glucose levels, but did not change hematocrit values. Chromatographic analysis of the serum of chronically exposed rats showed the presence of the herbicide; the amount found (3.76 + or - 1.16 ug/mL) suggested the absence of 2,4-D accumulation within the body. Although macroscopic or histopathological lesions were not observed in acutely, subchronically or chronically 2,4-D exposed rats, the laboratory data obtained suggest tissue injuries after dosing, since the results are considered early indicators of primarily hepatic and muscle tissue damage."

According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that 2,4-D is expected to have high to very high mobility in soil(SRC). The pKa of 2,4-D is 2.73(5). Anionic 2,4-D adsorption is affected by soil mineralogy (in particular iron and aluminum oxide content), exchangeable aluminum content, and soil phosphate content(6). Adsorption appears to increase with increasing organic content and decreasing pH of soil(7). Average mobility for 14 soils was 0.72 (Rf units), ranging from 0.41 for silty loam to 1.0 for sandy loam(7). In general little runoff occurs with 2,4-D or its amine salts and runoff behavior is the inverse of adsorption behavior(8). Thus, 2,4-D can be desorbed from mineral soils, but not from those containing much organic matter(8). Percolating water appears to be the principal means of movement and diffusion is important only for transport over very small distance(8). Geometric mean concentrations of leached 2,4-D ranged from 0.55-0.87 ug/L at a depth of 0.2 m following applications (rate 0.1-3.3 kg/ha-yr) of the herbicide and irrigation of home garden lawns(9). Upward movement of 2,4-D occurs when the soil surface dries or if rapid evaporation occurs(9). Thus, 2,4-D can be concentrated at the soil surface, where it can be photolyzed, transported by wind either on dust or in vapor form, or leached downwards again(9)."

The observations in the field indicated that common milkweed was susceptible to glyphosate but not to 2,4-D, while hemp dogbane showed the opposite response. It was found that both herbicides were absorbed more by common milkweed, which was attributed to factors such as less epicuticular wax, a thinner cuticle, a lower contact angle of the herbicide spray, and the presence of stomata and trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface. There were no significant differences in herbicide translocation between the two species, but glyphosate exhibited faster translocation compared to 2,4-D. Areas of high meristematic and metabolic activity accumulated more glyphosate than 2,4-D. Common milkweed showed rapid metabolism of 2,4-D in leaves above the treated leaves, whereas no detectable metabolism of 2,4-D was observed in hemp dogbane roots after 20 days. In contrast, 60% of the 2,4-D in common milkweed roots was metabolized.
