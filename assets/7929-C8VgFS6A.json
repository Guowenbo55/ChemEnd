Using a respirometric test, 91.8% biodegradation of 3-xylene, initially at 100 mg/L, was measured in 13 days with a lag period of 2 days(5). Half-lives of >97 and 24 days were reported for the biodegradation of 3-xylene in Texas and Oklahoma aquifers, respectively(6).

Xylene (mixed isomers), present at 100 mg/L, reached 100% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified xylene as readily biodegradable(8). Using OECD Guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) with a mixture of sewage, soil and natural water inoculum, 3-xylene reached 98% of its O2 consumption in 28 days which classified 3-xylene as readily biodegradable(9)."

Following the addition of nitrate, there was less complete removal of 3-/4-xylene however, the maximum removal rate was increased to 5.4 ug/L-hr(3). During biodegradation, methyl groups of 3-xylene were oxidized to carboxyls giving m-toluate followed by 2-hydroxy-5-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate(6). 3-Methylsalicylate was also reported as a metabolite from the biodegradation of 3-xylene(6). 3-Methylbenzyl fumaric acid and 3-methylbenzyl succinic acid(4) and 3-methylbenzoate and traces of 3-methylbenzaldehyde(7) were reported as metabolites from the biodegradation of 3-xylene under anaerobic conditions(4). Combined 3-/4-xylene was rapidly removed from aerobic strip-pit pond water (from coal mining) which had been amended with either nutrients or nutrients and sewage with less than 5% remaining after 12 days incubation; pond water alone required 43 days to reach 86% removal(5)."

Mortality in the mid-dose males and mid- and high-dose females attained statistical significance, but a significant trend was observed only in females. Mottled lungs and a failure of the lungs to collapse were observed in all mid- and high-dose animals that died early and in 2/3 of the lowdose males that died early but were not evident in any of the animals that survived to study termination. Histopathologic examination of the lungs from animals that died before study termination revealed foreign material in the alveoli in all but one animal. Therefore, these deaths were attributed to vehicle and/or compound aspiration. Clinical signs present throughout the study were limited to high levels of salivation prior to dosing in high-dose males and females. Body weight gains over the entire study period were decreased (p</=0.05) in mid- and high-dose males (89% and 75%, respectively, of controls) and high-dose females (85% of controls). Food consumption was likewise decreased (p</=0.05) in high-dose males during weeks 1-5 (90% of control levels) and in mid- and high-dose males during weeks 6 to 9 (92% of control levels for both groups).

The number of square borders crossed (locomotor activity), number of rearings (exploratory activity), and number of grooming episodes were recorded. In the passive avoidance test, animals were placed on a platform above the floor of the cage, and the time until the animal stepped off the platform was recorded in a series of six trials. In the first two trials, the animals were allowed to explore the cage for 60 seconds after stepping down; in the third trial, they received a series of footshocks after stepping off the platform. In trials 4, 5, and 6 the animals received no shocks and were allowed to stay on the floor for 1 minute after stepping off the platform. In the active avoidance test, the animals were trained to avoid an electric footshock by moving from one compartment of the cage to another when a sound was played. After successfully displaying avoidance behavior in four of five trials, the animals were considered to be trained. Postexposure evaluations determined the frequency of avoidance behavior in response to the same stimulus. No differences between control and exposed rats were seen in radial maze parameters (number of arm entries, arms omitted, or arms entered multiple times) either before exposure (7 days prior to exposure) or at 14 to 18 days after the termination of exposure. Similarly, no differences between groups were seen in open-field activity, examined on day 8 prior to exposure and day 25 postexposure, or in active avoidance (number of trials to avoidance criterion), examined on days 54 and 60 postexposure. Xylene-exposed rats showed a significantly shorter step-down time (trial 6 only; no difference in trials 1 to 5) in the passive avoidance test (examined on days 39 to 48 postexposure) and a significantly greater paw-lick latency in the hot plate behavior test (35 seconds vs. 10 seconds in control) (examined on days 50-51 postexposure), identifying 100 ppm as a LOAEL for neurobehavioral effects."

In this study, we examined whether organic solvents induce the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) which elicits Th2-type immune responses. Organic solvents were painted on the earlobes of BALB/c mice. The expression of TSLP in the ear was determined by ELISA. Xylene and toluene, but not chloroform or ethyl acetate, induced the expression of mRNA for TSLP in the earlobe tissue. Among the aromatic compounds, xylene, especially m-xylene, and trimethylbenzene caused apparent TSLP production. The level of TSLP in the xylene-treated earlobes reached a maximum at 24 hr, and TSLP was expressed in epithelial tissues. Production of TSLP was unaffected in mast cell-deficient W/W(v) mice but apparently diminished in TNF-a knockout mice and IL-4 receptor knockout mice. Repeated painting of xylene for 7 days induced an increase in the weight of cervical lymph nodes and expression of OX40 ligand, both of which were inhibited in TSLP receptor knockout mice. Xylene promoted the picryl chloride-induced thickening of the ear and IL-4 production, which were reversed in TSLP receptor knockout mice. Xylene induced TSLP production, resulting in an exacerbation of allergic inflammation. Thus, xylene might be a good tool for examining the roles of TSLP in eliciting allergy in experimental animals."

            "Value": "A Koc value of 166 was measured for 3-xylene using sandy aquifer materials with an foc ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0225(1). Measured Koc values in soil have been reported to be 182(2), 166 and 275(3). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that 3-xylene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. A Kp value (equilibrium-sorption coefficient) of 0.049 was measured for 3-xylene using a Borden soil column (98% sand, 0.29% organic carbon)(5). Benzene/toluene/xylene mixtures containing 3-xylene, were added to soil columns using aquifer material from the Cohansey aquifer (90% sand; 4.4% organic matter; pH-3.8); a partition coefficient of 8.74 was measured for 3-xylene(6). Adsorption coefficient values of 0.25, 0.23, and 0.02 were measured for 3-xylene, present in a benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene mixture, on montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite (all with low to no organic carbon present), respectively, using a batch equilibrium technique(7). More 3-xylene vapor was sorbed by air-dry than oven-dry soil (Evesham clay; air-dry soil contained 37 g organic C, 350 g clay, and 60 g water/kg oven-dry soil) at relative vapor pressures of 3-xylene exceeding 0.6; this suggests that the planar 3-xylene molecule is either readily adsorbed by interlayer sites in the air-dry soil (more sites potentially available than in oven-dry soil) or, as it is a fairly soluble molecule, that some will dissolve in the water film in air-dry soil(8). 3-Xylene has been observed to pass through soil unchanged in concentration at a dune-infiltration site on the Rhine River(9). A soil leaching column study estimated a 3-xylene Koc of 282 using a chromatographic methodology(10)."
