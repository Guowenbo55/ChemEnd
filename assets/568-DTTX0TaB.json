            "Value": "AEROBIC: Dibenzofuran was degraded in a few days in laboratory studies using subsurface  materials from a site in Conroe, TX which had been contaminated by creosote chemicals(1). The  rate of dibenzofuran degradation in studies using pristine subsurface materials was relatively  slow and not much faster than in autoclaved controls, 3.9% per week(1). Restriction of oxygen  supply in the non-sterile experiments significantly lowered the degradation rate(1). Once  microbial adaptation had occurred, dibenzofuran rapidly biotransformed as long as an adequate  oxygen supply was present(1). In a laboratory study, factors affecting the biodegradation of  polynuclear aromatics in creosote-contaminated groundwater (Conroe, TX) were examined(2). The  results under specific experimental conditions were (conditions, biodegradation rate, percent  removal): nutrient and dissolved oxygen addition, 57%/wk, 100%; dissolved oxygen addition,  37%/wk, 94%; oxygen limited, 11%/wk, 12%; sterile control, 0%/wk, 0%(2). Groundwater from a  moderately contaminated well was sparged with nitrogen to see the effect of dissolved  oxygen(2); at high (9.0 mg/l) and low (1.8 mg/l) dissolved oxygen, the biotransformation rate  was 65.4%/ day and 39.5%/ day, respectively(2). Dibenzofuran degraded in creosote-contaminated  groundwater at a rate of 18.2-50%/wk with a 1-3 day lag(3). Degradation at an uncontaminated  site was 12.3%/week with a 6 day lag. Degradation was faster in the more highly contaminated  groundwater(3). Dibenzofuran degraded in 5 days (3 day lag period) in single substrate batch  experiments conducted at 10 \u00b0C at pH 7 using groundwater (without aquifer material) from an  oil-contaminated site in Denmark(4). In an analogous experiment using a mixed substrate of  selected nitrogen-and oxygen-containing aromatic compounds, dibenzofuran degraded in 14.5 days  (13 day lag period)(4). When dibenzofuran was aerobically incubated with groundwater from the  periphery of a plume of contamination from creosote, 38% degradation occurred in one week;  dibenzofuran was not detected after 2 weeks(5). In shake flask studies of the biodegradation  of creosote components by indigenous microorganisms in contaminated groundwater at a Superfund  site in Pensacola, FL, 38% and 87% dibenzofuran loss was found after 5 and 14 days incubation,  respectively(6). In a study using aerobic groundwater microcosms, dibenzofuran at 3.3 mg/l  degraded completely after 278 days (lag period = 118 days) from an aquifer contaminated with  creosote compounds while from a background aquifer, benzofuran degraded after 42 days (lag  period = 29 days)(7)."

This was demonstrated at a creosote-contaminated site in Sweden where the concn of dibenzofuran at 8 sites, 652 mg/kg (mean), was reduced by an avg of 83% in 4 months(1). In laboratory studies of the biodegradation creosote constituents in soil from a abandoned wood-preserving facility in Pensacola, FL, 76% of dibenzofuran degraded in 1 week of incubation at 23 \u00b0C in special landfarming chambers(2). Analogous experiments performed with sediment resulted in 31% degradation in 12 weeks. Soil amendation did not have a marked effect of degradation(2). The reason suggested for the much slower degradation in sediment was the higher concn (190 times higher) and anaerobic source of the microorganisms in the sediment(2)."

            "Value": "SEDIMENT: Dibenzofuran is one of 28 aromatic compounds that has been  regularly detected in surface sediments from the Elizabeth River which flows  into the Chesapeake Bay(1). It was found in sediment from 2 of 5 Great Lakes tributaries at concns of 1.70 and 9.50 ppm(2). Concns detected in sediments  from various sites of a Norwegian fjord receiving industrial effluents ranged  from 6.7 to 918.7 ppb dry wt(3). Sediments collected from Lake Pontchartrain  in LA in 1980 contained levels of 1.9 ppb dry wt(4). Concns in sediments from  Eagle Harbor (near Puget Sound, WA) in 1983, which had been receiving  creosote effluents, ranged from 31 to 3600 ug/kg(5). One of 4 sediment  samples and none of the 5 soil samples collected in the vicinity of a manufacturing plant in Czechoslovakia that processes crude tar contained  dibenzofuran (detection limit = 50 ng/g)(6). The concn in the positive sediment sample was 1315.8 ng/g(6). It was detected in Black River Sediment  near Lorain, OH, the site of a coking plant associated with a steel mill(7).  In sediment samples taken from Lake Michigan (between 1991-1993), the concn  of dibenzofuran ranged from 9.59 to 41.25 ng/g dry wt(8). The concns of  dibenzofuran in sediment cores in northern New Jersey waterways were  (waterway, frequency of detection, median using half of detection limit as  concn in samples where substance was not detected (ppm), maximum detected  (ppm)): Arthur Kill (n=24), 21%, 0.65, 6.0; Hackensack River (n=12), 17%,  0.58, 0.45; Kill Van Kull (n=12), 0%, 0.44, -; Newark Bay (n=45), 7%, 0.60,  13; Passaic River (n=95), 0.3%, 0.65, 74(9). The frequencies of detection and  medians must be treated with caution due, in part, to the high variability in  detection limits (as high as 57 ppm for one sample) which were attributed to matrix effects in the highly contaminated sediment (9). Sediment collected from Georges Bank (off Martha's Vineyard, MA) in 1982 had dibenzofuran levels of 0.94 ug/kg(10). Dibenzofuran was detected, but not quantified in Kondo Bay, Japan, a body of water that received untreated industrial and municipal waste(11)."
