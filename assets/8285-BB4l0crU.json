    "Description": "Pentaerythritol is a tetrol that is neopentane in which one of the methyl hydrogens of all four methyl groups are replaced by hydroxy groups. It is a chemical intermediate used in the production of explosives, plastics, paints, appliances, and cosmetics. It has a role as a flame retardant and a laxative. It is a primary alcohol and a tetrol. It derives from a hydride of a neopentane.",

While some authors observed little or no biodegradation of pentaerythritol by their test methods(3-6), other investigators noted that the compound will readily biodegrade under certain test conditions(1-2). Most of the discrepancies in the results are due to the different conditions used in the test methods, such as difference in inocula, acclimation of inocula, period of incubation and the test methods used to measure biodegradation(1-2)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: When a modified Sturm test was used to determine the biodegradability, pentaerythritol showed 53-59% biodegradation on the basis of evolved carbon dioxide but biodegradation was 96-97% based on DOC removal(3) under otherwise similar conditions. The difference between the two test methods is that while the COD method did account for the carbon loss due to assimilation by the bacteria as biomass, the carbon dioxide evolution method did not(3). The lag or delay time for the biodegradation of pentaerythritol has been reported to be 3 to 15 days(1). Besides acclimation of the bacteria, an optimum concn of viable cells may be required for the biodegradation of pentaerythritol and this number is on the order of 10,000 viable cells/L(2)."
