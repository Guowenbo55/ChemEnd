            "Value": "Sulfuric acid aerosol toxicity is dependent on the hydrogen ion content of the aerosol. One mechanism by which sulfuric acid may produce its toxicity is by changing extracellular and intracellular pH. There is evidence that pH plays a critical role in growth control and cell differentiation, and that disrupting the control of pH may lead to adverse effects ... A sufficiently low pH is genotoxic to some cell systems. Therefore, a significant change in pH produced by sulfuric acid exposure could potentially lead to cellular changes if hydrogen ions reached susceptible targets. A preliminary in vitro study that exposed a human tracheal epithelial cell line to sulfuric acid aerosols of 0.75, 1.4, or 3.28 um for 10 minutes revealed that intracellular pH decreased, and, that at equal mass concentrations, the change in pH was greater for the smaller particle sizes."

            "Value": "Mechanisms of sulfuric acid-induced pulmonary injury have been studied. Atropine was administered to 12 guinea pigs in order to inhibit reflex-mediated bronchoconstriction and the animals were exposed to 32.6 mg/cu m sulfuric acid aerosol (MMAD /mass median aerodynamic diameter/ 1.0 um, relative humidity 70-90%) for 4 hr ... Unlike guinea pigs who were exposed to sulfuric acid without atropine pre-treatment, the atropine-treated animals had no signs of pulmonary injury, such as epithelial desquamation. It was concluded that pulmonary injury following sulfuric acid exposure may be due in part to mechanical forces generated during reflex-mediated bronchoconstriction."

            "Value": "The genotoxic effects of significantly lowered pH may contribute to the ability of sulfuric acid to produce respiratory tract tumors. It has also been postulated that sulfuric acid may promote carcinogenesis by inducing chronic tissue irritation ... Chronic inflammation results in the release of free radicals which have a genotoxic action. In addition, chronic inflammation may increase susceptibility to infection which may contribute to a carcinogenic response. However, the mechanism of carcinogenesis remains to be proven."

Sulfuric acid per se is not expected to be absorbed or distributed throughout the body. The acid will rapidly dissociate and the anion will enter the body electrolyte pool, and will not play a specific toxicological role."
