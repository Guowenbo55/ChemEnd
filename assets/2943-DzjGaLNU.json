            "Value": "Degradation of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate occurs by successive dealkylations of the two methyl groups at the ester linkages with the formation of monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate and tetrachloroterephthalic acid(1). 14C-dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate was added to soil or ground thatch and its degradation measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Degradation was faster in thatch than in soil; 55% and 25% dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate remained at 4 and 16 weeks, respectively, for thatch cultures. 96% and 78% dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate remained at 4 and 16 weeks, respectively, for soil cultures(1). Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate present in a 0.1%(w/w) dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate:soil mixture was measured following different temperature and soil moisture regimes. Soil at 10-15 \u00b0C and with low moisture (0.1 kg H2O/kg soil) showed a slow loss of this compound with a half-life of 105 days; soil at 20-30 \u00b0C and with over 0.2 kg H2O/kg soil showed a half-life for dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate of 11 days(2). The half-life values of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate for coarse, medium, and fine soil textures were 44, 15, and 32 days, respectively at optimal temperature and moisture conditions for microbial degradation(2)."

Metabolites were monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate which quickly hydrolyzed to the di-acid; there was no loss of the mono-acid metabolite over a 300 day period(1). Nearly 33% of added 14C-labeled dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate in Plainfield sand was lost within 15 days, only 25% of the 14C activity was the parent compound(2). Soil used to grow one-year pine seedlings showed a similar degradation pattern. Ten day old pine seedlings showed 20% of the total 14C activity was lost after 15 days, 30% of the 14C activity remaining was intact dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, 50% of the remaining activity was 14C labeled degradation products(2).

New York soil which had been treated for five previous years with dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (19 lb/acre annually) had nearly 3 times more actinomycetes present than soil which was untreated(2). Pure cultures were incubated for 96 hours with dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate(10, 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l) present as the sole carbon source and with one of twenty soil isolates of bacteria or actinomycetes. 25, 90, and 90% of the isolated actinomycetes were able to utilize dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate at concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l, respectively; 5, 15, and 15% of the isolated bacteria were able to utilize this compound at concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l, respectively(2).
