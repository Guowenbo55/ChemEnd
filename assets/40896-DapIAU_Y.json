Merr. \u2018Wells\u2019], common cocklebur (Xanthium pensylvanicum Wallr.), and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.). Absorption of 14C-mefluidide was greater through the foliage than the roots of all plant species. Rate of leaf absorption and translocation of 14C initially was greater in giant foxtail than in either soybean or common cocklebur, but these processes failed to increase greatly with time in giant foxtail. Absorption and translocation increased over time in soybean and common cocklebur. Soybean absorbed slightly greater quantities of 14C-mefluidide than common cocklebur, but by 8 days after labeling, common cocklebur translocated approximately 47% more radio-label out of the treated leaf than soybean. The foliar-applied 14C-label appeared to move in the phloem along with the assimilate stream in all species, mainly to areas of high metabolic activity. 14C was associated with the root systems and/or nutrient solutions of soybean and giant foxtail, but not of common cocklebur. Exuded material chromatographed as mefluidide. Movement of 14C-label in all root-treated plants appeared to be confined within the xylem with older tissue containing greater amounts of 14C than the younger tissue. Differences in selectivity between crop and weed species may be partially due to differential mefluidide absorption, translocation, and subsequent concentration in certain plant tissues.",

Penetration of acifluorfen into common cocklebur was unaffected by pretreatment with mefluidide. However, the 7-day mefluidide pretreatment of common cocklebur increased translocation of 14C into the upper leaves and decreased acifluorfen metabolism. Penetration and translocation of the radiolabel from 14C-acifluorfen in soybean was unaffected by pretreatment with mefluidide.
