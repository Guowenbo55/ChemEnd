            "Value": "Theophylline and aminophylline have been widely used as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase when examining the role of cAMP in regulating cell function. In reality, however, these phosphodiesterase inhibitors may have additional sites of action that could complicate the interpretation of the results. These additional sites of action could include antagonism of inhibitory adenosine autoreceptors and release of intracellular calcium. The purpose of the present study was to determine which of the above three is the primary mechanism by which theophylline and aminophylline affect transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction.  Quantal release measurements were made using intracellular recording techniques. A variety of drugs were used to elucidate this pathway. Isoproterenol, an adenylate cyclase activator, was first used to establish the effect of enhanced levels of cAMP. Theophylline application on its own or in the presence of a drug combination that blocked the adenosine receptor and phosphodiesterase pathways caused significant release depression, opposite to what is expected if it was functioning to enhance cAMP levels. However, when applied in the presence of a drug combination that blocked the adenosine receptor, phosphodiesterase and intracellular ryanodine calcium pathways, theophylline was unable to depress release. Therefore, it was concluded that the major mechanism of action of theophylline is depression of transmitter release by causing the release of intracellular calcium. Aminophylline application alone resulted in a significant enhancement of release. However, when coupled with an adenosine receptor blocker, the ability of aminophylline to enhance transmitter release was blocked, suggesting that its dominant mechanism of action is adenosine receptor inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that the use of theophylline and aminophylline is inappropriate when examining the role of cAMP at the mammalian neuromuscular junction."

            "Value": "Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects). While the mechanisms of action of theophylline  are  not  known  with  certainty,  studies  in  animals  suggest  that  bronchodilatation  is mediated by the inhibition of two isozymes of phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV)  while  non-bronchodilator  prophylactic  actions  are  probably  mediated  through  one  or  more different molecular mechanisms, that do not involve inhibition of PDE III or antagonism of adenosine receptors.  Some  of  the  adverse  effects  associated  with  theophylline  appear  to  be  mediated  by inhibition of PDE III (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and emesis) and adenosine receptor antagonism (e.g., alterations in cerebral blood flow).  Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. This action appears to be due to enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel. /Theophylline/"

To evaluate side effects of PDE inhibitors, this study analyzed changes in blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during and after intravenous aminophylline in the animal model of MAS. Oxygen-ventilated rabbits were given meconium intratracheally (25 mg/mL, 4 mL/kg) or saline. Thirty minutes later, the animals were treated by intravenous aminophylline (Syntophyllin, 2 mg/kg) or saline (sham-treated controls). A second dose of the treatment was given 2 h later. During (5 min) and immediately after (5 min) the treatment, and during 5 h after the treatment, mean blood pressure in the femoral artery (MAP), HR and HRV were evaluated. In meconium-instilled animals, increases in MABP, HR, and HRV were observed already 5 min after aminophylline administration, while in saline-instilled animals aminophylline increased HR and caused inconsistant changes in HRV parameters compared to sham-treated animals. Within 5 h after the treatment administration, MAP, HR, and HRV parameters gradually returned to the initial values. Concluding, intravenous aminophylline may lead to acute cardiovascular changes. Thus, if aminophylline is used for treatment of MAS, its possible cardiovascular effects should be considered, particularly in patients with cardiovascular instability."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Theophylline-associated convulsions are frequently exacerbated by fever, but the mechanisms behind it are still not completely understood. We investigated whether N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are involved in aminophylline (theophylline-2-ethylenediamine)-induced convulsions that are augmented by heat exposure-induced hyperthermia in mice. Mice exposed to 33 \u00b0C temperatures for 2 hr had significantly increased body temperature (0.94 \u00b0C). Heat exposure significantly decreased time required for the onset of convulsions induced by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of aminophylline (300 mg/kg). The shortened time for onset of convulsions was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) did not have any effect. The pro-convulsant action of NMDA (100-125 mg/kg, i.p.) was enhanced by the heat exposure of 33 \u00b0C. However, the pro-convulsant actions of picrotoxin (3-4 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, were not affected by increased temperatures. These results suggest that NMDA receptors in the brain play a role in aminophylline-induced convulsions, which are augmented by heat exposure-induced hyperthermia in mice."

We tested the hypothesis that aminophylline treatment may ameliorate the pulmonary and extrapulmonary effects of endotoxemia in a rat model. In anesthetized rats, a tracheotomy was performed along with catheterization of a femoral vein and artery. Anesthesia, fluid balance, and normothermia were maintained throughout the 6-h experiment. A stable hemodynamic and gas-exchange baseline was established at which time the rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group I received aminophylline (1 mg/kg) over 30 min followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr. Group II received a single dose of endotoxin (4 mg/kg) while Group III received both aminophylline and endotoxin as described for Groups I and II, respectively. Gas-exchange profiles, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were determined every 2 hr. At hour 6, the rats were euthanized and lung, kidney, and heart tissue were removed for determination of water content. As our control group, we utilized data from our previously published study involving an identical surgical procedure with normal saline. Endotoxemia produced characteristic respiratory and hemodynamic signs of sepsis including hypotension, hyperventilation, tachycardia, and renal and pulmonary edema. Aminophylline treatment failed to prevent these endotoxemia-induced respiratory and hemodynamic manifestations of sepsis, but significantly improved the acid-base imbalance that developed during surgical procedures in saline-treated control rats. Further studies are warranted to determine potentially beneficial doses of aminophylline and resulting theophylline serum concentrations under such septic conditions."

A physiological effect of these compounds is an elevation of the metabolic rate, but the mechanism of this increase is unclear. We have investigated the hypothesis that this elevation of metabolic rate in young animals is in part due to increased physical activity. Metabolic rate and spontaneous physical activity of weanling Fischer 344 rats were measured before and during 2 days of aminophylline administration. Our results show increased metabolic rate measured over 23 hr, concomitant with increased activity during treatment. Resting metabolic rate was not elevated. The results suggest that increased physical activity plays a major role in increasing metabolic rate during aminophylline treatment. Metabolic rate returned to control levels on the 2nd day of treatment despite a smaller but still significant elevation in physical activity. This suggests development of tolerance to the effects of aminophylline on activity together with adaptation to the metabolic effects of this drug."

Most of these seizures are difficult to control and are underappreciated compared to other drug toxicities. Despite a long clinical history of aminophylline-induced seizures, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to methylxanthine-induced seizure generation. The present study evaluated the possible involvement of free radicals in aminophylline induced seizures in rat. The rats were divided into two groups. The first group graded single doses of aminophylline from 100 to 300 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally. On the basis of the results aminophylline, a dose (300 mg/kg) producing tonic-clonic seizures and mortality in 100% animals was selected as control in the study. The second group were subjected to single antioxidant (Vitamin E or Vitamin C) or in combination for 45 days then single doses of aminophylline 300 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally to rats. Aminophylline induced convulsions in rats in a dose-dependent manner, and both incidence of seizure and mortality were maximum at 300 mg/kg and there was significant increase of free radical generation.

In 12-day-old rat pups there was an enormous increase of transition of the spike-and-wave type of ADs into the second, limbic type, a situation observed only exceptionally under control conditions. A prolongation of ADs was related to this transition (limbic ADs are always longer than spike-and-wave ones). Eighteen-day-old rats exhibit this transition less frequently but a marked prolongation of spike-and-wave ADs was recorded in a part of these animals forming a pattern of status lasting some tens of minutes. Aminophylline led only to a transient prolongation of spike-and-wave ADs in the oldest group. The transition into the limbic type of ADs was seen in this age group only exceptionally what is in contrast to age-matched controls in which this transition is common. The effect of aminophylline on cortical ADs which is most marked in the youngest group changes qualitatively during postnatal development."

From days 6-18 of gestation, each dose of theophylline (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day at a rate of 0.5 ml/kg/min) was administered i.v. to pregnant rabbits using an automatic infusion pump. Theophylline showed reversible toxicity: accelerated respiration, sluggish startle reactions, dilation of the auricular vessels and polyuria were observed in dams treated with 60 mg/kg/day but not in animals given 15 or 30 mg/kg/day. Fetuses from the dam group treated with 60 mg/kg/day exhibited teratogenic toxicity such as cleft palate and skeletal variation of the 13th rib. Fetal toxicity was also observed including abortion, increased number of late deaths and decreased body weight appearing on day 29 of gestation. No toxicity was observed in fetuses from the dam group treated with 15 or 30 mg/kg/day. However, in the 30 and 60 mg/kg/day theophylline-treated groups, maternal plasma concentrations (Cmax) during the treatment period were approximately 56 and 106 ug/mL, respectively. It is therefore suggested that the risk of teratogenic and fetal toxicity caused by theophylline is dependent on its dosage. In conclusion, caution should be taken when administering theophylline or aminophylline to pregnant individuals at doses that could result in high neonate peak blood levels. /Theophylline/"

Pretreatments with antioxidants, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol and melatonin, all dose dependently reduced seizure incidence and mortality after aminophylline, whereas, antioxidant depletion potentiated such excitotoxicity. Pretreatments with the NO synthase inhibitors, L-NAME and 7-NI blocked aminophylline seizures, whereas, the NO mimetics, L-arginine and glyceryl trinitrate, tended to potentiate this phenomenon. Sub-effective doses of aminophylline (100 mg/kg) also induced seizures when combined with subthreshold intensity of electroshock, and such seizures were similarly antagonized by the antioxidants and NO synthase inhibitors. Biochemical assay of brain homogenates showed that aminophylline seizures were associated with enhancements in brain MDA and NOx (NO metabolites) levels, whereas, SOD activity was reduced, and these changes were attenuated after melatonin and L-NAME pretreatments.
