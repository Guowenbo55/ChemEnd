    "Description": "Flutolanil is a member of the class of benzamides, obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid with the amino group of 3-(ispropyloxy)aniline. A fungicide used to control a range of pathogens especially Rhizoctonia spp. on rice, turf and other crops. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzamides, an aromatic ether, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a benzanilide fungicide.",

The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",
