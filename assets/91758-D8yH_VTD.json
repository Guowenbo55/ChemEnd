The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",

Fosthiazate was rapidly taken up by tomato plants, with nearly one-third of the finally absorbed quantity taken up in the first half an hour. The translocation of fosthiazate to the shoot part was under metabolic control during the initial stage of uptake. The kinetics of uptake both in the presence and absence of DNP conformed well to the dual phase than a single phase. In the presence of DNP, the uptake capacity (Vmax1) for the initial phase suffered, approximately three-fold reduction occurred in comparison to the absence of DNP, while Vmax2 for the latter phase was statistically similar to the value observed in the absence of DNP, signifying the metabolic dependence of the initial uptake phase. Autoradiography indicated that fosthiazate in the tomato plants tends to accumulate in the roots and at the root-shoot junction. In the shoot, it is accumulated in the older leaves, especially near the leaf tip and margins.",
