    "Description": "Difenoconazole is a member of the class of dioxolanes that is 1,3-dioxolane substituted at position 2 by 2-chloro-4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl and 1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl groups. A broad spectrum fungicide with novel broad-range activity used as a spray or seed treatment. It is moderately toxic to humans, mammals, birds and most aquatic organisms. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aromatic ether, a dioxolane, a member of triazoles, a cyclic ketal, a conazole fungicide and a triazole fungicide.",

The dissipation of the three compounds in soil followed the first-order kinetics and DFZ showed greater half-lives than IMI and THX. Detection of the three compounds in rice tissues indicated that rice plants could take up and accumulate these pesticides. The concentrations of IMI and THX detected in leaves (IMI,10.0 and 410 mg/kg dw; THX, 23.0 and 265 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in roots (IMI,1.37 and 69.3 mg/kg dw; THX, 3.19 and 30.6 mg/kg dw), which differed from DFZ. The DFZ concentrations in roots (15.6 and 79.1 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in leaves (0.23 and 3.4 mg/kg dw). The bioconcentration factor (BCF), representing the capability of rice to accumulate contaminants from soil into plant tissues, ranged from 1.9 to 224.3 for IMI, from 2.0 to 72.3 for THX, and from 0.4 to 3.2 for DFZ at different treated concentrations. Much higher BCFs were found for IMI and THX at 10FR treatment than those at FR treatment, however, the BCFs of DFZ at both treatments were similar. The translocation factors (TFs), evaluating the capability of rice to translocate contaminants from the roots to the aboveground parts, ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 for stems and from 0.02 to 9.0 for leaves. The tested compounds were poorly translocated from roots to stems, with a TF below 1. However, IMI and THX were well translocated from roots to leaves. Clothianidin (CLO), the main metabolite of THX, was detected at the concentrations from 0.02 to 0.5 mg kg 1 in soil and from 0.07 to 7.0 mg kg 1 inplants. Concentrations of CLO in leaves were almost 14 times greater than those in roots at 10*FR treatment.",
