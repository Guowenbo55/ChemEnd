            "Value": "AEROBIC: 3-Chlorophenol undergoes aerobic biodegradation by reductive dechlorination followed by ring cleavage(1). Aerobic biodegradation half-lives in soil samples were measured as 15 and 21 days(2). The half-life of 3-chlorophenol in water and soil were reported as 36 and 160 days, respectively(4). 3-Chlorophenol was completely biodegraded in 100 days with sediment obtained from the Hudson River(3). 3-Chlorophenol was biodegraded 5% in batch reactors using unacclimated microorganisms isolated from soil(4). 6% biodegradation was reported in 40 days in water from a farm stream at 20 \u00b0C and 56% biodegradation was reported in sediment from farm stream at 20 \u00b0C in 30 days; 14% degradation in 30 days was observed in sterile sediments(5). Degradation in clay loam soil under aerobic conditions of 87% 3-chlorophenol reported in 160 days with 31% degradation in sterile control(6). 3-Chlorophenol was not completely removed in 72 and 47 days in nutrient media seeded with Dunkirk and Mardin silt loam suspensions, respectively(7). No degradation was reported using settled wastewater solids seed incubated for 7 days followed by 3 weekly subcultures(8). Incubation of 3-chlorophenol with aerobic batch mixed cultures at 30 \u00b0C resulted in the incomplete degradation of 3-chlorophenol. Degradation peaked after 48 hours and was 100% complete after 238 hours with only 38.0% chloride release, indicating that ortho-cleavage pathway is needed in order to completely biodegrade 3-chlorophenol. Accumulation of the meta-cleavage product 3-chlorocatechol became toxic to the meta-cleavage enzyme(9). 3-Chlorophenol reached 31.7% of its BOD in river water obtained from the Jilin section of the Songhua River, China. A test concn of 2 mg/L (based on TOD) was tested at 15-20 \u00b0C, pH 6.8-7.0, and a dissolved oxygen concn of 8.0 mg/L, using standard iodometric tritration(10)."

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: 3-Chlorophenol undergoes anaerobic degradation by hydroxylation to 3-chlorocatechol followed by dechlorination(1). The anaerobic biodegradation rate constant of 3-chlorophenol in marine sediment was measured as 0.02 days-1, corresponding to a half-life of about 36 days(2). Degradation of 3-chlorophenol in clay loam soil under anaerobic conditions was 37% in 160 days vs 15% in sterile control(3). 3-Chlorophenol was degraded by anaerobic columns of actively methanogenic aquifer material contaminated by landfill leachate but not by nonmethanogenic aquifer material(4). Complete degradation was reported in 7 weeks with incubation using municipal sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions(5). Incubation of 3-chlorophenol with sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions gave the following results: complete disappearance of 3-chlorophenol in 6 weeks with an approximately 3 week lag period using unacclimated sludge; approximately 100% loss of 3-chlorophenol in 7 or 12 days using sludge acclimated to 3- or 4-chlorophenol, respectively; no degradation in 32 days using sludge acclimated to 2-chlorophenol(6). 3-Chlorophenol biodegrades in the absence of oxygen under methanogenic, sulfidogenic, and iron-reducing conditions(7). 3-Chlorophenol degraded completely in <15 hours (no lag phase) in an anaerobic propionate enrichment culture at 35 \u00b0C(8). 3-Chlorophenol (100 ug/L) was persistent (lag phase >30 days) in adapted anaerobic, non-adapted anaerobic, and aerobic sand and gravel after 4 weeks in a model ecosystem consisting of a laboratory filter operating with groundwater. Complete metabolism after 7 days was observed only when 3-chlorophenol (100 ug/L) was applied to a gravel filter that favored microbial degradation and adapted to phenol degradation(9). The half-life of 3-chlorophenol in anaerobic lake sediment (<1% organic matter) was reported as 173 days with a 2 day lag period(10). 3-Chlorophenol degraded in phenol-enriched, acclimated methanogenic culture at a much higher rate than in unacclimated digester sludge culture and dechlorinated 2-chlorophenol faster(11)."

According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that 3-chlorophenol is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC). The pKa of 3-chlorophenol is 9.12(3), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Chlorophenols can be irreversibly immobilized by covalent bonding to soil organic matter (SOM). Irreversible binding increased with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and under anoxic conditions(5)."
