It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an anxiolytic drug. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepinone and an organochlorine compound.",

            "Value": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acts on GABAA receptors to regulate vigilance, anxiety, muscle tension, epileptogenic activity and memory functions. Benzodiazepines modulate GABA-evoked chloride currents through a binding site on the GABAA receptor-operated chloride channel. GABA agonists and benzodiazepine agonists simultaneously enhance the binding of the other to its receptor. Benzodiazepine binding appears to shift the GABA receptor from a low affinity state to a high affinity state and also stabilizes the receptor in a conformation that permits the ion channel to remain open. Similarly, GABA binding also enhances benzodiazepine agonist binding to its receptor via the same mechanism. Thus, GABA receptor agonist and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are positive allosteric effectors for each other."

            "Value": "The exact sites and mode of action of the benzodiazepines are unknown. The drugs appear to act at the limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS, producing anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. The effects of benzodiazepines may be mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Benzodiazepines are capable of producing all levels of CNS depression from mild sedation to hypnosis to coma. /Benzodiazepines/"

            "Value": "Anxiolytic and possibly paradoxical CNS stimulatory effects of benzodiazepines are postulated to result from release of previously suppressed responses (disinhibition). After usual doses of benzodiazepines for several days, the drugs cause a moderate decrease in rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement rebound does not occur when the drugs are withdrawn. Stage 3 and 4 sleep are markedly reduced by usual doses of the drugs; the clinical importance of these sleep stage alterations has not been established. /Benzodiazepines/"

            "Value": "Benzodiazepines appear to produce skeletal muscle relaxation predominantly by inhibiting spinal polysynaptic afferent pathways, but the drugs may also inhibit monosynaptic afferent pathways. The drugs may inhibit monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes by acting as inhibitory neuronal transmitters or by blocking exitatory synaptic transmission. The drugs may also directly depress motor nerve and muscle function. /Benzodiazepines/"
