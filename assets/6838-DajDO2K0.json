            "Value": "AEROBIC: The half-life of N-nitrosodiphenylamine in 86 g sludge/kg soil produced from a wood preserving process was determined to be 88.9 days, from an initial concentration of 697 mg/kg and a final concentration of 19 mg/kg after 287 days; the half-life of N-nitrosodiphenylamine in 172 g sludge/kg soil produced from a wood preserving process was determined to be 166.4 days, from an initial concentration of 887 mg/kg and a final concentration of 58 mg/kg after 287 days(1). In a static biodegradation test that used domestic wastewater as the inoculum, the N-nitrosodiphenylamine biodegraded in the original culture and first, second and third subcultures after 7 days incubation per culture was: (10 mg/L initial concentration N-nitrosodiphenylamine) 47, 63, 95, and 98%; at 5 mg/L initial concentration N-nitrosodiphenylamine: 87, 100, 92, and 100%, respectively(2). Removal of N-nitrosodiphenylamine at two industrial activated sludge treatment plants averaged >84% at an average influent concentration of 5.3 ug/L(3). At an industrial aerated lagoon, 67% of an initial N-nitrosodiphenylamine concentration of 3 ug/L was removed(3). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine, added to soil at a concentration of 354 ug/g soil, was degraded 68% by the end of a 30 day incubation at 30 \u00b0C in the dark(3). In soil amended with wheat straw (organic matter content increased from 2.16 to 17.5%), N-nitrosodiphenylamine disappeared completely by day 10 of the incubation(4). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its Theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(5)."
