It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, an EC 4.3.1.24 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) inhibitor, a vasodilator agent, an antifungal agent, a flavouring agent, a plant metabolite and a sensitiser. It is a 3-phenylprop-2-enal and a member of cinnamaldehydes.",

Rats and mice of both sexes received CNMA by daily corn oil gavage (for 2 wk), or in microencapsulated form in feed (2 wk for rats, 3 wk for mice). Feed formulations contained 0-10% CNMA microcapsules, equivalent to approximate daily doses of 0-3000 mg CNMA/kg bw for rats and 0-10,000 mg CNMA/kg bw for mice. Concentrations were chosen to deliver CNMA doses approximately equal to doses in the gavage study. Gavage doses of 2620 mg/kg/day and above in mice and 940 mg/kg/day and above in rats produced nearly 100% mortality; there were no deaths in animals receiving microencapsulated CNMA. Rats and mice receiving CNMA in feed showed a dose-related decrease in bw gain, which was accompanied in rats by hypoplastic changes in reproductive organs and accessory sex glands. CNMA administration by either route caused hyperplasia of the forestomach mucosa. These results demonstrate that microencapsulation in feed can present a useful alternative to gavage dosing for repeated-dose or prolonged-exposure studies, in that (1) the toxic effects of CNMA were similar after gavage dosing and after administration in microencapsulated form in feed, (2) ingestion of chemical in the feed more closely approximates human exposures, and (3) microencapsulation allows the delivery of higher net doses of chemical, while avoiding the acutely toxic effects of a bolus dose."

Using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535 (hisG46 uvrB rfa) and TA100 (TA1535/pKM101), the effects of cinnamaldehyde on spontaneous reversions and reversions induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide(4NQO) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been examined. To observe the effect of cinnamaldehyde in the absence of functional muc genes, a third strain, TA1535/pGW201 (pKM101 muc140: :Tn5) was included in the testing. Modifications of the standard Ames test procedures and direct-plating techniques were employed to study the \"antimutagenic\" response exerted by cinnamaldehyde. In all strains tested, concentrations of cinnamaldehyde up to 25 micrograms/mL slightly decreased the number of spontaneous reversions and induced reversions were more markedly reduced. The decreases in the numbers of 4NQO-induced revertants were greater than those decreases which occurred for EMS-induced reversions. There was no effect on viability in 1% (v/v) nutrient broth supplemented minimal medium containing 5-25 micrograms/ml of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde did not display any mucAB dependent or independent specificity against the mutagens used. On minimal medium supplemented with histidine and biotin, concentrations of cinnamaldehyde above 10 micrograms/ml were lethal for the strains tested. When the test medium was supplemented with 1-5% (v/v) liquid nutrient broth, viability was not affected at concentrations up to 25 micrograms/mL. For both TA100 and TA1535 the presence of 20 micrograms/mL of cinnamaldehyde in 1% (v/v) liquid nutrient broth-supplemented minimal glucose broth extended the lag phase for 2-4 hr with no effect on survival. Depending on the test procedure employed, decreases in numbers of revertants may reflect lethality rather than antimutagenesis. When used to test for antimutagenesis rather than mutagenesis, modifications of the standard Ames test procedure may mimic an antimutagenic response due to a decrease in the total number of revertants seen even though enough cells survive to produce a background lawn."

Mechanistic observations have been related to relative skin sensitization potential, as determined using the local lymph node assay (LLNA) as a biological read-out. The work presented here suggests that there is a common hapten involved in cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic alcohol sensitization and that metabolic activation (to cinnamaldehyde) is involved in the latter. Conversely, there does not appear to be a common hapten for cinnamaldehyde and alpha-amyl cinnamaldehyde..."

In mice, CA administration (250, 500 mg/kg orally and 50, 100 mg/kg ip) markedly prolonged hemorrhage and coagulation times and effectively reduced the mortality rate of collagen-epinephrine-induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism. In an arteriovenous shunt thrombosis rat model, the CA administration (250, 500 mg/kg orally and 50, 100 mg/kg ip) for 10 days dose-dependently decreased thrombus weight. Administration of CA also significantly inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in the rat platelet-rich plasma (PRP) ..."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Chinese hamster B241 cells were treated with ... 10 nM trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA) and surviving cells were cultivated for generations until the cells acquired the characteristics of transformed cells based on in vitro criteria: increase in (a) saturation density in monolayer culture, (b) plating efficiency at low serum level and (c) colony forming efficiency (CFE) in soft agar medium. When the values of CFE of the treated cells had become significantly high, anchorage-independent colonies were isolated, propagated and then subjected to an assay for neoplastic transformation. The anchorage-independent clonal cells (CH-AI-AG+-1 and CH-CA-AG+-2) were subcutaneously injected into a suprascapular site in nude mice. The mice were maintained in an SPF animal care facility and observed for tumor formation. Growth of neoplasm at the injection sites was observed in 6 out of 7 mice ... injected with CA ... transformed cells, ... during 3 to 8 months after the injection, as compared with 1 out of 6 mice injected with untreated control cells. Subsequent transplantation of the tumor cells into new mice induced tumor production at the injection site in all the animals within a considerably shorter period of time than that following the initial inoculation. Malignancy of the neoplastic cells was ascertained by histological examination, and the cells were found to have karyotypes of the hamster cells after in vitro cultivation of the tumor cells. These experimental results suggest the transforming potency of the flavoring agents in Chinese hamster cells. /trans-Cinnamaldehyde/"
