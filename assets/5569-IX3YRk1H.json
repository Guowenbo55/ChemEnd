            "Value": "AEROBIC: Trifluralin biodegrades faster in anaerobic soils than in aerobic soils(1). Trifluralin degraded with half-lives of 189, 202, and 116 days in sandy loam, clay loam, and loam soils, respectively, when incubated aerobically in the dark at 22 \u00b0C for 364 days(2). Seven degradates of trifluralin have been identified: alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-2,6,-dinitro-N-propyl-p-toluidine; alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-5-nitro-4-propyl-toluene-3,4-diamine; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-1-propyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzimidazole-3-oxide; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-1-propyl-5-(trifluoromethyl) benzimidazole; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzimidazole; alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-p-cresol; 2,2'-azoybis(alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-6-nitro-N-propyl-p-toluidine(2). These degradates were identified in test samples at maximum concentrations (% applied radioactivity) of 2.8-4.6%, 1.5-2.1%, 0.1-0.3%, 0.5-1.0%, 2.1-2.6%, 0.1-2.7%, and 0.8-3.0%, respectively(2). During the testing period of about one year, trifluralin parent declined to less than 25% of applied radioactivity in all soils(2). At the same time volatile and unextractable residues increased to 22% and about 45% of applied radioactivity(2). In another laboratory study, the estimated half-life for the biodegradation of 1,000 ppm trifluralin in soil was 405 days under aerobic conditions(3). Trifluralin, which was added to soil obtained from a pesticide disposal site, did not biodegrade in 157 days under aerobic conditions(4). Aerobic biodegradation of trifluralin proceeds through an initial dealkylation followed by reduction of the nitro groups(5). The trifluoromethyl group of trifluralin appears to remain intact in all major metabolites and is eventually oxidized to the carboxylic acid(6). In a 14-day environmental chamber study with a 14 hr photoperiod, degradation of 10 ppm trifluralin, present as a mixture with metolachlor and atrazine, was shown to occur in non-vegetated soil (47% degradation) but not to the extent of the Kochia scoparia rhizosphere soil (70% degradation), suggesting that the rhizosphere of certain plant species may facilitate microbial degradation(7). Incubation of radio-labled trifluralin with sediment samples under aerobic conditions resulted in a concentration reduction equal to 25% its original value after 10 days; the microbial community was not found to adapt to trifluralin(8). Trifluralin at an initial concentration of 100 ug/L underwent 49% removal when incubated with primary sewage effluent under aerobic conditions(9)."

Additionally, decreases (not statistically significant) in body weight gain (5.4 g treated vs 15.6 g control) and food utilization (2.6 treated vs 6.3 controls) were observed. The treated animals urinated orange-yellow fluid, indicative of the test compound and/or metabolites, resulting in soiled genital areas. During urinalysis, the following observations were made: (i) urine clarity was reduced in the treated animals on days 6 and 13; (ii) triple phosphate crystals were observed in all treated animals and were particularly abundant on days 6 and 13 (vs 3/5 control rats); (iii) amorphous material was found in the urine of treated animals; (iv) LDH and AST were increased at days 6 and 13; on day 13 the increase was 84% for LDH and 205% for AST; (v) mildly increased protein concentrations were observed on days 6 and 13.

Measurements of numerous parameters were made during urine chemistry and protein electrophoresis of the urine. No treatment-related adverse effects were observed on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, or body weight gain through month 3; after 4 months of treatment, there was a significant decrease in body weight, body weight gain and food utilization at >= 3200 ppm. Urine was discolored by the dinitroaniline compound at 3200 and 6400 ppm. No effect was observed in the 50 ppm group. Recovery was evident following 6 weeks of maintenance on the control diet in all groups, but was incomplete in the 6400 ppm group. There was a dose related increase (>= 200 ppm) in the incidence of intra-cytoplasmic hyaline droplet formation in the renal cortical tubular epithelial cells (minimal to moderate severity) and an increase in urine alpha1-globulin and alpha2-globulin (all biochemical indicators of kidney toxicity). In the >=800 ppm groups, significant increases of 73-489% in urinary total protein, AST, and LDH and in the urinary volume (38-89%) were observed.

No compound-related effects on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic examinations, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights, or gross or histopathological parameters were observed in either sex. At 1000 mg/kg, all animals showed signs of dermal irritation, characterized by moderate to severe erythema and slight to moderate edema accompanied by coriaceous, cracked, and bleeding skin beginning at 6-12 days after initiation of treatment and persisting until the end of the study with desquamation being observed within 11-20 days after initiation of treatment. At 1000 mg/kg, increased incidences of the following gross and histopathological lesions of the treated skin were observed: (i) thickened treatment area; (ii) minimal to slight acanthosis; (iii) slight hyperkeratosis; and (iv) minimal to slight inflammation of the dermis. Additionally, minimal to slight hyperplasia of the bone marrow was noted (2 males and 4 females vs 0 controls). These findings were considered secondary to the dermal irritation observed, rather than primary compound related effects. The systemic LOAEL was not observed. The systemic NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg/day. The dermal LOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day (limit dose) based on erythema, edema, and desquamation of the treated skin. The dermal NOAEL was not established."

Ten rats/sex/dose were sacrificed after 30 days, and the remaining 5 rats/sex/dose were sacrificed after a 14-day recovery period. There were no adverse effects of treatment on mortality, body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, food conversion ratio, water consumption, ophthalmology, or gross pathology. At 1000 mg/cu m, all rats showed slight dyspnea and ruffled fur; these symptoms were seen daily just after exposure starting with day 1 and were not observed on non-exposure days (i.e. weekends) or during the recovery period. In the females at this dose, increases in methemoglobin (1.59% treated vs 0.79% acetone control) and total bilirubin (62%) were observed at the end of the main study but were comparable to controls at the end of the recovery period. Direct bilirubin was increased in females; however, data were not provided. Treatment-related effects on the liver were observed; however, these changes were limited to increased liver weights and centrilobular hypertrophy and were considered adaptive. At the end of the main study, absolute and relative (to body) liver weights were dose-dependently increased 9-32% in the 300 and 1000 mg/cu m animals. Relative (to brain) liver weights were dose-dependently increased 10-14% in the 100 and 300 mg/m3 females and 21-28% in the 1000 mg/cu m animals. Incidence of minimal to slight centrilobular hypertrophy, characterized by increased homogeneity and reduced basophilia of the cytoplasm in enlarged hepatocytes, was dose-dependently increased in the >=100 mg/cu m males (4-10/10 treated vs 0/10 each control group) and in the 1000 mg/cu m females (7/10 treated vs 0/10 each control group). At the end of the recovery period, liver weights (absolute, relative to body, and relative to brain) remained dose-dependently increased (19-26%; ) in males at >=100 mg/cu m. The LOAEL for this study is 1000 mg/cu m (270 mg/kg/day) based on increased methemoglobin and bilirubin in females and incidences of dyspnea and ruffled fur in males and females.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ In a 6-month oral toxicity study, Trifluralin (96.1% a.i.) was administered to 6 Hoe: BEAK strain (Hoechst breed) beagle dogs/sex/group in the diet at dose levels of 0, 400, 1000, or 2500 ppm (equivalent to 0, 10, 25, and 63 mg/kg/day; based on 1 ppm = 0.025 mg/kg) for six months. Four dogs/sex/dose were sacrificed at the end of the 6-month treatment period, and the remaining 2 dogs/sex/dose were sacrificed after a 1-month recovery period in which they were given control diets. There were no treatment-related effects on urinalyses or histopathology. At 2500 ppm, one female and one male were sacrificed in extremis on days 39 and 85, respectively, due to marked reduction in food consumption, cachexia (general ill health due to rejection of food), and/or mild neurologic impairment. Overall body weight gains were decreased in males and females by 0.5 kg compared to increases of 1.0 kg in female and 1.6 kg in male controls. Food consumption was decreased 4-35% for individual males and females compared to controls. Corneal vascularization was dose-dependently increased at the end of the main study, occurring in 3/12, 5/12, and 7/12 dogs in the 400, 1000, and 2500 ppm groups, respectively, vs 0/12 controls. Corneal necrosis and ulceration were observed in control (7/12 dogs), 400 ppm (7/12 dogs), 1000 ppm (8/12 dogs) and 2500 ppm (9/10 dogs) groups. These lesions were still present at the end of the recovery period. In the early part of the study, these lesions were thought to be due to introduction of sand from the dog run area into the animals eyes. However, the dose relationship indicates an effect of treatment, either direct or indirect (e.g. behavioral alterations increased the likelihood of getting sand in their eyes). In another chronic dog study, no treatment-related effects on ophthalmology were observed at doses up to 750 ppm. Dose-dependent decreases (7-29%) were observed in hemoglobin, erythrocytes, and hematocrit in the 400 ppm males and 1000 and 2500 ppm animals at week 8 and in the 2500 ppm animals (12-26%) at 6 months. At 6 months, leukocytes were increased 31-41% in the 1000 and 2500 ppm females. Platelets were increased at 400 ppm and higher in males (42-51%) and 2500 ppm females at week 8 (62%) and in the 2500 ppm animals at 6 months (82-98%). Alkaline phosphatase was increased in females at 400 ppm at 3 months (99%), at 1000 ppm at 2, 5, and 6 months (84-146%), and at 2500 ppm throughout the study (121-241%). Absolute and relative to body liver weights were dose-dependently increased 22-81% in males and females dosed at 400 ppm and higher. At the schedule 6 month sacrifice, the following macroscopic findings were noted (vs 0 controls): (i) liver enlargement in all treated animals; (ii) discolored kidneys in all treated animals (except for one 2500 ppm male); (iii) small testes and prostate at 1000 (2/4) and 2500 (2/3) ppm; (iv) black gravelly contents in the gall bladder in the 2500 ppm males (2/3) and females (1/3); and (v) discolored (yellowish) fatty tissues in the 1000 (1/4) and 2500 (3/3) ppm females; this discoloration is characteristic of dinitroaniline treatment and not considered to be treatment related. The LOAEL for this study is 400 ppm (10 mg/kg/day) based on increased absolute and relative (to body) liver weights, liver enlargement, discolored kidneys, and corneal necrosis and ulceration in males and females; decreased red cell indices and increased platelets in males; and increased alkaline phosphatase in females. The NOAEL was not observed."

The P animals were given test article diet formulations for 70 days prior to mating to produce the F1a litters. After weaning, 25 rats/sex/dose from the F1a litters were given the same concentration test formulation as their dam for 69 days prior to mating to produce the F2a litters. A gross necropsy was performed on one pup/sex/litter from the weanlings not selected as parents. At 25 weeks of age, a second mating of the P animals was conducted to produce the F1b litters, and a second mating of the F1a animals was conducted to produce the F2b litters. After weaning, F1b and F2b animals were sacrificed and given a gross necropsy. Parental animals were sacrificed at 36 weeks and given a gross necropsy. There were no effects of treatment on parental mortality, mating/fertility indices, number of females with live-born progeny, gestation length, gestation survival, live-born litter size, sex ratio, or pup survival. At 630 ppm, body weights and food consumption were decreased in the F1 parental males at the end of pre-mating (6% each). Body weights were decreased in the P females during gestation from the F1b mating (7-9%). At 2000 ppm, body weights and food consumption were decreased 6-13% during (14-20%, males; 7-20%, females) and at the end (14%, males;11%, females) of pre-mating in the P and F1 parents. Body weights were also decreased 10% in the F1 females at the beginning of pre-mating. Body weight gains for the overall pre-mating period were decreased 9-23% in both generations. Food efficiency was decreased 14% during pre-mating in the P generation females. During the reproduction period, body weights were decreased 6-10% in the males in both generations. During gestation, body weights of the parental females were decreased 8-18% for both matings in both generations. During lactation, food consumption was comparable to controls, and body weight gains were dose-dependently increased in the P generation (both litters) and F1 generation (F2a litter). These increases attained significance at 2000 ppm (-5.6 to 5.9 g treated vs -25.6 to -11 g controls). Pale yellow adipose tissue was observed at necropsy in this group. This discoloration ... is characteristic of dinitroaniline treatment. Microscopic examination revealed normal tissue. The LOAEL for parental toxicity is 630 ppm (47 mg/kg/day) based on decreased body weights and food consumption. The NOAEL is 200 ppm (15 mg/kg/day). The LOAEL for reproductive toxicity was not observed. The NOAEL is 2000 ppm (148 mg/kg/day). Pup weights were decreased 6-12% in both generations at 2000 ppm starting at post-natal day 4. In the combined F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b litters, small pups (approximately half the size of litter mates) were noted in the 630 (3 litters), and 2000 (4 litters) ppm groups compared to concurrent controls (0 litters). Additionally, a slight increase in microphthalmia was observed at 2000 ppm (4 pups treated vs 1 control); however, three of these pups were from the same litter. Yellow adipose tissue was observed in the 2000 ppm pups. Again, this discoloration ... is characteristic of dinitroaniline treatment. The only finding at 200 ppm was small pups in one litter out of all combined F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b litters. The LOAEL for offspring toxicity is 630 ppm (47 mg/kg/day) based on small pup size in 3 litters. The NOAEL is 200 ppm (15 mg/kg/day)."

Lactation index was decreased (not significant) in these animals (62% treated vs 75% controls). The number of implantation sites was decreased in the F1a (9%) and F2 (18%) litters, resulting in a decreased number of newborn pups (17-22%) and significantly reduced litter size on post-natal days (PND) 1 and 4 (17-25%). Litter size remained decreased (3-14%) throughout the remainder of lactation in both generations. Pre-implantation loss was increased (15.5% treated vs 9.8% controls; ) in the F1b litters (mating of treated males with untreated females), resulting in a decreased (11%; ) number of live fetuses. At 4000 ppm pup weights were decreased throughout lactation in the F1a litters (average 15%) and on PND 14 and 21 in the F1a litters (74-81%). There were no offspring effects at 50 or 450 ppm. The LOAEL for reproductive toxicity is 4000 ppm (equivalent to 295/337 mg/kg/day, M/F) based on decreased ovarian weights in both generations; decreased lactation index in the F1a pups; and decreased number of implantation sites, newborn pups, litter size, and pup weights in both generations.

The results show that duplication time, amount of cellular protein and cell protein/DNA values were normal. Histological, haematological and chemical parameters were measured in CF1 mice after oral trifluralin administration. Acute toxic effects were assayed by administration of 50 or 200 mg/kg body weight daily for 30 days, and chronic effects by administration of 200 mg/kg body weight once a week for 90 days (n = 20). In the acute scheme treatment, hepatic (glutamic-pyruvic, glutamic-oxalacetic and alkaline phosphatase activities; proteins and albumin plasma concentrations) and pancreatic (amylase, glycaemia) functions were normal. Mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin and haematocrit decreased. Creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic-oxalacetic activity increased, suggesting lesion in myocardial tissue. Histology was normal, excepting for the heart (mild myocarditis). Similar results were observed in acutely treated animals. There were no differences in body weight gain for treated mice compared to controls. In view of the published therapeutic effects of trifluralin on CF1 Chagas disease model and considering the present results, trifluralin seems to be a moderately toxic drug with a potential selective effect on the myocardium."

A group of 15 male Fischer 344 rats were exposed to trifluralin-fortified (6500 ppm) diet for 2 weeks. The time weighted average daily intake of trifluralin was 441+/-77 mg/kg/day. Ten rats of the group were sacrificed and the sera analyzed for T3, T4, and TSH levels. The livers were also analyzed for selected T4-specific UGT gene expression and total UGT enzyme activity. In the trifluralin treated rats, the serum T3 and T4 levels decreased by 17% and 90%, respectively and TSH increased by 37% more than the control rats. Trifluralin-induced total hepatic UGT enzymes (2.4-fold) and mRNA expression of selected hepatic UGT isozymes (UGT1A1, 1.4-fold; UGT1A6, 6.4-fold; UGT2B1, 3.7-fold). For the remaining 5 rats in the group, bile was collected for 2 h and analyzed for free and conjugated T3 and T4. The total amount of T4 in bile more than doubled in trifluralin treated rats. Trifluralin treatment increased bile flow, caused a 3.2-fold increase in biliary elimination of conjugated T4 and 63% increase in conjugated T3. Based on these data, the decrease in total serum T3 and T4 levels in the trifluralin treated rats was due to enhanced peripheral metabolism and an increase in bile flow that results in a compensatory increase in TSH synthesis and secretion. The increased levels of TSH with chronic exposure to trifluralin would exert a continuous stimulation of the thyroid gland leading to cellular hypertrophy and proliferation predisposing to the development of follicular cell tumors in rats."

According to a classification scheme(8), this range of Koc values suggests trifluralin is expected to be moderately mobile to immobile in soil. An experimental adsorption coefficient of 30,550 was determined for trifluralin using Georgia pond sediment(9). Trifluralin was immobile in soil TLC experiments using 14 different soils that ranged from sandy loam to silty clay(10). In a laboratory screening study, trifluralin did not leach past 30 cm in 100 days(11-12). It was estimated that it would take 1580 yrs for trifluralin to leach through soil to a depth of 3 meters(12)."
