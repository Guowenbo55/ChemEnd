Stearamine /has/ been formulated for use as antistatic agents, although no current uses have been reported. Alterations including weight loss, increased mortality, and intestinal and mesenteric lymph node histiocyte accumulation have been reported in a study following treatment of experimental animals with 3,000 ppm stearamine, but these effects were not seen after exposure to 500 ppm. Chronic stearamine exposure has not been reported to induce tumor formation, although 0.01% stearamine in the presence of a high fat diet promoted the carcinogenic effects of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, while 0.1% inhibited tumor production. This compound was also reported to induce severe hyperplasia in the skin of albino-mice concentrations as low as 3 mg. ..."
