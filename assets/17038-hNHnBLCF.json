    "Description": "Captafol is a dicarboximide that captan in which the trichloromethyl group is replaced by a 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethyl group. A broad-spectrum fungicide used to control diseases in fruit and potatoes, it is no longer approved for use in the European Community. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of isoindoles, an organochlorine compound, an organosulfur compound and a phthalimide fungicide.",

The overall half-life of difolatan in soil is about 11 days, independent of soil type or initial concn(2). In soil, difolatan may be initially inhibitive to certain bacterial and microbial populations, but may be stimulative to certain bacterial populations(3,4). The inhibitory effect disappears in 7 days at a treatment level of 10 ppm(4). The rate of biodegradation was slowest in soil containing the highest organic carbon content(1,5)."

Significant increases were also observed in organ weight and organ to body weight ratios for kidney and adrenals of rats fed at 1,500 and 5,000 ppm. Histopathology revealed liver changes characterized by degeneration of hepatic cells, vacuolization, incipient fat alteration, and infiltration by mononuclear cells. Kidney changes were characterized by alterations in proximal and distal tubular cells, many giant forms with large, irregular nuclei being present. These changes in liver and kidney were seen only in rats fed the two highest dose levels. No other histopathological changes were associated with the administration of captafol.

            "Value": "The study investigated the effects of different fungicides on the fungus Entomophthora aphidis, which is known to infect pea aphids. The researchers tested three systemic fungicides (benomyl, ethirimol, and tridemorph) and seven non-systemic fungicides (captafol, captan, fentin acetate with maneb, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, and zineb) at concentrations commonly used in field applications.The results showed that all the tested fungicides inhibited the germination of E. aphidis conidia (asexual spores) and also suppressed the mycelial growth of the fungus in vitro. Among them, benomyl, fentin acetate with maneb, maneb, and thiram were found to be particularly effective, as they killed the fungus outright. Additionally, the study examined the impact of these fungicides on the infectivity of E. aphidis for pea aphids. Aphicidal effects were observed with benomyl, tridemorph, and thiram. Several non-systemic fungicides, with the exception of captafol and zineb, reduced the fungus's infectivity when the aphids were topically treated with the fungicides 6 hours before being exposed to the fungus. The suppressive effects persisted even when the aphids were inoculated with the fungus 48 hours after fungicide treatment. Interestingly, when aphids were inoculated with the fungus before fungicide treatment, most of the non-systemic fungicides (except zineb) still decreased the fungus's infectivity, regardless of whether the fungicides were applied 22 or 70 hours after inoculation. However, fungicides like captafol, zineb, and maneb showed reduced effectiveness in reducing the fungus's infectivity. Lastly, the researchers noticed variations in the number of conidia released from infected aphids treated with the fungicides. Benomyl and tridemorph decreased conidia production, while captafol and captan increased it. In summary, the study demonstrated that certain systemic and non-systemic fungicides have varying effects on Entomophthora aphidis, with some showing aphicidal activity and others suppressing the fungus's infectivity. The timing of fungicide application in relation to aphid inoculation and the type of fungicide used played a crucial role in determining their effectiveness."
