The first-order rate constant in river water ranged from approximately 0.0073 per hour at 14 \u00b0C to 0.0091 per hour at 25 \u00b0C(1); this corresponds to a half-life of about 4 days at 14 \u00b0C and 3.2 days at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). The first-order rate constant in bottom sediment ranged from approximately 0.0043 per hour at 14 \u00b0C to 0.0055 per hour at 25 \u00b0C(1); this corresponds to a half-life of about 6.7 days at 14 \u00b0C and 5.3 days at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). The half-life of tri-p-cresyl phosphate in Lake Ontario water, following a lag period of 2 days, was 2 days(2). In a laboratory model sewage treatment system 70 to 80% of methyl C-14 tri-p-cresyl phosphate added at 1 ug/ml was degraded in 24 hours using an activated sludge seed; the major metabolite was identified as p-hydroxybenzoic acid(3). In biodegradation tests using an activated sludge seed, tri-p-cresyl phosphate was observed to be biodegradable(4)."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc for tri-p-cresyl phosphate can be estimated to be 4.4X10+4(SRC). According to a recommended classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that tri-p-cresyl phosphate is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). Tri-p-cresyl phosphate was found to adsorb strongly to clay minerals in sorption tests(3). Using bottom sediment from a river, tri-p-cresyl phosphate was found to adsorb strongly to the sediment with a Freundlich isotherm constant of 138(4); it was further observed that tri-p-cresyl phosphate in the water column adsorbed to sediment and precipitated to the bottom(4)."
