            "content": "Based on the original material of 14C2-labeled Ba14CO3, 14C2-labeled 1,2,4-triazole was synthesized through a 4-step reaction process. The radioactive strength, specific activity, radiochemical purity, and radiochemical yield were 5.8131 mCi, 15.5347 \u03bcCi/mg, more than 99%, and 84.21%, respectively. Following methods reported for synthesizing myclobutanil, 14C2-labeled myclobutanil was produced from 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile through substitution and condensation. Its radioactive strength, specific activity, radiochemical purity, and radiochemical yield were 0.5566 mCi, 2.53 \u03bcCi/mg, more than 96%, and 85.4%, respectively. The uptake, translocation, and distribution of 14C2-myclobutanil in wheat seedlings at the 2-3 leaf stage were studied using radioactive tracing experiments. The results showed that radioactivity in the treated wheat roots decreased from 59.88% to 24.87%, while the accumulation of radioactivity in the stem base and leaves increased from 14.18% and 1.19% to 19.47% and 33.75%, respectively, after dipping the roots into 14C2-myclobutanil solution for 6-120 hours. 14C2-myclobutanil was readily absorbed and translocated upwards to the top of wheat seedlings. The distribution and accumulation of 14C2-myclobutanil in wheat leaves were positively correlated with the treatment time of root dipping, showing a steady increase in radioactivity from 2.94 \u00d7 10-6 \u03bcCi at 6 hours to 322.72 \u00d7 10-6 \u03bcCi at 120 hours. Autoradiograph experiments indicated that 14C2-myclobutanil could be absorbed and distributed throughout the whole seedling at 120 hours after treating the roots.",

After treatment, the plants were washed with water, 75% ethanol, and distilled water, and then oven-dried at 50\u00b0C for 72 hours for further analysis. This experiment used wheat seedlings as the test material, with 14C-azoxystrobin applied via root soaking. Different treatment time points were set, with sufficient replicates at each time point, to study the absorption and translocation behavior of 14C-azoxystrobin in wheat seedlings."
