When applied to the roots, it was readily absorbed and rapidly translocated to the shoots and leaves. However, when the roots were transferred to a propaphos-free solution, the radiocarbon was released into the culture solution, with the released compounds consisting of propaphos and propaphos SO in nearly equal amounts. Metabolic reactions included oxidation of the methylthio sulfur to sulfoxide and sulfone, hydrolysis of the phosphorus-0-phenyl ester, and identification of four metabolites. The recovery of radiocarbon from 4 and a half month old rice plants and soil treated with 14C-propaphos at 3g/are was estimated to be 3.7% in roots, 20% in shoots and leaves, 0.14% in hulls, 0.07% in hulled rice, and 58.2% in soil. The radioactive residue in hulled rice treated with 14C-propaphos was 0.02 ppm, which is below the residue limit of 0.05 ppm, and no intact propaphos was detected in it.",
