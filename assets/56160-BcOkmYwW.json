    "Description": "Chlorimuron-ethyl is an ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of chlorimuron with ethanol. A proherbicide for chloimuron, it is used as herbicide for the control of broad-leaved weeds in peanuts, soya beans, and other crops. It has a role as a proherbicide, an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor and an agrochemical. It is a sulfamoylbenzoate, a N-sulfonylurea, an aromatic ether, an ethyl ester, an organochlorine pesticide and a member of pyrimidines. It is functionally related to a chlorimuron. It is a conjugate acid of a chlorimuron-ethyl(1-).",

Twenty-day-old seedlings of all plant species were exposed to root-applied 14C-labeled chlorimuron for 6, 24, and 72 h. After 24 and 72 h, chlorimuron uptake was lowest in W-20 soybean and the two morningglory species. Translocation of root-absorbed chlorimuron to shoots and leaves of all species was limited and it did not differ among species. The moderate tolerance of pitted and entireleaf morningglories to chlorimuron may be due to reduced herbicide uptake. The response of Essex and Vance soybean to chlorimuron was related to herbicide metabolism. At 6 h after treatment with radiolabeled chlorimuron, Essex soybean metabolized the herbicide more rapidly than either W-20 or Vance soybean. At 24 h and 72 h, Essex and Vance soybean metabolized chlorimuron to the same extent. W-20 was not very efficient in metabolizing chlorimuron at any time after treatment and its resistance to chlorimuron is due to an altered target site.",
