    "Description": "Topramezone is an aromatic ketone that is phenyl 1H-pyrazol-4-yl ketone in which the pyrazolyl group is substituted at positions 1 and 5 by methyl and hydroxy groups, respectively, and in which the phenyl group is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 4 by methyl, 4,5-dihydro-1,2-oxazol-3-yl, and methylsulfonyl groups, respectively. A potent inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) that is rapily metabolised by corn to non-active substances, it is used as a herbicide for the treatment of broadleaf weeds. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a sulfone, a member of isoxazoles, an aromatic ketone and a pyrazolone.",

            "content": "Goosegrass [Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn.] remains problematic for bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] turf managers due to the ineffective, selective control of mature plants with available postemergence herbicides and lack of sufficient residual activity from those herbicides to control seedling plants. Topramezone controls mature E. indica, but past efforts to suppress potential injury to bermudagrass turf have been inconsistent. We hypothesized that metribuzin at 210 g ai ha\u22121 in admixture with topramezone would improve bermudagrass tolerance while conserving mature E. indica control. In preliminary field studies, metribuzin mixed with topramezone at 1.2 or 2.5 g ae ha\u22121 applied twice at a 3-wk interval reduced bermudagrass injury and white discoloration compared with topramezone applied alone, but metribuzin did not safen bermudagrass to mesotrione. Topramezone at 3.7 g ha\u22121 plus 210 g ha\u22121 metribuzin applied twice at a 3-wk interval offered improved bermudagrass tolerance while it still controlled mature E. indica during 15 field and 2 greenhouse studies in Virginia. This program offered a 10-fold decrease in suprathreshold duration of white discoloration compared with topramezone alone at 6.1 g ha\u22121. Bermudagrass absorbed three times less radioactivity than E. indica at timings up to 48 h after treatment with [14C]topramezone. Bermudagrass also metabolized twice as much topramezone compared with E. indica at 48 h after treatment. Metribuzin reduced 14C absorption by approximately 25% in both species. These studies confirm the performance of a novel, low-dose topramezone plus metribuzin program for mature E. indica control in bermudagrass turf and suggest that selectivity between bermudagrass and E. indica to topramezone is due to differential absorption and metabolism. The fact that metribuzin reduces topramezone absorption in both species suggests that it may help reduce bermudagrass phytotoxic response to topramezone, but its role in altering selectivity between bermudagrass and E. indica may be due to other factors.",

Greenhouse and laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effects of MSO on efficacy, solution property, droplet spread and evaporation, active ingredient deposition, foliar absorption and translocation of topramezone applied to giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.) and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.). Experimental results showed that 0.3% MSO enhanced the efficacy of topramezone by 1.5-fold on giant foxtail and by 1.0-fold on velvetleaf. When this herbicide was mixed with MSO, its solution surface tension and leaf contact angle decreased significantly, its spread areas on weed leaf surfaces increased significantly, its wetting time was shortened on giant foxtail but not changed on velvetleaf, and less of its active ingredient crystal was observed on the treated weed leaf surfaces. MSO increased the absorption of topramezone by 68.9% for giant foxtail and by 45.9% for velvetleaf 24 hours after treatment. It also apparently promoted the translocation of this herbicide in these two weeds.",
