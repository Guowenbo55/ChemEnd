An experimentally-determined production rate for coralline algae (Corallinaceae) collected from the Sea of Japan is 83 ng/hour/g of algae (wet weight)(2). Bromoform is produced in polar brown, green, and red macroalgae at rates of 150, 32, and 45 picomole/g/day wet weight and in subtropic green and red macroalgae at rate of 102 picomole/g/day wet weight(3). Laboratory and in-situ measurements of bromoform production by giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) collected from the southern California coastal region ranged from 25-1,126 (median = 171) ng/day/g of fresh weight and 136-304 (median = 256) ng/day/g of fresh weight, respectively(6)."

The experiments were conducted in continuous flow columns intended to simulate groundwater environments(1-2). The columns were seeded with mixed cultures of bacteria; acetate was used as the primary substrate(1-2). Approximately 20% of the initial concentration of 57 ug/L underwent biodegradation after 6.25 hours; approximately 30% biodegraded after 25 hours(1). Greater than 99% of the initial concentration of 18 ug/L was removed under methanogenic, denitrification and sulfate reducing conditions after 2.5 days(2). Greater than 99% reduction of bromoform, initially present at 132-177 ug/L was observed after 1.5 hours in a continuous flow column that was seeded with primary settled sewage; the above removal rate was attained approximately 1 year after operation of the column began(3). Anaerobic rate constants for bromoform were measured at 0.00096-0.0062/day in stream water(4). Under denitrifying conditions, a 60 ug/L solution of bromoform degraded to 59, 37, 35, and 2 ug/L after 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively(5)."

            "Value": "The GABA(A) receptor is an important target for a variety of general anesthetics, including halogenated ethers such as isoflurane and halogenated ethers such as chloroform. Bromoform is a halogenated alkane that exhibits anesthetic properties and has been shown by X-ray crystallography to bind to model anesthetic targets. In this study we report the ability of bromoform to potentiate GABA-induced current in recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) subunits. Recent studies have shown that specific point mutations in the transmembrane (TM) region of the GABA(A) receptor alpha-subunit can selectively abolish the modulatory activity of specific general anesthetics, and that molecular volume is a key determinant of anesthetic activity. The action of bromoform was examined in a series of mutant receptors and compared with the activity profiles of three other volatile anesthetics. The pharmacological profile of bromoform at the mutant receptors used in this study was similar to that seen with halothane, and distinct from that observed for isoflurane and chloroform. The molecular volume of bromoform is closest to that of halothane, and therefore our data are consistent with the idea that molecular volume is an important determinant of inhaled anesthetic activity at the GABA(A) receptor."
