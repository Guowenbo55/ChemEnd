Members of the genera Beggiatoa, Thioploca, and Thiotrix function in transition zones between aerobic and anaerobic conditions where both molecular oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are found. /Also/ some photosynthetic bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. Members of the families Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae (purple sulfur bacteria) are obligate aerobes and are phototropic, and are found in waters with high H2S concentrations. The interactions of these organisms form part of the global sulfur cycle."

            "Value": "Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is mainly known for its toxicity but has recently been shown to be produced endogenously in mammalian tissues and to be associated with physiological regulatory functions. To better understand the role of biomembranes in modulating its biological distribution and effects; we measured the partition coefficient of H(2)S in models of biological membranes. The partition coefficients were found to be 2.1+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.5 and 2.0+/-0.6 in n-octanol, hexane and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine liposome membranes relative to water, respectively (25 \u00b0C). This two-fold higher concentration of H(2)S in the membrane translates into a rapid membrane permeability, P(m)=3 cm/s. We used a mathematical model in three dimensions to gain insight into the diffusion of total sulfide in tissues. This model shows that the sphere of action of sulfide produced by a single cell expands to involve more than 200 neighboring cells, and that the resistance imposed by lipid membranes has a significant effect on the diffusional spread of sulfide at pH 7.4, increasing local concentrations. These results support the role of hydrogen sulfide as a paracrine signaling molecule and reveal advantageous pharmacokinetic properties for its therapeutic applications."

NaHS caused neuronal death, as assessed by LDH release and trypan blue staining, but did not significantly reduce the glutamate toxicity. The neurotoxicity of NaHS was resistant to inhibitors of NMDA receptors, T-type calcium channels and NOS, and was blocked by inhibitors of MEK, but not JNK, p38 MAP kinase, PKC and Src. NaHS caused prompt phosphorylation of ERK and upregulation of Bad, followed by translocation of Bax to mitochondria and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, leading to the nuclear condensation/fragmentation. These effects of NaHS were suppressed by the MEK inhibitor. Data suggest that the NMDA receptor-independent neurotoxicity of H(2)S involves activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and some apoptotic mechanisms."

Numerous studies have demonstrated that exposure to formaldehyde (FA) causes neuronal damage and that oxidative stress is one of the most critical effects of FA exposure. Accumulation of FA is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of present study is to explore the inhibitory effects of H(2)S on FA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms underlying in PC12 cells. /Researchers/ show that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H(2)S donor, protects PC12 cells against FA-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis and that NaHS preserves the function of mitochondria by preventing FA-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c in PC12 cells. Furthermore, NaHS blocks FA-exerted accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, and up-regulation of Bax expression. These results indicate that H(2)S protects neuronal cells against neurotoxicity of FA by preserving mitochondrial function through attenuation of ROS accumulation, up-regulation of Bcl-2 level, and down-regulation of Bax expression. Study suggests a promising future of H(2)S-based preventions and therapies for neuronal damage after FA exposure."
