            "Value": "AEROBIC: Chloroacetic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 65.0% of its theoretical BOD in 3 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(1). The test was repeated under the assumption that the test substance inhibited the sludge because only 1 replicate of 2 showed biodegradation tendency(1). After 4 weeks, 2 out of 5 replicates had degraded more than 90%, while the remaining 3 replicates had degraded more than 60%(1). CO2 evolution was 14-24% and 73% of the theoretical amount possible at a chloroacetic acid concentration of 4.5 and 9.0 mg carbon/L, respectively, after a 7-day incubation with an activated sludge inoculum(2). Chloroacetic acid was completely degraded in the Closed Bottle test (at 5 mg/L), the Modified OECD Screening Test (at 5 mg C/L), and the Zahn-Wellens Test (at 1000 mg/L)(3). Chloroacetic acid was degraded in laboratory biodegradation tests using sewage or acclimated sludge inocula with greater than 70-90% degradation being reported in 5-10 days(4-7,9). Degradation was increased by acclimation(7,9) and involves dechlorination(7). Mineralization occurred in river water with 73% of the chemical being converted to carbon dioxide in 8-10 days at 29 \u00b0C(8). The biodegradability of chloroacetic acid, at 10 ppm, was measured in both river water and seawater using the cultivation method; no biodegradation was reported for either samples after a 3-day incubation(10). Based on these results, this compound was determined to be difficult to degrade(10)."

Therefore, harmful local and systemic effects were investigated after dermal exposure to MCA. A 0.5 mL aliquot of MCA solution (40% w/w) was applied to the abdominal skin of ten 10-week-old male SD rats under anesthesia. The exposure area (25 x 25 sq mm) was 1.6% of the total surface area. The dose of MCA per area was 34.1 mg/sq cm. Saline was similarly administered to 10 control rats. Histopathological findings after 10 min were observed by light microscopy. Blood samples were collected by exsanguinations from the carotid arteries after 4 hr. Skin samples were collected 10 min after the initial exposure. Histological findings showed severe degeneration of collagen bundles in the epidermis and subcutaneous tissues. P(CO2), HCO(3)-, TCO2, base excess (BE) and glucose levels were decreased in the MCA group. AST, m-AST, ALT, BUN, Cr, NH3, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, RBC, Hb, Hct, total protein and albumin were increased in the MCA group. The burn was determined to be a third-degree burn on the basis of the histopathological findings. The severe toxicity was probably a consequence of the rapid permeability. Biochemical parameters were a consequence of hepatocellular injuries, renal dysfunction, dysglyconeogenesis and dysfunction of ammonia metabolism. MCA reportedly enters the TCA cycle and inhibits aconitase. MCA metabolites also inhibit pyruvate carboxylase in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Therefore, the important serum biochemical abnormalities such as hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis should be monitored to find the acute systemic disorders."

Mice exhibiting front paw rigidity were killed at various times after MCA treatment and their brains were prepared for histological examination. As early as 48 hr post-treatment, RBCs were found outside capillaries in several brain regions, especially the cerebellum. At time points up to 8 weeks after MCA, extracapillary RBCs were seen to be undergoing lysis, and there was loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Three hours after oral administration of an LD80 of MCA (380 mg/kg), entry of iv-injected (14C)inulin or (3H)dopamine (1.0 uCi) into all brain regions was significantly increased compared to controls. Increased entry of (14C)inulin into the brains of mice occurred as early as 2 hr after MCA, coinciding with the onset of signs of toxicity, and remained elevated for up to 8 hr following treatment. Further studies revealed that only those mice which were moribund but not those which were unaffected by MCA (380 mg/kg) 4-6 hr after treatment had significantly increased brain levels of (14C)inulin or (3H)dopamine. However, mice which survived an LD80 of MCA and exhibited front paw rigidity 24 hr later also had brain radiotracer concentrations significantly greater than controls. Both the lethal effects of MCA and the physical deficits observed in survivors may be associated with impairment of blood-brain barrier function."

BA was more cytotoxic (31x) and genotoxic (14x) than MX in CHO cells. BA was over 400x more genotoxic than potassium bromate. The brominated haloacetic acids (HAAs) were more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs. The HAAs expressed a statistically significant inverse relationship in CHO cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as a function of increased numbers of halogen atoms per molecule. A quantitative comparison was conducted with results from a previous study with cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in S. typhimurium. There was no correlation between chronic CHO cell and bacterial cell cytotoxicity. DBP-induced CHO cell cytotoxicity was not related to mutagenic potency in S. typhimurium. Cytotoxicity in CHO cells was statistically significant and highly correlated to CHO cell genotoxicity. Finally, /it was/ determined that the DBP genotoxic potency in CHO cells and the mutagenic potency in S. typhimurium were not related. This suggests that toxicity data in S. typhimurium did not quantitatively predict the toxic effects of DBPs in mammalian cell systems ..."

We propose a model of toxic action based on monoHAA-mediated inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a target cytosolic enzyme. This model predicts that GAPDH inhibition by the monoHAAs will lead to a severe reduction of cellular ATP levels and repress the generation of pyruvate. A loss of pyruvate will lead to mitochondrial stress and genomic DNA damage. We found a concentration-dependent reduction of ATP in Chinese hamster ovary cells after monoHAA treatment. ATP reduction per pmol monoHAA followed the pattern of iodoacetic acid (IAA)> bromoacetic acid (BAA) >> chloroacetic acid (CAA), which is the pattern of potency observed with many toxicological endpoints. Exogenous supplementation with pyruvate enhanced ATP levels and attenuated monoHAA-induced genomic DNA damage as measured with single cell gel electrophoresis. These data were highly correlated with the SN 2 alkylating potentials of the monoHAAs and with the induction of toxicity.

However, haloacetic acids (HAAs), generated as byproducts of water disinfection, are cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic. Previous studies of monoHAA-induced genotoxicity and cell stress demonstrated that the toxicity was due to inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), leading to disruption of cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. DiHAAs and triHAAs are also produced during water disinfection, and whether they share mechanisms of action with monoHAAs is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mono-, di-, and tri-HAAs on cellular GAPDH enzyme kinetics, cellular ATP levels, and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity. Here, treatments conducted in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed differences among mono-, di-, and triHAAs in their molecular targets. The monoHAAs, iodoacetic acid and bromoacetic acid, were the strongest inhibitors of GAPDH and greatly reduced cellular ATP levels. Chloroacetic acid, diHAAs, and triHAAs were weaker inhibitors of GAPDH and some increased the levels of cellular ATP. HAAs also affected PDC activity, with most HAAs activating PDC. The primary finding of this work is that mono- versus multi-HAAs address different molecular targets, and the results are generally consistent with a model in which monoHAAs activate the PDC through GAPDH inhibition-mediated disruption in cellular metabolites, including altering ATP-to-ADP and NADH-to-NAD ratios. The monoHAA-mediated reduction in cellular metabolites results in accelerated PDC activity by way of metabolite-ratio-dependent PDC regulation. DiHAAs and triHAAs are weaker inhibitors of GAPDH, but many also increase cellular ATP levels, and we suggest that they increase PDC activity by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase."

CA has been reported to be highly corrosive and to induce severe tissue injuries (including nervous system) that lead to death in mammals. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of CA-induced neurotoxicity remain unknown. In the present study, we found that CA (0.5-2.0 mM) significantly increased LDH release, decreased the number of viable cells (cytotoxicity) and induced apoptotic events (including: increases in the numbers of apoptotic cells, the membrane externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), and caspase-3/-7 activity) in Neuro-2a cells. CA (1.5 mM; the approximate to LD50) also triggered ER stress, which was identified by monitoring several key molecules that are involved in the unfolded protein responses (including the increase in the expressions of p-PERK, p-IRE-1, p-eIF2alpha, ATF-4, ATF-6, CHOP, XBP-1, GRP 78, GRP 94, and caspase-12) and calpain activity. Transfection of GRP 78- and GRP 94-specific si-RNA effectively abrogated CA-induced cytotoxicity, caspase-3/-7 and caspase-12 activity, and GRP 78 and GRP 94 expression in Neuro-2a cells. Additionally, pretreatment with 2.5 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a glutathione (GSH) precursor) dramatically suppressed the increase in lipid peroxidation, cytotoxicity, apoptotic events, calpain and caspase-12 activity, and ER stress-related molecules in CA-exposed cells.

However, there is little known about neurotoxic injuries of CA on the mammalian, the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of CA-induced neuronal cell injury are mostly unknown. In this study, we examined the cytotoxicity of CA on cultured Neuro-2a cells and investigated the possible mechanisms of CA-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment of Neuro-2a cells with CA significantly reduced the number of viable cells (in a dose-dependent manner with a range from 0.1 to 3mM), increased the generation of ROS, and reduced the intracellular levels of glutathione depletion. CA also increased the number of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells; increased mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of MMP, cytochrome c release, and accompanied by Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 down-regulation and Bax up-regulation), and activated the caspase cascades activations, which displayed features of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. These CA-induced apoptosis-related signals were markedly prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, CA activated the JNK and p38-MAPK pathways, but did not that ERK1/2 pathway, in treated Neuro-2a cells. Pretreatment with NAC and specific p38-MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), but not JNK inhibitor (SP600125) effectively abrogated the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and attenuated the apoptotic signals (including: decrease in cytotoxicity, caspase-3/-7 activation, the cytosolic cytochrome c release, and the reversed alteration of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA) in CA-treated Neuro-2a cells.

DCAA (100 mg/kg, ip) administered to rats 15 minutes after a LD80 of MCAA (80 mg/kg, iv) consistently reduced the mortality to 0%, while PB reduced the mortality to less than 20%. Both DCAA and PB were found to be similarly effective to mice. The hypothesis that PB reduces mortality in MCAA treated rats by altering the metabolic disposition of MCAA was evaluated and rejected. ... The relationship between altered blood-brain barrier permeability and death in MCAA treated rats /was also investigated/. Treatment with MCAA (80 mg/kg, iv) was associated with a significant (50%) increase in the permeability of the rat blood-brain barrier to (125)I-BSA /(bovine serum albumin)/. The effect was not altered by treatment with PB, however, suggesting that the altered blood-brain barrier permeability does not have an important role in the lethal effect of MCAA in rats. ... The effect of MCAA on brain carbohydrate metabolism /was studied/ in vivo. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood lactic acid concentrations increased in MCAA treated rats, and the increase in CSF levels was dose related. In individual MCAA treated rats, CSF lactate concentrations paralleled the time course of ataxia and a discrete threshold for death (18 mmol/L) was observed. ... Hypoxia increased brain lactate and mortality in MCAA treated rats. Both PB and DCAA which decreased mortality in MCAA treated rats, decreased brain lactate levels in MCAA treated rats. ... /It was/ concluded that PB and DCAA are effective antidotes to MCAA intoxication in rats and mice, and that the lethal effect of MCAA in rats is essentially associated with an excessive accumulation of lactic acid in CSF. It is suggested that the effect of MCAA on the blood-brain barrier function and death are distinct, however this is in contrast with the results of an acute toxicity study in mice ... /which/ concluded that the damage of the blood-brain barrier of mice is associated with both neurological dysfunction and death."

            "Value": "The Koc of chloroacetic acid is estimated as 2(SRC), using a log Kow of 0.22(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that chloroacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of chloroacetic acid is 2.87(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely  in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
