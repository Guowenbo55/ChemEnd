            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ The toxicity of acetoin in rats was investigated and compared to ethyl-alcohol. Small (unspecified) amounts of a 30% acetoin solution or ethyl-alcohol were injected ip into rats until the loss of the righting reflex or until respiratory failure. In another series, 5 mg/kg methyl-alcohol was injected, followed by acetoin until respiratory failure was induced. Blood was drawn and analyzed for the compounds. With loss of righting reflex, acetoin ranged from 227 to 251 mg percent with an average of 235 mg. Ethyl-alcohol ranged from 288 to 312 mg with an average of 300 mg. Acetoin intoxication resembled ethyl-alcohol intoxication. Upon respiratory failure, acetoin concentrations ranged from 742 to 770 mg percent with an average of 754 mg. Ethyl-alcohol ranged from 900 to 952 mg percent with an average of 920 mg. With combined administration, the concentrations of acetoin and ethyl-alcohol in the blood were additive in effect. The author concludes that acetoin is 1.4 times more intoxicating than ethyl-alcohol."

Rats were starved before and after administration of chemicals. OC was measured between 1 and 6 hours after treatment using a diaferometer or a digital respirometer. ...In-vitro OC of rat diaphragma and liver slices was measured in a Warburg apparatus using Krebs phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. ...Acetoine at 3600 mg/kg had no influence on OC. ...No decrease in blood pressure was observed. Injection of 3600 mg/kg of acetoine made them comatose for several hours. Liver slices and diaphragms from normal or uremic rats showed a normal metabolic rate. Exposure to compounds at 30 mg/dL had no influence on tissue respiration. Addition of 400 mg/dL of urea and 20 mg/dL of creatinine had no influence on OC when given alone or in combination with chemicals."

No animals died during the study, and their condition and appearance were normal. The body weights of males at 12,000 mg/kg in drinking-water decreased significantly from week 5, and at weeks 2, 6, and 13 the relative weight of the liver was statistically significantly greater in these animals than in controls. A similar effect was seen in female rats, but only after 13 weeks. Hematological examination conducted at 13 weeks showed a small (4-8%) but statistically significant (p<0.05) decrease in hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte counts in animals of each sex at the high dose, but these changes were not accompanied by a decrease in hematocrit. Urinalysis and blood chemical determinations performed at the end of the study on all animals revealed no statistically significant differences between treated and control groups. Histopathological examination also revealed no adverse effects. ...The increased relative liver weights /may have been/ a reaction of the liver to an increased metabolic load resulting from the high intake of acetoin. The NOEL was 3000 ppm, equivalent to 330 mg/kg bw/day."
