UV spectra of the products identified them as 3-alkylthymidines, and this was confirmed by IR and NMR spectra.

            "Value": "Reproductive parameters in Fischer 344 rats were evaluated following inhalation of propylene oxide for two successive generations. Thirty male and 30 female rats were exposed to 0, 30, 100, or 300 ppm propylene oxide for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 14 weeks and then mated to produce the f1 litters. After weaning, 30 randomly selected f1 pups/sex/group were exposed to propylene oxide for 17 weeks and subsequently mated to produce the f2 litters. Reproductive parameters examined included fertility, litter size neonatal growth, and survival. All adults and selected weanlings were examined for gross and histologic lesions. Toxicity due to propylene oxide was demonstrated by decreased body weights of parental f0 and f1 rats at 300 ppm. No treatment-related effects on fertility (mating or conception) were observed in either f0 or f1 matings. Neonatal surival indices for f1 or f2 litters revealed no treatment-related effects. Litter size was decreased in the f1 rats exposed to 100 ppm propylene oxide. However, the litter size in the 300 ppm group was comparable to the control group, and no effect on litter size was shown in propylene oxide exposed f2 litters. Pup weights were unaffected by parental exposure to propylene oxide in either generation. Pathologic examination of adults and weanlings revealed no changes considered due to propylene oxide. Based on these results, it is concluded that inhalation exposure to propylene oxide at levels up to 300 ppm over two generations did not produce any adverse effects on reproductive function."

            "Value": "The developmental toxicity potential of propylene oxide was evaluated in Fischer 344 rats following inhalation exposure. Four groups of 25 mated female rats were exposed to 0, 100, 300, and 500 ppm of propylene oxide for 6 hr per day on Gestation Days 6 through 15, inclusive. Cesarean sections were performed on all females on Gestation Day 20 and the fetuses removed for morphological evaluation. Exposure to propylene oxide did not adversely affect survival, appearance, or behavior at any of the exposure levels tested. Maternal body weight gain and food consumption were reduced significantly among the females at the 500 ppm level during the exposure period. No exposure-related effects were noted with respect to maternal water consumption, organ weights, cesarean section, or fetal morphological observations with the sole excretion of increased frequency of seventh cervical ribs in fetuses at the maternally toxic exposure level of 500 ppm. In summation, the no-observable-adverse-effect level of propylene oxide, when administered to Fischer 344 rats via whole-body inhalation exposure, was considered to be 300 ppm."

Rat dominant lethal and mouse sperm-head morphology assays were conducted using males exposed to propylene oxide at 300 ppm in a dynamic exposure chamber for 7 hr/day on 5 consecutive days. A sex linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila melanogaster employed a 24 hr static exposure to propylene oxide at 645 ppm. Male mice were killed 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 wk post exposure for evaluation of sperm-head morphology. Propylene oxide exposure did not result in an increase in abnormal forms. Male rats were mated with 2 virgin females/wk for 6 wk following exposure. A statistically significant increase in preimplantation losses and a statistically significant reduction in the number of living implants in the 1st post exposure wk did not appear to be treatment related. A highly significant increase in sex linked recessive lethal mutations was observed in 2 germ cell stages (mature sperm and developing spermatocytes). These results warrant continued caution in potential human exposure to propylene oxide."

These studies evaluated the acute inhalation toxicity of respirable aerosols of three ethylene oxide/propylene oxide compounds (U-660, U-2000, and U-5100) that differ in chain length, molecular weight, and viscosity. The respective 4 hr LC50 values (95% confidence limits) for U-660, U-2000, and U-5100 in Wistar albino rats were 4670 (4090-5320), 330 (227-480), and 106 (45-245) mg/cu m. Occasionally, slight increase in respiration rate and slight hyperactivity were observed during the postexposure period. All deaths were delayed for 2-5 days postexposure. Body weight gains were transiently depresed in rats exposed to U-2000 and U-5100. Discolored lungs and livers occurred in animals which died during the 14 day postexposure period. Subsequently, a repeated-exposure study was conducted on U-5100 in F-344 rats exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 9 exposures at mean concentrations of 0, alveolar epithelial cells. Lung weights remained elevated after the 2 wk at concentrations as low as 5 mg/cu m."

Four chemicals, propylene, 1,2-propylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, and vinylidene chloride, were tested for their mutagenic potential. Cultures were exposed to the chemicals, which were delivered as vapors or gases, for 4 hr, then cultured for 2 days before plating in soft agar with or without trifluorothymidine, 3 ug/ml. Each chemical was tested at least twice. Significant responses were obtained with 1,2-propylene oxide and vinylidene chloride, but neither cytotoxicity nor mutagenicity was induced by 1,3-butadiene; propylene could not be classified as either mutagenic or non-mutagenic in the assay. Rat liver S9 mix was not a requirement for the mutagenic activity of 1,2-propylene oxide, whereas the liver preparation markedly enhanced both the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of vinylidene chloride."

Increased incidences of degenerative and hyperplastic changes of the nasal mucosa were observed in all exposed groups. Exposure to 300 ppm propylene oxide was associated with an increased incidence of both benign and malignant mammary tumors in females. There was no increase in the incidence of any particular type of tumor other than mammary tumors. The total number of rats bearing malignant tumors at sites other than the mamamry glands was increased in both sexes in the 300 ppm group compared with the controls."

Propylene oxide reacts as an SN2 alkylating agent by forming the following 2-hydroxypropyl adducts: N6-2-hydroxypropyl-dAdo (7% yield), 7-2-hydroxypropyl-Gua (37%) and 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dThd (4%). Alkylation at N-3 of dCvd resulted in conversion of the adjacent exocylic imino group at C-4 to an oxygen (hydrolytic deamination) with the formation of a dUrd adduct, 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dUrd (14%). Ultraviolet spectroscopy and mass spectrometry were used for the structural determination of these adducts. Confirmation of the unexpected 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dUrd adduct was provided by an accurate mass measurement technique where diagnostic ions in the mass spectra of 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dUrd were measured to within 0.0005 atomic mass units of the predicted mass. Propylene oxide was reacted in vitro with calf thymus DNA (pH 7.0-7.5, 37 \u00b0C, 10 hr) and yielded N6-2-hydroxypropyl-dAdo (1 nmol/mg DNA), 3-2-hydroxypropyl-Ade (14 nmol/mg DNA), 7-2-hydroxypropyl-Gua (133 nmol/mg DNA) and 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dUrd (13 nmol/mg DNA). A mechanism for the hydrolytic deamination of 3-2-hydroxpropyl-dCyd to 3-2-hydroxypropyl-dUrd involving the hydroxide on the 2-hydroxypropyl side chain is proposed. This cytosine to uracil conversion may play a role in the mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of this epoxide."
