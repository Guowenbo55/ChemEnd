In sandy loam soil, the first and second aerobic soil half-lives were 40 days and 139 days(3). The half-life of vernolate (5 ppm) was 2-3 weeks both in Regina heavy clay (pH 7.5, 4.0% organic content) and Weyburn loam (pH 7.0, 6.5% organic content) at 25 \u00b0C with water added to field capacity(4). Vernolate (1280 ppm) was 60% detoxified in 8 weeks at the optimal soil pH of 7.6 as determined by cucumber bioassays(5). Repeated vernolate use on a plot of soil resulted in enhanced degradation where adapted organisms degrade the pesticide faster(6)."

After ip injection of EPTC, molinate, butylate, vernolate, pebulate, diallate, triallate, liver extracts contained the S-methyl derivatives of the respective parents. Additionally, when the dosing was conducted with the glutathione (GSH) conjugate of molinate, the liver extract contained methyl molinate ester. Thus, methylation appears to be a way to reactivate molecules such as the GSH-conjugates of thiocarbamates. The methylated thiocarbamate can be released again into circulation as a molecule that can undergo additional reactions such as sulfoxidation."

NOEL=5 mg/kg/day: the only indications of treatment effects extending down to the LEL of 20 mg/kg/day were slight increases in extent of hemosiderin deposition and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. At 100 mg/kg/day, there were several findings consistent with anemia and associated enhanced turnover of RBCs: findings included statistically significant decreases in hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and RBC counts in both sexes; also consistently elevated platelet counts in males; enhanced degree of the above spleen effects; brown pigment accumulation in liver reticuloendothelial cells and in kidney tubular epithelium; and hypercellular sternal bone marrow. Also, the high dose led to reduced body weights in both sexes (statistically significant in females only), and to significantly elevated liver weights in both sexes, as well as significantly increased spleen and kidney weights in females. Occasional axonal degeneration in cervical and lumbar spinal cord in both sexes was observed in 100 mg/kg/day males and females. Thus there was found a sharp increase in response between 20 and 100 mg/kg/day."

An LEL of 100 ppm is based on the statistically significant depression in the mean body weight for both parental males and females. The NOEL for reproductive effects is considered to be 500 ppm, since no effects on mating, fertility, gestational or lactational indices were observed. Urinary tract variants were observed at a varied rate in offsprings; whether this effect is compound-related or due to normal variation is not clear without evaluating historical data on this condition."
