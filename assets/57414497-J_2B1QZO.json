Through hydroponic treatment, it was observed that triflumezopyrim could efficiently be absorbed by the rice roots and transported upward to the upper leaves. However, in the foliar treatment, while triflumezopyrim was detected in the lower leaves, it was not found in the roots in the short term. This suggests high acropetal translocation within the rice plant, showing a systemic movement of the insecticide. The systemicity of pesticides is influenced by their physical and chemical properties, affecting their movement within the plant. Triflumezopyrim's concentration was mainly concentrated on the treated leaves, indicating a localized effect. This research offers insights into the systemic behavior of triflumezopyrim within rice plants, highlighting its absorption, distribution, and movement within different plant parts, which could guide its application strategies for effective pest management and environmental safety considerations. Further efforts to enhance its systemic conductivity through formulation processing might be considered for practical applications.",
