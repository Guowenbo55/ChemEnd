While the ring test results were generally rather heterogenous, one of the compounds studied, 4-nitrophenol, turned out to be particularly problematic as the compound was found either easily biodegradable or not biodegradable by various laboratories in various tests. This paper describes some more detailed studies on 4-nitrophenol degradation in two different tests, the modified Organization for Economic Cooperation screening test (MOST test) and the Zahn-Wellens test, respectively. The test variable investigated include inoculum characteristics and pretreatment, test duration, and 4-nitrophenol concentration. The results are discussed in relation to toxicity and degradation pathways of 4-nitrophenol."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: A study was conducted of possible reasons for acclimation of microbial communities to the mineralization of organic compounds in lake water and sewage. The acclimation period for the mineralization of 2 ng of p-nitrophenol (PNP) per mL of sewage was eliminated when the sewage was incubated for 9 days, with no added substrate. The acclimation period for the mineralization of 2 ng but not 200 ng or 2 ug of p-nitrophenol/ml was eliminated when the compound was added to lake water that had been first incubated in the laboratory. Mineralization of p-nitrophenol by Flavobacterium sp was detected within 7 hr at concentrations of 20 ng/mL to 2 micrograms/mL but only after 25 hr at 2 ng/mL. p-Nitrophenol utilizing organisms began to multiply logarithmically after 1 day in lake water amended with 2 ug of p-nitrophenol/ml, but substrate disappearance was only detected at 8 days, at which time the numbers were approaching 10(5) cells per mL. The addition of inorganic nutrients reduced the length of the acclimation period from 6 to 3 days in sewage and from 6 days to 1 day in lake water. The prior degradation of natural organic materials in the sewage and lake water had no effect on the acclimation priod for the mineralization of p-nitrophenol, and naturally occurring inhibitors that might delay the mineralization were not present. The length of the acclimation phase for the mineralization of 2 ng of p-nitrophenol/mL was shortened when the protozoa in sewage were suppressed by eucaryotic inhibitors added to lake water."

            "Value": "AEROBIC 4-Nitrophenol is a benchmark chemical for biodegradability test and therefore there are numerous results on its behavior in screening tests. The results of the biodegradability screening studies are conflicting, ranging from no degradation to rapid degradation using soil, sewage, activated sludge, sediment, and freshwater inocula. The results are roughly divided between 4-nitrophenol biodegrading moderately slowly and rapidly; acclimation is generally important(1-12,14) while some of the conflicting results may be due to differences in concentrations of the test chemical, inocula, toxicity at higher concentrations(3), or insufficient acclimation. Many results were obtained in interlaboratory comparisons in which different laboratories report 0 and 100% degradation for the same test(1). The importance of acclimation is illustrated in results of 100% degradation in 15 and 3 days without and with acclimation, respectively; the latter also at much higher concentration levels(2). At very low concentration levels (parts per trillion range), mineralization is achieved without a lag period(12). 4-Nitrophenol biodegrades rapidly in simulated biological treatment plants, but only after adequate acclimation(2,4,5,13)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: As the concentration of 4-nitrophenol in Mardin silt loam soil was increased from 1 ppb to 50 ppm the lag period increased and time for 10% mineralization increased from 5 hr to 40 hr(1). When 2 ppm of 4-nitrophenol was incubated in agricultural topsoil at 10 \u00b0C, the half-life was 0.7-1.2 days under aerobic conditions(2). In subsoil the half-life was 40 days under aerobic conditions when the soil moisture was at 79% field capacity(2). The biodegradation of 4-nitrophenol in agricultural soil is greatly increased by pretreatment of the soil with 4-nitrophenol, and decreased by the presence of some fertilizers, fungicides, and herbicides(3). The experiments which showed this involved monitoring the rate of mineralization of ring-labeled parathion in which 4-nitrophenol is an intermediate(3). The addition of captafol, maneb, and benomyl reduced the mineralization after 3 wk from 6.4-41% of controls while PCNB had no effect(3). Pretreatment of the soil with 4-nitrophenol increased the amount mineralized after 1 day from 2 to 34%(3). Amending with 100 ppm-N ammonium sulfate and potassium nitrate reduced the 3-week mineralization 83 and 35%, respectively, although ammonium nitrate did not have a similar effect(3). 4.3% of the theoretical BOD was observed for 4-nitrophenol in sludge over a 2 week incubation period(4). A half-life of about 8 days was observed for 4-nitrophenol in a laboratory batch microcosm incubated with sediment and groundwater(5). 4-Nitrophenol was degraded over 80% in an aerobic groundwater/sediment microcosm from a landfill during a 60 day incubation period(6). First-order rate constants of 0.09/day to 0.5/day were determined for 4-nitrophenol in aerobic aquifer material(7), corresponding to half-lives of about 1-8 days(SRC). The biodegradation half-life of 4-nitrophenol in an acidic soil was reported as 2.5 days and the biodegradation half-life in a basic soil was reported as 10.2 days(8)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In die-away tests in which a chemical is added to a water sample from a site, 4-nitrophenol degrades rapidly with acclimation and half-lives decrease with increasing concn of 4-nitrophenol. Typical half-lives are: approximately 1.5 days in the Vistula River in Warsaw, Poland for 5-20 ppm of chemical(2), 7.6 days, mean value calculated in 5 ponds(8); 50% mineralization in 300 hr at 1 ppm increasing to 700 hr at 0.5 ppb including a 250 hr lag in a eutrophic lake(4); and 58% mineralization in 14 days in an oligotropic lake for 1 ppb of chemical(3). When 4-nitrophenol was incubated in freshwater/sediment eco-cores from 5 sites along the Escabia River in Florida, 10-63% mineralization occurred in 160 hr including a 40-120 hr lag(6). However, when the eco-cores were preexposed, there was no longer a lag and 12-58% mineralization occurred in 80 hr(6). Similarly in eco-cores from a freshwater pond, 4-nitrophenol disappeared within 80 hours in previously treated cores and within 15 hr when treated a third time(1). At the time of disappearance approximately 40-50% of the nitrophenol had mineralized(1). Mineralization was much slower in eco-cores from a salt marsh than from a river, 9-21% in 250 hr versus 46-49% in 100 hr in the freshwater system(7). The half-life was 348-1225 days in salt water from three sites in Pensacola Bay(5) although the half-lives were decreased to 9-291 days by the addition of sediment from the site into the test flasks and to 13-20 days in eco-cores from the same sites(5). When initially dosed, 4-nitrophenol disappeared slowly from a laboratory microcosm (100% disappearance in 7.5 days) and a test pond, however on redose 10 days after initial treatment, it disappeared within a day(1). Nine months after the study, the microbial community in the pond had apparently reverted as an acclimation period was again required before the 4-nitrophenol degraded(1). The biodegradation half-life of 4-nitrophenol was reported as 18 hours and 6.8 days in aerobic and anaerobic waters, respectively(9). Using a shake-flask die-away method, 4-nitrophenol degraded completely in about 60 days using a polluted coastal seawater inoculum while very little degradation occurred using unpolluted offshore seawater(10); increasing the total volume of the test media resulted in shorter lag periods(11). Using an Everglades soil from South Florida, 4-nitrophenol was found to mineralization considerably within a week at concentrations of 10 and 100 ug/g soil, but no mineralization occurred after 4 months of incubation at 10 mg/g(12). In a 5-day river die-away test using river water from the Songhua River in China, 4-nitrophenol had theoretical BOD of 50.3%(13). In batch river die-away tests using a river water from Denmark, it was found that pre-adapting the water to 4-nitrophenol reduced the biodegradation lag period from 10 days to less than one day(14)."

In the 18-day repeated dose newborn rat study, 4-nitrophenol was orally given from Day 4 to Day 21 after birth but did not induce any toxicity up to 160 mg/kg in the main study, although it induced death in one of six males at 160 mg/kg, and three of six males and one of six females at 230 mg/kg in a prior dose-finding study. In the 28-day repeated dose oral toxicity study starting at 6 weeks of age, 4-nitrophenol caused the death of most males and females at 1,000 mg/kg but was not toxic at 400 mg/kg except for male rat-specific renal toxicity. As unequivocally toxic levels were considered to be 230 mg/kg/day in newborn rats and 600 to 800 mg/kg/day in young rats, and NOAELs were 110 mg/kg/day in newborn rats and 400 mg/kg/day in young rats, the susceptibility of the newborn to 4-nitrophenol appears to be 2.5 to 4 times higher than that of young animals. In the newborn rat study of 2,4-dinitrophenol, animals died at 30 mg/kg in the dose-finding study and significant lowering of body and organ weights was observed at 20 mg/kg in the main study. In the 28-day young rat study, clear toxic signs followed by death occurred at 80 mg/kg but there was no definitive toxicity at 20 mg/kg. As unequivocally toxic levels and NOAELs were considered to be 30 and 10 mg/kg/day in newborn rats and 80 and 20 mg/kg/day in young rats, respectively, the toxicity of 2,4-dinitrophenol in newborns again seems to be 2 to 3 times stronger than in young rats. Abnormalities of external development and reflex ontogeny in the newborn were not observed with either chemical. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the toxic response in newborn rats is at most 4 times higher than that in young rats, at least in the cases of 4-nitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol."

Statistically significantly increased incidence of epidermal inflammation (marked to severe), hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis were observed in both sexes at 175 and 350 mg/kg and dermal necrosis was observed in 2-3 males. Based on mortality and dermal irritation, a LOEL of 175 mg/kg is identified for this study. The NOEL is 87.5 mg/kg.

Plasma concentrations of prolactin were significantly increased by 10 mg/kg 4-nitrophenol, and plasma concentrations of corticosterone were significantly increased in all treatment groups. These findings clearly show that 4-nitrophenol influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in immature male rats, with decreased secretion of LH and FSH and increased secretion of testosterone and inhibin. 4-Nitrophenol, therefore, appears to disrupt endocrine activity in the immature male reproductive system."

The Koc of 4-nitrophenol was reported as 55 in Brookston clay loam(2) and a log Koc of 1.7 was reported in a second study(3). The increasing content of copper in two Chinese soils was shown to limit 4-nitrophenol adsorption(4). In sorption studies using peat, 4-nitrophenol had measured Koc values of 96 (when 4-nitrophenol was in the neutral state) and 16 (when 4-nitrophenol existed as anionic species)(5). Using a reference soil from Germany, 4-nitrophenol had Koc value of 148 in a soil column leaching test(6). A Koc of 26 was measured in one sediment sample from China(7). A median literature Koc value of 234 (log Koc = 2.37) has been reported for 4-nitrophenol which can be used to develop QSAR estimations(8). According to a classification scheme(9), a median Koc value of 234 suggests that 4-nitrophenol is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, the experimental Koc range extends from 16 to over 500 suggesting a range of very high mobility to low mobility(SRC). The pKa of 4-nitropehnol is 7.15(10), indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(11)."
