            "Value": "Tetranitromethane treatment of 3-ketosteroid-Delta(1)-dehydrogenase of Rhodococcus rhodochrous caused loss of the catalytic activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Peptides (P-81) and (PN-83) were isolated from tryptic digests of the native and tetranitromethane-treated enzyme proteins, respectively. PN-83 was the nitrated form of P-81. The amino acid sequence was GGAPLIDYLESDDDLEFMVYPWPDYFGK (positions 97-124 of the dehydrogenase sequence). PN-83 showed a low yield of PTH-Tyr of position 116, i.e. less than 5% of that of P-81, and instead a high yield of PTH-3-nitrotyrosine. This indicated that tetranitromethane modifies Y-116 under the experimental conditions used. Mutation of Y-104, Y-116, and Y-121 to smaller amino acid residues, Phe, Ser, or Ala, significantly changed the catalytic activity of the dehydrogenase. All of the mutants contained FAD and exhibited the same spectrophotometric properties as those of the wild type enzyme. The K(m) values for 4-androstene-3,17-dione of the Y-104, Y-116, and Y-121 mutants changed to large values. The most drastic change was observed for Y116A. The K(d) values for 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione of the Y116 mutants changed to 1.5-2.6-fold larger values than that of the recombinant enzyme. The Y-121 mutant enzymes exhibited catalytic activities like those of the recombinant enzyme, but the catalytic efficiencies of Y121F and Y121A drastically decreased to 0. 014-0.054% of that of the recombinant enzyme. The present results indicate that Y-121 plays an important role in the catalytic function, and that Y-116 and Y-104 act on binding of the substrate steroid."

The rat lung neoplasms were classified as adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas (epidermoid carcinomas), or adenosquamous carcinomas. The mouse lung tumors were classified as papillary adenocarcinomas or adenomas. In both species, the tumors were morphologically similar to lung tumors in humans. The transfection assay using NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts detected transforming genes in 74% (14 of 19) of the rat lung tumors and in 100% (4 of 4) of the mouse lung tumors. Southern blot analysis indicated that transforming gene was an activated K-ras protooncogene in both species. The first exon of the K-ras gene in normal DNA and in DNA from two cell lines transformed by tumor DNA was compared by cloning and sequencing the gene. Experiments showed that there was a GC----AT transition in the second base of the 12th codon of the K-ras oncogene in the two transfectant DNAs. Oligonucleotide hybridization indicated that all of the rat and mouse transfectants had this activating lesion. Additional tumor DNA was then tested for the presence of a mutated allele with the GC----AT transition. All of the rat tumors tested and all of the mouse tumors tested had this mutation present. Hybridization using the normal oligonucleotide sequence around the 12th codon indicated that the normal allele was also present in the majority of the tumors, suggesting that the loss of normal allele is not necessary for the developing of neoplasia. One rat lung tumor had no normal allele present, possibly suggesting that this tumor could have been in a more advanced stage than the other tumors. This is the first study to detect activated protooncogenes in rodent tumors induced under conditions which mimic human exposure to chemical in the workplace. Tetranitromethane may exert its carcinogenic action by both activation of the K-ras oncogene and stimulation of cell proliferation by its irritant properties.[Stowers SJ et al; Cancer Res 47 (12): 3212-29 (1987)]"

The DNA-damaging potency of HZ was higher in rats than in humans, and the opposite was true for MOCA. In agreement with these findings, statistically significant increases in the average frequency of DNA breaks were obtained in the lung of rats given a single oral dose (1/2 LD50) of the six test compounds.
