            "Value": "AEROBIC: Results of screening tests on nitrobenzene are conflicting with results ranging from rapid degradation to no degradation. These results include: 100% degradation in 7 days with a sewage inoculum(1); 98% removal after 5 days with activated sludge(2); 99.6 and 20% degradation after 6 days using municipal and industrial sewage seeds, respectively(3); 100% degradation in 10 days, including a 6 day lag(4); 0.4% mineralization in 5 days(5); no BOD removed after 5 days using a sewage seed(6,7); degradation resistant according to results of the MITI test, the biodegradation test of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry(8); no degradation in 10 days with an activated sludge inoculum(9); degrades in >64 days using a soil inoculum(10); and 3.3% of the theoretical BOD reached in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(11). Nitrobenzene was degraded by activated sludge in municipal wastewater at concn of 400-600 g/cu m(12). Activated sludge adapted to degradation of high pyridine concn is also able to decompose nitrobenzene(12). While many factors affect biodegradation such as concn of the test compound, inoculum, acclimation of the seed, environmental factors, and incubation time, no simple explanation for these disparate results is apparent(SRC). Several investigators have reported, however, that nitrobenzene is toxic to microorganisms at higher concentrations(13,14). Resistance to biodegradation is reportedly due to its insolubility in water and the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring(15)."

Nitrobenzene showed no biodegradation in 48 days in sediment and surface water taken from Vajen (pH 5.0-5.2 and 2.2-2.9 mg/L of dissolved organic carbon) and Grindsted (pH 4.6-6.1 and 1.0-3.4 mg/L of dissolved organic carbon), Denmark incubated at 10 \u00b0C in the dark from a starting of 100 ug/L(2). Nitrobenzene was rapidly biodegraded after a lag phase of 70 to 85 days in an aerobic aquifer test done with groundwater and sediment from 8 locations over a 149 day incubation period(3). In situ studies done at Grindsted landfill, Denmark showed instantaneous anaerobic biodegradation of nitrobenzene 1 m from the injection well during the 8 month continuous injection flow study(4). Nitrobenzene has an estimated half-life of 0.3 to 3 days in ground water and rivers due to biodegradation(5). In a model aquatic ecosystem, little degradation occurred over the 2 day course of the experiment since most of the radioactivity was recovered as the parent compound(6)."

Small amounts of metHb are continually produced due to autoxidation of Hb during the normal respiratory function of loading and unloading of oxygen by erythrocytes. A variety of xenobiotics, including nitrobenzene and aromatic amines, can cause methemoglobinemia by accelerating the oxidation of Hb to metHb, which loses its ability to combine reversibly with oxygen"

Moreover, in vitro incubation of RBCs with nitrobenzene does not result in the formation of metHb. Taken together, these findings suggest that it is the presence and cycling of the reductive products of nitrobenzene within RBCs that cause the conversion of oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) to metHb. ... The primary metabolic event in the formation of metHb (Fe3+) from oxyHb (Fe2+) as a result of nitrobenzene exposure is the cycling between phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene."

In severe methemoglobinemia arising from extensive nitrobenzene poisoning, central nervous system effects may be predicted on the basis of hypoxia alone. It has also been hypothesized that these lesions might represent a hepatic encephalopathy secondary to the liver toxicity of nitrobenzene ... Other results suggest that it is possible that brain parenchymal damage may have resulted from anoxia or hypoxia due to vascular damage or decreased blood flow to affected areas ...  Another possible mechanism for the central nervous system damage is the formation of superoxide radicals or toxic hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide ... Evidence has been adduced to indicate that the ability of a related compound, dinitrobenzene, to cause cell death in in vitro co-cultures of rat brain astrocytes and brain capillary endothelial cells (a blood-brain barrier model) is at least partly due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the culture."

            "Value": "Exposure of rats to nitrobenzene produces a degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. Sperm production was continuously monitored in rats surgically prepared by anastomosing the vas deferentia with the urinary bladder to evaluate the reversibility of nitrobenzene toxicity. Rates of sperm production were monitored by collecting urine and counting sperm microscopically with hemocytometer. Six weeks after surgery, rats were dosed po with a single dose of 300 mg/kg of nitrobenzene in corn oil. Sperm were not detected in the urine of treated rats between 32 and 48 days after treatment. Despite the fact that degenerative changes in the siminiferous tubules were observed histologically as early as 3 days after dosing, there was a 32-day lag period between treatment and cessation of sperm output in treated rats. Histological examination showed that pachytene spermatocytes and step 1-2 spermatides were the most susceptible cell stages to nitrobenzene and were observed forming into giant cells as early as 3 days after treatment. However, repair was substantial by 3 weeks after treatment and by days 76-100, the rate of sperm output reached 78% of the control group. By 100 days after treatment, there was greater than 90% regeneration of the seminiferous epithelium. Thus, a single oral dose of nitrobenzene induced testicular degeneration and approximately a 17-day period of aspermia resulted. Back-dating of the aspermic period to the timing of the spermatogenic cycle closely corresponded with the same germ cell stages that were observed degenerating in histologic examinations. Thus, changes in sperm output from vasocystotomized rats correlated well with histopathologic changes, demonstrating the value of this technique for toxicity studies."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ The effect of dietary pectin on nitrobenzene induced methemoglobinemia were investigated. Male Fischer 344 rats were fed a purified diet containing 5 percent cellulose (diet 1), diet 1 with a 5 percent pectin replacing the cellulose (diet 2), or a cereal based diet containing 8.4 percent cellulose (diet 3) for 28 days. Rats were then administered 50 to 600 mg/kg nitrobenzene by mouth. Methemoglobin conc were determined from 1 to 24 hr later. The total number of anaerobic cecal bacteria was examined. In-vitro cecal metabolism of radiolabeled nitrobenzene was also measured, and metabolism products were examined using high pressure liquid chromatography. Administration of 50 to 150 mg/kg nitrobenzene did not result in significant methemoglobinemia in any group. Treatment with 200 mg/kg nitrobenzene produced 40 percent methemoglobinemia in rats fed diet 3 at 4 to 8 hr, compared with 30 percent for the diet 2 group, and 5 percent for the diet 1 group. Similar but dose dependent results occurred at 400 and 600 mg/kg. At 600 mg/kg nitrobenzene, the highest methemoglobin concentration, 64 percent, was seen in diet 3 animals. Those fed diet 1 had 20 percent methemoglobinemia, and those fed diet 2 had an intermediate methemoglobin concentration of 44 percent. The total number of viable cecal anaerobes was elevated 2 to 2.5 times in rats fed diets 2 or 3, compared with those fed diet 1. In-vitro, cecal metabolism of nitrobenzene was greatest in animals fed diet 3, least in those fed diet 1, and intermediate in those fed diet 2. Metabolites of nitrobenzene produced by cecal contents from animals fed diets 2 and 3 included aniline, nitrosobenzene, and azoxybenzene; only aniline was detected in animals fed diet 1. The authors conclude that nitrobenzene induced methemoglobinemia is significantly different in animals fed purified or cereal based diets. These diet related differences are probably related to dietary composition of fermentable carbohydrates and are mediated by dietary alterations in intestinal microflora."

Nine male and three female rats at the 150 mg/kg-day dose level died prior to study completion. The earliest deaths in the 150 mg/kg-day dose male and female rats were at day 67 (week 10) and day 38 (week 6), respectively. In the same group, six males also died on day 73 (week 11) and two more died on day 88 (week 13), while another female rat died on each of days 45 (week 7) and 60 (week 9). Clinical signs of toxicity, such as ataxia, head tilt, lethargy, and trembling, were evident, mostly in animals receiving 150 mg/kg-day and, to a lesser extent, 75 mg/kg-day. Overall, there was little change in body weight gain between control and treated groups, and the final body weights were not significantly different from controls at any dose level. In fact, the only sign of treatment-related body weight reduction was in the single surviving male rat receiving 150 mg/kg nitrobenzene. Organ weights appeared to have been dose dependently affected by nitrobenzene exposure, most notably in the case of liver, kidney, and testis (males). ...Liver weights and their ratios to body weight were dose dependently increased over control levels and achieved statistical significance compared with controls at all dose levels. Right kidney weight was increased over controls at all dose levels, and the ratio of kidney weight to final body weight was significantly increased over controls at the 9.38, 18.75, and 75 mg/kg-day dose levels. Right testis weight and its ratio to body weight were decreased in the 18.75-75 mg/kg dose range. There were statistically significant changes in some hematologic parameters in rats exposed to nitrobenzene via gavage. ... The principal effects were dose-dependent decreases in hematocrit (Hct), Hb, and RBC count and dose-dependent increases in reticulocyte counts and metHb. ... At necropsy, rats receiving 150 mg/kg-day nitrobenzene had enlarged spleens. Males at this dose level had enlarged livers, and those receiving 75 mg/kg-day and 150 mg/kg-day showed signs of testicular atrophy. ... Histopathologic examination of the major organs and tissues revealed compound-related effects in the spleen, which appeared to be congested. Splenic corpuscles were small, and the red pulp contained hemosiderin. The severity of splenic congestion was graded by the study authors. Control rats had no splenic congestion or minimal splenic congestion (grade 1). Congestion increased in severity up to moderate in the highest dose group. ... Hyaline droplets were noted in the cortical tubule cells of the kidney, and some pigmented granules were evident in the cells of a few treated rats. There were obvious compound-related histopathologic effects on the seminiferous tubules of the testis of male rats. In some cases, the tubules contained spermatogonia and spermatocytes, while in others there were very few or no spermatids, spermatozoa, and Sertoli cells. Some tubules appeared to contain only a lacy fibrinous material, and others contained multinucleate giant cells. Histopathologic changes in the brains of treated rats included hemorrhage, vacuolization, and a wide range of inconsistent degenerative changes. Based on the changes in absolute and relative organ weights and the dose-dependent increases in reticulocyte count and metHb concentration, all of which were evident at the lowest administered dose, a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 9.38 mg/kg-day is identified for the subchronic oral effects of nitrobenzene in F344 rats in this study."

Animals were evaluated for generalized signs of toxicity, and body weight changes and food consumption were monitored in all groups.

Clinical signs in high-dose rats included decreased movement, pale skin, and abnormal gait. Additionally, the authors plotted the body weight changes against time and showed a marked treatment-related reduction in body weight increase, even though food consumption was little changed among the groups. Striking changes in hematologic parameters were evident in nitrobenzene-treated rats, with dose-dependent reductions in RBC count, Hct, and Hb concentration and a dose-dependent increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV). By contrast, the WBC count increased dramatically with dose. However, these changes were not noted in those animals allowed to recover for 14 days after dosing.

Hematology parameters and serum BUN concentrations returned to control levels after a 14-day recovery period. ... Histopathologic evaluation of tissues was used to corroborate changes in tissue weight and clinical chemistry with severity of response (grade: no change < moderate < severe). In male rats, graded responses for splenic congestion, increased brown pigmentation in red pulp, and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis exhibited a dose-dependent increase in grade, with 100% of animals being scored as severe at the highest dose tested. Female rats exhibited a similar dose-dependent increase in severity of scores for the above indices, with 100% of animals being graded as severe for splenic congestion and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increased brown pigmentation in red pulp was graded as severe in two and moderate in three female rats. Liver scores were graded as no change in all groups, except for the high-dose animals in both sexes. In high-dose males and females, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was moderate in five males and two females and exhibited no change in one male and three females. Brown pigmentation in Kupffer cells was moderate in five males and four females and severe in one male and one female. Absolute kidney weights in males were inconsistent with the histopathologic finding. In the highest dose group, brown pigmentation in tubular epithelium was reported as moderate in five animals and severe in one animal, but no change in absolute kidney weight was reported at the highest dose. In contrast, female histopathology of the kidney correlated with the absolute weight in that 100% of animals were graded with moderate brown pigmentation in tubular epithelium at the highest dose, and a 3% increase in absolute kidney weight was also observed at the highest dose. All other animals were consistent with controls (no change). Decreased absolute testis weight correlated with severe degeneration of seminiferous tubular epithelium and severe atrophy of seminiferous tubule in 100% of male rats receiving 125 mg/kg nitrobenzene."

There were no compound-related effects on body weight, mortality, or the occurrence of behavioral signs in the subchronic 90-day study. However, increases in spleen weights were evident in all strains and sexes of rats and mice exposed to nitrobenzene at the high concentration and at 16 ppm in male F344 and CD rats. By contrast, there was a statistically significant reduction in testis weight in male F344 rats exposed to 50 ppm nitrobenzene. Examination of the internal organs of exposed animals at necropsy confirmed that the liver, spleen, and testis were the primary target organs of nitrobenzene. For example, in high-concentration rats of either strain, males presented with testicular atrophy, enlarged spleens, and the presence of irregular blotches on the surface of the liver. Similarly, both sexes of B6C3F1 mice had enlarged spleens in response to nitrobenzene at 50 ppm. ... Most marked among the potential compound-related changes in hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters were the increased concentrations of serum metHb and a 50% increase in the concentration of bilirubin in male F344 rats receiving 16 and 50 ppm nitrobenzene. Histologic sections of organs and tissues of nitrobenzene-receiving rats and mice demonstrated treatment-related lesions in the spleen, testis, liver, epididymides, kidney, and bone marrow, plus other possible target organs of nitrobenzene, such as the adrenals, lymph nodes, and lungs. For example, in F344 rats, lesions in the spleen consisted of acute sinusoidal congestion, proliferative capsular lesions, and increases in extramedullary hematopoiesis. These effects were dose dependent with 10/10 animals of either sex affected in F344 rats exposed to 50 ppm. Histopathologic effects of nitrobenzene on the liver in F344 rats included disorganization of the hepatic cord architecture and centrilobular degeneration of the hepatocytes in 7/10 high-concentration males but only in 1/10 high-concentration females. Other histopathologic effects evident in F344 rats included basophilia of the medullary cells of the adrenal in 5/10 high-concentration males and in 3/10 high-concentration females, plus an increased incidence of bronchial hyperplasia in both sexes receiving the highest dose. All male F344 rats displayed degeneration of tubular epithelial cells in the testis. The condition was described by the authors as representing a cessation of maturation at the level of primary and secondary spermatocytes and was usually accompanied by interstitial edema and hyperplasia of Leydig cells. There were no mature sperm in the epididymis of these F344 rats. Instead, the presence of some apparently proteinaceous material was noted in the ducts. Kidney effects of nitrobenzene in F344 rats were characterized by a toxic nephrosis associated with an accumulation of droplets in the cytoplasm of proximal tubular epithelial cells. The droplets were described in the report as hyaline and eosinophilic, and the lesions increased in incidence and severity with dose in both sexes of F344 rats. ..."

An increase in the thickness of the splenic capsule was noted in 4/10 male and 3/10 female CD rats exposed to 50 ppm nitrobenzene. CD rats also displayed a marked bilateral testicular atrophy in response to nitrobenzene, as indicated by a loss of seminiferous epithelium, interstitial cell hyperplasia, edema, and the absence of mature sperm in the epididymal lumen. These features were evident in 1/10 subjects receiving 5 ppm nitrobenzene, 2/10 receiving 16 ppm, and 9/10 receiving nitrobenzene at the highest concentration. Toxic effects of nitrobenzene were particularly apparent in the nasal passages of CD rats. These lesions were characterized by the occurrence of lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammation, and the presence of interstitial and granulomatous pneumonitis, together with the presence of macrophages and lymphocytes in perivascular areas. In a manner similar to F344 rats, CD rats displayed dose-dependent toxic nephrosis, with 10/10 male and 5/10 female rats exposed to 50 ppm nitrobenzene displaying this condition.

A number of noncarcinogenic responses to nitrobenzene were observed in the study. Both male and female F344 rats in the 25 ppm group displayed treatment-related statistically significant reductions in RBCs, Hct, and Hb concentration, with mean levels that were lower in animals sacrificed at term compared with animals sacrificed at 15 months. Concentrations of metHb increased with increasing nitrobenzene exposure, though time-related trends in this parameter were less clear-cut. Most notable among the hematologic responses in CD rats were the increases in metHb in the 15-month interim blood samples. ... These achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01) versus controls at all dose concentrations employed in the study. No histopathology was performed on the spleens of CD rats at interim or final sacrifice to determine if effects in the spleen accompanied the statistically significant increase in metHb levels. It should be noted, however, that, at final sacrifice, metHb levels were only increased in the 25 ppm exposure group, which may indicate a compensatory response to metHb formation. It should also be pointed out that background metHb levels in both strains of control rats were consistently higher at 24 months than at 15 months, resulting in apparently less pronounced relative changes at 24 months than at 15 months among exposed animals. Furthermore, metHb levels were much lower among control rats in the 90-day inhalation or gavage studies than among control rats at 15 or 24 months. Collectively, these findings may indicate a correlation between metHb and age of rats. ... In mice, RBCs and Hct were statistically significantly lower in 50 ppm males than in controls (8.70 + or - 0.12 versus 9.61 + or - 0.29 x 10+6 cells uL and 41.64 + or - 0.52 versus 45.06 + or - 1.15%, respectively). In common with the rats, there were statistically significant increases in metHb concentrations in high-dose mice of both sexes compared with controls. Numerous noncancerous histopathologic lesions resulted from nitrobenzene inhalation, though some of these responses were not clear-cut because of a high incidence of the same effect in controls, which left the possibility that the response might be a nonspecific lesion due to age. For example, chronic nephropathy and extramedullary hematopoiesis of the spleen occurred in controls and at all concentration levels in both sexes of F344 rats and in male Sprague-Dawley rats. However, a number of histopathologic effects of nitrobenzene appeared to be compound related, including those in the nose, spleen, liver, kidney, and testis. ... In mice, tissue sites displaying increased incidence of nonneoplastic lesions included lung, olfactory epithelium, and, in the males, thyroid follicular cells and hepatocytes. Histopathologic endpoints for the lung included hyperplasia and alveolar bronchiolization.11 In male mice, a clear exposure-dependent increase in hyperplasia was found, up to 20% in high-exposure animals versus 1.5% of controls. In contrast, female mice displayed a mixed response, with findings of hyperplasia in 3% of animals at 5 ppm, 8% at 25 ppm, and 2% at 50 ppm versus controls. Bronchiolization of the alveoli was increased at all exposure levels (male mice: 5 ppm, 87%; 25 ppm, 89%; and 50 ppm, 94%; female mice: 5 ppm, 92%; 25 ppm, 98%; and 50 ppm, 100%). This endpoint was not detected in any controls."

Hepatic centrilobular necrosis appeared inconsistently in rats given various doses of nitrobenzene, while hepatocellular nucleolar enlargement was consistently detected in rats given doses of nitrobenzene as low as 110 mg/kg. Lesions occurred in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles, with marked necrosis of primary and secondary spermatocytes following a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg.   Furthermore, within 3 days of nitrobenzene administration, multinucleated giant cells were observed, and decreased numbers of spermatozoa were observed in the epididymis. Histopathologic analyses indicated that nitrobenzene had no apparent effects on spermatogonia or the epididymal epithelium. In parallel to the observed histopathologic lesions in liver and testes, methemoglobinemia was increased to 25% immediately after dosing at 300 mg/kg, with a subsequent slow decline over the next 10 days. In a control experiment, the administration of sodium nitrite also induced methemoglobinemia but had no histopathologic effects on the testes and liver, suggesting that the histopathologic effects of nitrobenzene occurred through a direct action of the compound or its metabolites at the tissue site rather than as a secondary effect of metHb formation."

Large reductions in testicular (>50%) and epididymal weights, sperm count, and motility were observed in those animals exposed to nitrobenzene for 14 days, while sperm viability and the fertility index were severely reduced in those males exposed to nitrobenzene for 21 days or more. There was a concomitant increase in the incidence of abnormal sperm. While the copulation indices of treated males appeared unchanged with duration of exposure, the numbers of virgin females becoming pregnant by treated males declined markedly with duration of exposure. No mating females became pregnant in groups that were mated with males treated for 28 days or longer, an effect that appeared to result from the production of sperm with poor motility and reduced viability."

Because the observed mating period was no more than a single day for most mating pairs, the actual dosing duration for males and females was 40-41 days but could have lasted as long as 54 days for some. ... A wide range of histopathologic consequences of nitrobenzene treatment was observed, especially in animals receiving 60 and 100 mg/kg-day of the compound. These included atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, hyperplasia of Leydig cells, and loss of intraluminal sperm in the epididymides. Such histopathologic lesions as centrilobular swelling of hepatocytes, hemosiderin deposition in Kupffer cells, and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen were seen in all exposed groups. Neuronal necrosis/gliosis in the cerebellar medulla was evident in rats exposed to 60 and 100 mg/kg-day nitrobenzene. Among the reproductive/developmental parameters that were evaluated, there were no statistically significant differences from controls in the copulation and fertility indices at any dose level. However, among the dams, only two of nine pregnant females in the high-dose group survived to term, with the subsequent deaths of the two survivors (and their reduced litters) occurring on days 1 and 3 of lactation. In the remaining offspring, pup body weights were statistically significantly decreased at day 0 for both males and females by approximately 10% in the 60 mg/kg-day group. At day 4, body weights in male pups were statistically significantly decreased by about 5% in the 20 mg/kg-day group and by about 25% in both male and female pups in the 60 mg/kg-day group."

Testicular cell cultures were prepared from Alpk:Ap-rats. The exposure of Sertoli cells to nitrobenzene resulted in Sertoli cell vacuolation, the exfoliation of germ cells, and dose dependent increases in lactate and pyruvate secretion in the presence or absence of germ cells. Following exposure to concentrations greater than 0.0005 M nitrobenzene resulted in an increase in the in-vitro secretion of lactate and pyruvate by Sertoli cells in a dose dependent manner, both in the presence and absence of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and in the presence and absence of germ cells. Following exposure of cocultures or Sertoli cell cultures to nitrobenzene, basal inhibin secretion exhibited a reproducible alteration in response in a biphasic pattern and was taken by the authors as a confirmation of germ cell modulation of Sertoli cell inhibin secretion. The finding that these effects of nitrobenzene on inhibin secretion were not evident in follicle stimulating hormone stimulated cultures does not support the use of inhibin as a specific indicator of the toxic actions of nitrobenzene on the Sertoli cells. The authors state this to be the first study to evaluate the potential of inhibin secretion by Sertoli cells as a marker of toxicant action."

Mice were not markedly more susceptible to S. pneumoniae or P. berghei than corn oil controls. For S. pneumoniae, host resistance involves complement, B lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages; for P. berghei, it involves cytophilic antibody and antibodies that enhance the capability of macrophages to recognize free plasmodia. Mortality after the herpes simplex viral challenge was reduced in nitrobenzene-treated animals compared with vehicle controls, particularly at 100 mg/kg bw. The modest protection may have been attributable to enhanced macrophage or interferon activity, which was able to compensate for the depressed natural killer cell and T-lymphocyte function. At the two highest nitrobenzene doses, mice were more susceptible than vehicle controls to death as a result of L. monocytogenes infection, especially at the 100 mg/kg bw dose. Resistance to this infection is mediated primarily by T lymphocytes, macrophages, and complement activity. In terms of the percentage of animals with tumors, nitrobenzene treatment did not markedly affect host resistance to B16F10 melanoma, a resistance that involves T lymphocytes and macrophages, but there was a slight increase in the mean number of lung nodules at the 300 mg/kg bw dose."

Germ-free rats do not develop methemoglobinemia when intraperitoneally dosed with nitrobenzene. When nitrobenzene (200 mg/kg of body weight in sesame oil) was intraperitoneally administered to normal Sprague-Dawley rats, 30-40% of the hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood was converted to metHb within 1-2 hours. When the same dose was administered to germ-free or antibiotic-pretreated rats, there was no measurable metHb formation, even when measured up to 7 hours after treatment. The nitroreductase activities of various tissues (liver, kidney, gut wall) were not appreciably different in germ-free and control rats, but the activity was negligible in gut contents from germ-free rats and high in control rats. This led the authors to suggest that a nitrobenzene metabolite such as aniline (which is formed by the bacterial reduction of nitrobenzene in the intestines of rats) is involved in metHb formation."
