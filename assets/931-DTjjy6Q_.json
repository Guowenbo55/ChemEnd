In laboratory tests with sewage or sludge inoculums, 100% degradation was obtained in 7 days(2-3) while others got 0% BOD in 5 days(4-5). The lag period for naphthalene degradation decreased as groundwater was more polluted with fuel oil; the lag period was 1.2 and 1.9 days in heavily polluted and slightly polluted water, respectively versus 12 days for unpolluted water(6). Approximately 70% of naphthalene was lost in a pilot-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant due to biodegradation(7). In water, bacteria can utilize naphthalene only when it is in the dissolved state(8). Naphthalene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 2% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(9)."

The latter case indicates that some species of ubiquitous  micro flora present in clean groundwater is capable of degrading naphthalene(3). Naphthalene was found to biodegrade anaerobically in a Fe(III)-reducing, petroleum-contaminated sediment from an aquifer in Bemidji, MN; degradation was not found in methanogenic conditions or in Fe(III)-reducing sediments from other aquifers(4). In a sulfate reducing enriched culture of contaminated sediment, naphthalene was biodegraded to 2-naphthoic acid, which was further reduced to derivatives of 2-naphthoic acid(5). Naphthalene biodegraded 8, 8, and 22% in anoxic coal tar contaminated Boston Harbor sediment in 105, 220 and 342 days, respectively(6).

            "Value": "The mineralization of (14)C-labelled naphthalene was studied in pristine and oil-contaminated soil slurry (30% solids) under denitryfying conditions using a range of concentrations from below to above the aqueous phase saturation level. Results from sorption-desorption experiments indicated that naphthalene desorption was highly irreversible and decreased with an increase in the soil organic content, thus influencing the availability for microbial consumption. Under denitrifying conditions, the mineralization of naphthalene to CO2 occurred in parallel with the consumption of nitrate and an increase in pH from 7.0 to 8.6. When the initial substrate concentration was 50 ppm (ie close to the aqueous phase saturation level), about 90% of the total naphthalene was mineralized within 50 days, and a maximum mineralization rate of 1.3 ppm/day was achieved after a lag period of approx 18 days. When added at concentrations higher than the aqueous phase saturation level (200 and 500 ppm), similar mineralization rates (1.8 ppm/day) occurred until about 50 ppm of the naphthalene was mineralized. After that the mineralization rates decreased logarithmically to a minimum of 0.24 ppm/day for the rest of the 160 days of the experiments. For both of these higher concentrations, the reaction kinetics were independent of the concentration, indicating that desorption of the substrate governs the mineralization rate. Other results indicated that pre-exposure of soil to oil contamination did not improve the degradation rates nor reduce the lag periods. This study clearly shows the potential of denitrifying conditions for the biodegradation of low molecular weight polyaromatic hydrocarbons."

This paper describes a preliminary mode of action (MOA)/human relevance (HR) framework for NA. Species differences in both carcinogenic and cytotoxic responses between the rodent and human have been noted based on qualitative and quantitative differences in metabolism. Some occur at the initial oxidation of NA in the rat through CYP2F, versus CYP2A13 metabolism in the human respiratory system and which results in a difference in the specific naphthoquinone formed. Normally, subsequent reactive metabolites are then conjugated through glutathione, but high dose exposures, as in the rat bioassay, result in glutathione depletion, and the availability of 1,2-naphthoquinone for other conjugation. In the rat nose, it is proposed that a naphthoquinone imine is formed via a species and site-specific aryl amidase acting on an amino acid conjugate of the quinone. Such a quinone imine is believed to be the active agent in Alachlor and phenacetin, resulting in the same profile of respiratory tumors in the rat as NA. Based on the MOA and the limited epidemiological data indicating no human evidence of nasal or lung tumor risk, the carcinogenic response observed in rats does not appear relevant to the human."

To obtain mechanistic insight into NA-induced nasal carcinogenesis, NA dose-response was characterized in nasal epithelium using a tumor-relevant endpoint. Specifically, levels of p53 codon 271 CGT to CAT mutation were measured in nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium of NA-exposed male and female rats by allele-specific competitive blocker-PCR (ACB-PCR). Male and female, 8-9 week-old F344 rats (5 rats/group) were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 30ppm NA vapor for 13 weeks (6h/day, 5 days/week). The geometric mean p53 mutant fraction (MF) levels in nasal epithelium of control treatment groups ranged between 2.05 x 10(-5) and 3.05 x 10(-5). No significant dose-related changes in p53 mutant fraction (MF) were observed in the olfactory or respiratory epithelia of female rats. However, statistically significant treatment-related differences were observed in male respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with the p53 MF in the respiratory epithelium of male rats exposed to 30ppm NA significantly lower than that in controls. Further, a significant trend of decreasing p53 MF with increasing dose was observed in the male respiratory epithelium. Of the tissue types analyzed, respiratory epithelium is the most sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of NA, suggesting cytotoxicity may be responsible for the loss of p53 mutation. Because ACB-PCR has been used successfully to detect the effects of known mutagenic carcinogens, the absence of any significant increases in p53 MF associated with NA exposure adds to the weight of evidence that NA does not operate through a directly mutagenic mode of action."

To investigate its mechanism of metabolic activation and cancer initiation, mice were topically treated with naphthalene or one of its metabolites, 1-naphthol, 1,2-dihydrodiolnaphthalene (1,2-DDN), 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,2-DHN), and 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ). After 4 h, the mice were sacrificed, the treated skin was excised, and the depurinating and stable DNA adducts were analyzed. The depurinating adducts were identified and quantified by ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, whereas the stable adducts were quantified by (32)P-postlabeling. For comparison, the stable adducts formed when a mixture of the four deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates was treated with 1,2-NQ or enzyme-activated naphthalene were also analyzed. The depurinating adducts 1,2-DHN-1-N3Ade and 1,2-DHN-1-N7Gua arise from reaction of 1,2-NQ with DNA. Similarly, the major stable adducts appear to derive from the 1,2-NQ. The depurinating DNA adducts are, in general, the most abundant. Therefore, naphthalene undergoes metabolic activation to the electrophilic ortho-quinone, 1,2-NQ, which reacts with DNA to form depurinating adducts. This is the same mechanism as other weak carcinogens, such as the natural and synthetic estrogens, and benzene."

The aim of this study was to determine whether mouse CYP2A5, abundantly expressed in nasal olfactory mucosa (OM) and the liver, but less in the lung, plays a major role in the bioactivation and toxicity of NA in the OM. We found, by comparing Cyp2a5-null and wild-type (WT) mice, that the loss of CYP2A5 expression led to substantial decreases in rates of NA metabolic activation by OM microsomes. The loss of CYP2A5 did not cause changes in systemic clearance of NA (at 200 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the Cyp2a5-null mice were much more resistant than were WT mice to NA-induced nasal toxicity (although not lung toxicity), when examined at 24 hours after NA dosing (at 200 mg/kg, i.p.), or to NA-induced depletion of total nonprotein sulfhydryl in the OM (although not in the lung), examined at 2 hours after dosing. Thus, mouse CYP2A5 plays an essential role in the bioactivation and toxicity of NA in the OM, but not in the lung.

Doses utilized in the 14-day study were 27, 53, and 267 mg/kg, with the latter representing one-half of the male LD50. Both males and females demonstrated a 5-10% mortality and depressed body weight at the high dose only. Males had decreased thymus weights, and females had decreased spleen and increased lung weights at the high dose only. Other organ weights were unaffected at any dosage level. Serum enzyme and electrolyte levels were not altered in a dose-related manner. To assess the potential immunotoxicity of naphthalene the following screen was utilized: humoral immune response, response to mitogens, delayed hypersensitivity response, popliteal lymph node response, bone marrow stem cell number, and DNA synthesis. No evidence of immunotoxicity was demonstrated. The 90-day study employed daily oral doses of 5.3, 53, and 133 mg/kg. There was no treatment-related mortality in either sex, nor was body weight affected. Organ weights were not affected in males, and females showed reduced spleen weights only at the high dose. Serum enzyme and electrolyte levels, as well as the immunotoxicity screen, indicated that naphthalene doses up to one-fourth the LD50 for 90 days failed to elicit consistent statistically significant and biologically relevant compound-related effects. A screen of the effects of the 90-day naphthalene treatment on various aspects of the hepatic drug metabolizing system indicated no alterations, with the exception of a specific dose-related inhibition of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in both male and female mice."

Recently PGP9.5 expression has been found to be upregulated in the pulmonary epithelium of smokers and in non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting that it also plays a role in carcinogen-inflicted lung epithelial injury and carcinogenesis. We investigated the expression of PGP9.5 in mice in response to two prominent carcinogens found in tobacco smoke: Naphthalene and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). By immunostaining, we found that PGP9.5 protein was highly expressed throughout the airway epithelium in the days immediately following a single injection of naphthalene. In contrast, PGP9.5 was exclusively confined to neurons and neuroendocrine cells in the control and NNK-exposed lungs. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of PGP9.5 mRNA in the lungs by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). PGP9.5 mRNA expression was highly upregulated in the days immediately following naphthalene injection and gradually returning to that of control mice 5 days after naphthalene injection. In contrast, exposure to NNK did not result in a significant increase in PGP9.5 mRNA 10 weeks after exposure. No increased expression of two other neuroendocrine markers was found in the non-neuroendocrine epithelial cells after naphthalene exposure. In contrast, immunostaining for the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1), which has previously been associated with PGP9.5 in lung cancer cells, revealed transient downregulation of p27(Kip1) in naphthalene exposed airways compared to controls, indicating that the rise in PGP9.5 in the airway epithelium is related to downregulation of p27(Kip1). This study ... /identifies/ the carcinogen naphthalene as an inducer of PGP9.5 expression in non-neuroendocrine epithelium after acute lung injury and further strengthens the accumulating evidence of PGP9.5 as a central player in lung epithelial damage and early carcinogenesis."

The t1/2 of naphthalene oxide is 4 min in Waymouth's medium. Addition of 5% bovine serum albumin of the medium increased the half-life of the epoxide to 11 min. Perfusion of the lung with 0.2 or 2 umol of naphthalene oxide decreased pulmonary reduced glutathione levels of 62 and 42% of control, respectively. 1,4-Naphthoquinone and naphthol glucuronide represented 36 and 25% of the total polar metabolites isolated after infusion of naphthalene oxide, whereas dihydrodiol and thioether conjugates were minor metabolites. In comparison, thioethers and dihydrodiol were the primary metabolites isolated from lungs perfused with (14)C naphthalene. Histologic examination of the lungs fixed 4 hr after infusion of naphthalene oxide (0.25-1.0 umol/60 min) revealed selective vacuolation and necrosis of Clara cells, significant decreases in the mass of bronchiolar Clara cells and increases in the mass of vacuolated cells. Injury to lungs perfused with naphthalene or secondary metabolites such as naphthoquinones, 1-naphthol and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene was less dramatic. In contrast to other studies implicating quinones as mediators of aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity, the current work suggests that epoxides play a significant role in naphthalene-induced lung injury.

Subchronic exposure (90 day) of mice to naphthalene does not alter humoral and cellular-mediated immune responses, whereas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, are known to be immunosuppressive. To understand these differences, the antibody-forming cell (AFC) responses of splenocyte cultures exposed to naphthalene (2, 20, and 200 uM) were evaluated. At these concentrations, the antibody-forming cell response to sheep red blood cells (RBC) was not affected. To determine if reactive metabolites of naphthalene were immunosuppressive, splenocytes were exposed to naphthalene metabolites by direct addition or through the use of a metabolic activation system. The addition of 1-naphthol (70 and 200 uM) and 1,4-naphthoquinone (2, 7, and 20 uM) resulted in a decreased antibody-forming cell response. Suppression of AFC responses was also obtained by culturing splenocytes with liver S9 and naphthalene. Since splenic metabolism of naphthalene to nonimmunosuppressive metabolites may account for the absence of immunotoxicity, the types of naphthalene metabolites generated by splenic microsomes were determined. It was observed that splenic microsomes were unable to generate any detectable naphthalene metabolites, whereas liver microsomes were able to generate both 1,2-naphthalene diol and 1-naphthol. Thus, the absence of an immunosuppressive effect by naphthalene exposure may be related to the inability of splenocytes to metabolize naphthalene. Moreover, the concentration of naphthalene metabolites generated within the liver that may diffuse to the spleen may be inadequate to produce immunotoxicity."

Females have sex differences in airway epithelial responses and in the prevalence of certain airway diseases. Male and female mice were exposed to a tolerance-inducing regimen of NA, and lungs were examined by airway level to characterize the cellular changes associated with repeated NA exposure and to assess the expression of genes and proteins involved in NA bioactivation and detoxification. The airway epithelium in treated males resembled that of controls. Females in the tolerant state were characterized by dense populations of ciliated cells in midlevel, distal, and bifurcating airways and a lower abundance of Clara cells at all airway levels. Cytotoxicity following a secondary challenge dose was also greater in females than males. Furthermore, females had decreased gene/protein expression of CYP2F2, a P-450 that metabolizes NA to a toxic epoxide, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, than NA-tolerant males at all airway levels examined. We conclude that, while females develop tolerance, sex differences exist in the tolerant state by airway level, and females remain more susceptible than males to repeated exposures to NA."

            "Value": "The mean Koc value of naphthalene in 17 soils throughout the US was 871(1). The Koc of naphthalene in 5 different soils from Japan ranged from 440-830(2). In a long term field experiment in Uppsala, Sweden, soils were treated with 7 types of amendments and 1 untreated plot, Koc values were 112-680 for naphthalene(3). In a contaminated soil collected from a railway station in Spain, naphthalene had a log Koc of 3.97(4). The mean Koc value of naphthalene in sediment samples from 2 ponds and 1 river from north Georgia, US was 1,300(5). The log Koc value in sediment was 2.84(6). In 76 sediment samples from 7 sites in New York and 1 in North Carolina, naphthalene had log Koc values of 2.45-5.59(7). According to a classification scheme(8), these Koc values suggest that naphthalene is expected to have high to no mobility in soil(SRC)."
