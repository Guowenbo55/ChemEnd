            "content": "Chlorflurenol methyl, while demonstrating notable root bud activity stimulation at a rate of 0.6 kg/ha, induces effects such as terminal growth inhibition and leaf abnormalities. It exhibits strong acropetal and weak basipetal movement within the plant. Interestingly, chlorflurenol methyl considerably amplifies the leaf absorption and subsequent root translocation of dicamba, a herbicide, when applied simultaneously. The root exudation of dicamba is also augmented under the influence of chlorflurenol methyl. However, the pre-treatment with chlorflurenol methyl before dicamba application shows limited impact on enhancing root translocation, posing an intriguing area for further exploration. Field experiments display consistent enhancement in Canada thistle control with the combined application of dicamba and chlorflurenol, especially at lower dicamba rates and in May. ",
