    "Description": "Fluvalinate is an organochlorine insecticide, an organochlorine acaricide, an organofluorine insecticide, an organofluorine acaricide, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a nitrile, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and an aromatic ether. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide, a pyrethroid ester acaricide and an agrochemical. It is functionally related to a valine.",

            "content": "Fluvalinate, studied at field use rates on various plants, predominantly undergoes hydrolysis, resulting in an anilino acid (2) primarily found in small quantities as the free acid or as conjugated metabolites. Minimal translocation within plants was observed for fluvalinate and its metabolites. Even though some metabolites like 4\u2019-Hydroxyfluvalinate (4) and 2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline (3) were detected in plant tissues, they were found in limited amounts (up to 4% of the applied dose) and were not significantly translocated. The pesticide residues in stems, seeds, or other parts of the plants remained notably low, indicating negligible movement within the plant system. This limited internal mobility aligns with observations from other pyrethroids like permethrin and fenvalerate in different plants. Despite some metabolites being found in various plant parts, the overall conclusion is that fluvalinate and its breakdown products exhibit minimal translocation within treated plants.",
