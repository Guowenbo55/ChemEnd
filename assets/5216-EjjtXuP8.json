            "Value": "AEROBIC: Simazine has been confirmed to be resistant to biodegradation in the Japanese MITI test which utilizes inoculum composed of sewage, soil and natural waters(1). Removal of simazine during biological sewage treatment has been reported to be unlikely, even after prolonged exposure to the biota(2). The simazine ring structure is neither cleaved nor utilized by anaerobic microorganisms(3). 14(C)-labeled simazine is slowly mineralized in a clay-lime soil as evidenced by the release of 10.4% of the theoretical yield of (14)CO2 after incubation for 110 days; no degradation of simazine was detected in a soil suspension test without the addition of glucose as an energy source suggesting that degradation of simazine in these soil experiments was due to co-metabolism(4). The products of microbial degradation of simazine in soil include 2-chloro-4-amino-6-ethylamino-1,3,5-triazine and 2,4-dihydroxy-6-amino-1,3,5-triazine(5). It has been reported that simazine and other s-triazines can be utilized by certain soil microorganisms as a source of energy(5). The decrease in simazine concn in a soil-solution enrichment culture microbial degradation system was 18% in 10 days(5). After 150 days incubation in soil lysimeters, only 3% of the applied simazine was present in lysimeter cores taken from a meadow soil, while up to 26% of simazine was present in lysimeter cores taken from a gravel track; the greater degradation in the meadow soil was partially attributed to a higher microbial biomass(6). During 6 months incubation in coarse sandy soils at 15 \u00b0C, approx. 4 to 7% of the applied (14)C-ring-labeled-simazine was evolved as (14)CO2(7). Evolution of (14)CO2 during 184 days was 5.8% of the added simazine in fertilized moraine sand soil without previous pesticide treatment and 4.2% in unfertilized(7). In moraine sand previously treated with glyphosate, 6.4% of added simazine was evolved as (14)CO2 in unfertilized soil; 5.5% was evolved as (14)CO2 in fertilized soil(7). 5.1 and 7.1% of applied (14)C-simazine was evolved as (14)CO2 from fertilized and unfertilized sand soils, respectively(7). Complete mineralization of the s-triazine ring to CO2 by microbial degradation of triazine herbicides is typically low, 0.5 to 5%, in soil(8). In a study of bioavailability of simazine, using soil from a 20-year continuous corn field treated annually with simazine, 48% of the added (14)C-simazine was biodegraded during the 34-day incubation period; no biodegradation of the native aged simazine residues was observed(8)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Simazine, at an initial concn of 100 mg/L, reached 0.7% of its theoretical BOD over 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(1). 4.4, 4.4, and 32.8% biodegradation of simazine was observed following 3, 6, and 9 hours incubation in activated sludge, respectively(2). Using the cultivation method to measure biodegradation in surface water samples from three ponds in Nagoya City, Japan, simazine biodegradation ranged from 0 to 30% after four days incubation; after 7 days incubation, biodegradation ranged from 0 to 24%(3). 90 days after the addition of uniformly ring-labeled (14)C-simazine to Lima silt loam, approx. 7% was mineralized; approx. 17% mineralization was observed after 90 days following a second application of the herbicide to the soil, 90 days after the first(4). Half-lives of simazine in soil biometer systems under standard (simulated outdoor) conditions using a silty loam and a silty sand were 77 (63) and 87 (91) days, respectively; half-lives in outdoor fallow (grown with barley) lysimeters using a silty sand and a silty loam were 32 (35) and 49 (53) days, respectively(5). In the biometer experiments, (14)CO2-evolution in the silty sand under standard (simulated outdoor) conditions was 17 (0.8) and 21 (1.2)% of the initial total radioactivity after 64 and 100 days, respectively; (14)CO2-evolution in the silty loam under standard (simulated outdoor) conditions was (3.6) and 4.9 (4.8)% of the initial total radioactivity after 64 and 100 days, respectively(5). N-Desethyl simazine and 2-chloro-4,6-bisamino-s-triazine were identified as metabolites(5). In Po River water, an initial simazine concn of 5 ug/L was reduced to 3.1 and 2.5 ug/L after 24 and 384 hours incubation, respectively(6). Microbial breakdown in soil results in degradation of simazine at very variable rates, half-lives range from 27 to 102 days (median 49 days); temperature and moisture are the main factors affecting the rates(7).  The dissipation rate of simazine was studied in 2 tropical soils obtained from Brazil(8).  The time for 50% dissipation, 75% dissipation, and 90% dissipation (DT50, DT75, and DT90, respectively) of simazine applied at a rate of 2 kg/ha to a sandy clay soil (50% sand, 47% clay, 3% silt, pH 5.1) adjusted to 40% of its water holding capacity was 14.2, 28.4, and 49.3 days, respectively(8).  The time DT50, DT75, and DT90, of simazine applied at a rate of 2 kg/ha to a sandy loam (86% sand, 13% clay, 1% silt, pH 4.2) adjusted to 40% of its water holding capacity was 26.6, 58.1, and >80 days, respectively(8)."

Specifically, several triazines can alter hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) levels. In both humans and rats, hypothalamic GnRH controls pituitary hormone secretion, i.e., LH and PRL. The result of changes in GnRH and catecholamines in turn leads to alterations in pituitary LH and PRL secretion. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis is involved in the development of the reproductive system, and its maintenance and functioning in adulthood. Additionally, reproductive hormones modulate the function of numerous other metabolic processes (i.e., bone formation, and immune, central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular systems."

            "Value": "After subchronic and chronic exposure to simazine, a variety of species were shown to exhibit neuroendocrine effects resulting in both reproductive and developmental consequences that are considered relevant to humans. These effects are biomarkers of a neuroendocrine mechanism of toxicity that is shared by several other structurally-related chlorinated triazines including atrazine, propazine, and three chlorinated degradates -des-isopropyl atrazine or DIA, and des-ethyl atrazine or DEA, and iaminochlorotriazine or DACT - the first and last of which can result from the degradation of simazine. These six compounds disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, part of the central nervous system, causing cascading changes to hormone levels and developmental delays. These neuroendocrine effects are considered the primary toxicological effects of regulatory concern for all subchronic and chronic exposure scenarios including dietary risk from food and drinking water, residential risk, and occupational risk. Simazine's two chlorinated degradates, DIA and DACT, are considered to have toxicity equal to the parent compound in respect to their common neuroendocrine mechanism of toxicity. Another degradate, hydroxy-simazine, was identified, which is expected to have a different toxicological profile from simazine based on the toxicological data available for an analogous metabolite for atrazine, hydroxy-atrazine."

As a result of their common mechanism of toxicity, exposure to simazine, like exposure to atrazine, results in reproductive and developmental effects and consequences that are considered relevant to humans. ...This mechanism involves a central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, specifically, neurotransmitter and neuropeptide alterations at the level of the hypothalamus, which cause cascading changes to hormone levels, e.g., suppression of the luteinizing hormone surge prior to ovulation resulting in prolonged estrus in adult female rats (demonstrated with atrazine and simazine), and developmental delays, i.e., delayed vaginal opening and preputial separation in developing rats (studied in atrazine but not simazine). ...This CNS mechanism of toxicity also results in mammary tumors specific to female Sprague- Dawley rats exposed to simazine and atrazine; however, the particular cascade of events leading to tumor formation in this specific strain of rat is not considered to be operative in humans. Consequently, atrazine has been classified as \"Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.\""

Based upon soil column, soil thin-layer chromatography, and Koc experiments, the mobility of simazine is expected to vary from slight to high in soil-types ranging from clay soils to sandy loam soils, respectively(3). Adsorption of simazine in soil has been observed to increase as titratable acidity, organic matter and, to a lesser extent, cation exchange capacity, and clay content of the soil increased(3,4,5). Soil structural effects may be more important than adsorption in determining movement of simazine in some soils(6).

Koc values ranging from 103 to 277 were determined in 12 soils, median 160(2). A mean Koc of 1054 was determined in two sandy loam soils(3). In one soil Koc values ranged from 247 (depth 0 to 30 cm) to 3,559 (depth 165+ cm); Koc values in the second soil ranged from 361 (depth 0 to 27 cm) to 1,690 (depth 53 to 61 cm)(3). Koc values of 78 and 80 were measured using the sorption isotherms for (14)C-simazine in Capac soil following 24 and 48 hours equilibration, respectively(4). Koc values of 1,340 and 1,182 were measured using the desorption of aged simazine residues in Capac soil, with over 20 continuous years of annual simazine application, following 24 and 48 hours equilibration, respectively(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these Koc values suggest that simazine is expected to have high to slight mobility in soil(SRC). The total release of aged simazine from Capac soil with over 20 continuous years of annual simazine application was 32% of the predicted equilibrium concentration after 16 days; in contrast, desorption of recently added simazine was within 90% of the calculated equilibrium concentration within 1 to 24 hours(4)."

Chromatographic analysis of exudate from detopped parrotfeather plants indicated that simazine was being tranlocated primarily as the intact molecule. A correlation coefficient of 0.985 was observed between the amount of simazine-14C removed from the treatment solution and transpiration during a 6-hr period. Absorption of simazine-14C by parrotfeather roots of intact plants was linear for the first 4 hr followed by a gradual decrease at the end of 6 hr. Simazine-14C at 1 and 2 hr after root applications was highest in the roots, intermediate in the lower part of the shoot, and lowest in the upper part of the shoot. After 192 hr, simazine-14C accumulated in the top of the shoot in a concentration higher than in the lower part of the shoot or the roots. A correlation coefficient of 0.988 was found between the amount of simazine-14C present in the tissue and the treatment concentration over a range of 1.2 \u00d7 10-6 to 5.0 \u00d7 10-6M.",

Simazine was found to be readily absorbed and distributed in the spruce seedlings. A positive relationship between the amount of simazine absorbed and the growth intensities of the plants indicates an active mechanism of uptake. A fixation of simazine in roots and stem was observed. Simazine was degraded by roots and stem to hydroxysimazine and two other unknown metabolites. No simazine and only metabolites could be traced in the needles, indicating a very rapid rate of metabolism in the root system. The glucose derivative of benzoxazinone was extracted from all parts of the spruce seedlings and is probably responsible for the hydrolysis of simazine. The results indicate a very slow degradation of the metabolites to CO2 as one of the final products.",
