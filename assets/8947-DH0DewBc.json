DSMA, when foliarly applied, demonstrated both acropetal (upward) and basipetal (downward) translocation in the plant. Approximately 25% of the arsenic intercepted by the leaves was transported to the roots and rhizomes within five days, although soil uptake of DSMA was restricted compared to foliar or nutrient solution uptake. Radioautographs showed DSMA movement through the vascular system, primarily concentrated in vascular bundles, suggesting translocation through these routes. Despite some indications of complexing with plant components, the molecule appeared largely intact, showing mobility in the plant despite potential complex formation. The study also observed high arsenic residues in leaves and roots following foliar application, indicating both upward and downward movement of DSMA. The study suggested that DSMA, despite potential complexing with plant components, remained mobile within the plant, emphasizing its translocation in Coastal bermudagrass. Moreover, regrowth analysis after clipping demonstrated reduced arsenic residues, indicating minimal movement of DSMA into new growth, while the reduction in arsenic content in the roots over time implied release into the soil solution. Additionally, the study noted relationships between foliage presence, arsenic concentration, and percent recovery in Coastal, highlighting the effects of foliage amount on DSMA interception and translocation in the plant.",
