However, it proved to be readily biodegradable in the 28-day OECD screening test and inherently biodegradable in a 31-day Zahn-Wellens test, exhibiting a final degradation level of >90% in both tests(3). An adaptation period of 7-20 days was required before degradation occurred. The final level of degradation was also >90% in a laboratory-scale wastewater treatment plant, but the adaptation period was 10-21 days(3)."

However, in another study, two organisms were isolated that could grow on and degrade morpholine as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy(4). The organisms were isolated from sludge taken from an industrial biological treatment plant and incubation was at 30 \u00b0C in agitated flasks. Initial morpholine concentration was 10 mmol/L (871 mg/L) in a mineral salts medium. In addition, >98% of influent morpholine (1 mmol/L) was removed in a laboratory scale activated sludge unit operated for about 6 months. Incubation temperature was 20-30 \u00b0C, feed pH was 7.5, and retention time was reduced from 160 to 20 hrs over a 6 month period(4)."

While sludges from all treatment plants had the ability to degrade morpholine, the number of morpholine degrading microbes was so low and the lag times so long that it was deemed unlikely that significant amounts of morpholine would be degraded during sewage treatment. Due to their slow growth, morpholine degraders could establish themselves only if the mean solids retention time of the plant was 8 days or longer. Of the 58 die-away tests performed on 29 samples using water from 11 sites in 3 river systems in Yorkshire, UK, only 3 failed to biodegrade morpholine or contain detectable numbers of morpholine degrading microorganisms. It was found that the number of morpholine degraders increased and the die-away time decreased as the water passed downstream. There was no correlation between water quality and the ability of microbes in the water to degrade morpholine. However, the investigators concluded that it was unlikely that significant morpholine degradation occurred in these rivers and because of the long lag periods, ranging from approximately 6 to 50 days, it was doubtful that these rivers could degrade morpholine rapidly in the event of a spill(1)."

For sensitization studies the animals were exposed to about 0.1 g of each compound in a concentration of 5% of the amount needed to produce minimal intensity erythema from the irritant test. Test materials were removed after 24 hr. The procedure was repeated 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Two weeks after the final induction, the challenge test was performed. The left flank of the test animals was shaved, and 0.1, 0.5, and 2% dose preparations of each induction compound were applied. Materials were removed after 24 hr and readings taken at 1, 24, 48 hr and 7 days after removal. Cross sensitization studies were also performed. The sensitization potential was greatest for DTDM, with MMBT being the next strongest. MBT was also a sensitizer, but morpholine was not. The intensity and percent of reactions to challenge depended on the concentration of the test compound. A variety of cross sensitization reactions occurred suggesting that the morpholine ring alone was not able to induce sensitization; on association with a disulfide bond, it became a strong sensitizing agent. The sensitization potential of MBT appeared directly related to the sulfhydryl functional group in the benzothiazole structure."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ /N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide/ (NMMO) (0.0001-10 mg/mL) and other putative metabolites, N-hydroxymorpholine (0.0001-1 mg/mL) and 3-morpholinone (0.001-0.1 mg/mL), did not induce DNA repair at the non-toxic concentrations tested. The polyurethane foam catalyst, N-butylmorpholine (0.0001-0.1 mg/mL) was also inactive in the primary rat hepatocyte/DNA repair assay. The chemical intermediate N-hydroxyethylmorpholine induced DNA repair within the dose range 1-5 mg/mL. The genotoxicity of substituted morpholines might be a function of the substituent moiety rather than morpholine itself."

The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was negative, and equivocably positive results were obtained in the Chinese hamster ovary sister chromatid exchange test.

            "Value": "The Koc of morpholine is estimated as 7.4(SRC), using a log Kow of -0.86(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that morpholine is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of morpholine is 8.49(4), indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
