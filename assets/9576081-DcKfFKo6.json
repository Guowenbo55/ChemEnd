            "content": "The study elucidates the systemic characteristics of oxabetrinil, a safener used in grain sorghum cultivation. When applied to imbibed sorghum seeds, oxabetrinil was taken up predominantly by the seeds, exhibiting greater and more rapid uptake compared to CGA-133205, another safener investigated in the study. The absorbed oxabetrinil was primarily concentrated in the coleoptiles of germinating sorghum seedlings, indicating its systemic translocation within the plant. Although very little translocation of oxabetrinil occurred to the roots, there was notable redistribution to the coleoptiles of the germinated seedlings. The study suggests that the radioactivity from the absorbed oxabetrinil may either directly move into the coleoptiles as they emerge or be translocated to the coleoptiles after uptake through the seed. Additionally, oxabetrinil showed signs of metabolism in sorghum tissues, resulting in the formation of water-soluble metabolites over time. Interestingly, oxabetrinil's treatment of sorghum seeds increased the uptake of the herbicide metolachlor, suggesting an influence on the plant's ability to absorb other compounds. Furthermore, oxabetrinil and CGA-133205 both enhanced the rate of metolachlor metabolism by conjugating it to glutathione, a process that is crucial in herbicide detoxification. Overall, oxabetrinil demonstrates systemic movement within the grain sorghum plant, concentrating in the coleoptiles and potentially influencing the plant's uptake and metabolism of other herbicidal compounds like metolachlor.",

Imbibed seeds were treated with radiolabeled oxabetrinil ([14C]oxabetrinil) and CGA-133205 ([14C]CGA-133205), and the uptake of both safeners by grain sorghum increased over the 72-hour duration of the experiment. A higher percentage of the applied oxabetrinil was taken up compared to CGA-133205. However, there was very little translocation of either safener to the roots. The total amount of extractable oxabetrinil and CGA-133205 from the coleoptiles (the protective sheath covering the emerging shoot) of grain sorghum increased with time. The water-soluble portion of the extracted radioactivity also increased over time, indicating that both safeners were metabolized by the grain sorghum seedlings. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the water-soluble extracts revealed that a small portion of the safener oxabetrinil may conjugate with glutathione in sorghum. However, the safener CGA-133205 did not conjugate with glutathione. Unidentified metabolites of [14C]oxabetrinil and [14C]CGA-133205 were detected. Treating grain sorghum with oxabetrinil increased the uptake of radiolabeled metolachlor, a herbicide, but did not affect its translocation. On the other hand, treating grain sorghum with CGA-133205 increased the amount of radiolabel from metolachlor that translocated to the roots. Both oxabetrinil and CGA-133205 increased the rate of metabolism of [14C]metolachlor to a water-soluble metabolite during the initial 4 hours after application, but not at 8 hours. TLC analysis of water-soluble extracts from grain sorghum coleoptiles 4 hours after application of [14C]metolachlor revealed that both safeners increased the formation of the glutathione conjugate of metolachlor and concurrently decreased the amount of parent metolachlor in the extract.",
