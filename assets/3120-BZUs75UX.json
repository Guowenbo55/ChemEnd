    "Description": "Diuron is a member of the class of 3-(3,4-substituted-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylureas that is urea in which both of the hydrogens attached to one nitrogen are substituted by methyl groups, and one of the hydrogens attached to the other nitrogen is substituted by a 3,4-dichlorophenyl group. It has a role as a photosystem-II inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a mitochondrial respiratory-chain inhibitor and a urea herbicide. It is a dichlorobenzene and a 3-(3,4-substituted-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea.",

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Diuron, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its Theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(1). In a Zahn-Wellens inherent biodegradability test, 50 mg/L of diuron was found to be not inherently biodegradable with 0% degradation in activated sludge inoculum after 28 days(2). Degradation of diuron in natural soils was found to be slow and incomplete(3). Inoculation of a sandy C-horizon with a diuron-degrading bacterial strain led to substantial diuron degradation, but the addition of purified fulvic acid and humic acid to these inoculated soils decreased this degradation, suggesting that adsorption to humic substances in soil hinders degradation(3). In soil, enzymatic and microbial demethylation of the nitrogen atom and hydroxylation at position 2 of the benzene ring occurs. Duration of activity in soil is about 4 to 8 months, depending on soil type and humidity, with a half-life of 90 to 180 days(4). In a 22 week laboratory study conducted at 27 \u00b0C and 60% relative humidity, approximately 40% degradation occurred in Cecil loamy sand (1 ppm applied 4 times) and Brookstone silty clay loam (5 ppm applied 4 times)(5). Biological degradation of diuron in soil increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increasing concentration; little degradation was noted at 0 \u00b0C in 20 weeks whereas substantial degradation occurred in 10 weeks in two soils at 10 ppm and 20 \u00b0C, degradation of 15 ppm was only noted in one of these soils when incubated at 20 \u00b0C(6-7). Less than 20% of diuron (60 ppm) added to soil was detoxified within 8 weeks and there was little effect on the degradation rate when the soils were titrated to different pH's between 4.3 and 7.5(8). Degradation of diuron in soil was stimulated by amendment of the soil with manure but inhibited by sludge amendment(9). Diuron is 67-99% degraded in 10 weeks under aerobic conditions by mixed cultures isolated (mixed bacterial, mixed fungal/bacterial) from pond water and sediment with 3,4-dichloroaniline being the major product(10). 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea (CPDU) were also identified(10)."

The effects on the urothelium after short-term exposure have not been described. The present 7-day study evaluated the dose-dependency of urothelial alterations in the urinary bladder using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Male Wistar rats were fed 0, 125, 500, 2500 ppm diuron for 7 days. The urinary bladder and isolated urothelial cells of these animals were processed for microscopic examination and gene expression profiling, respectively. No significant treatment-related morphologic effects were observed. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the exposed groups increased with diuron levels. Diuron-altered genes involved in cell-to-cell interactions and tissue organization were identified in all treatment groups. After 7 days of diuron exposure, transcriptional responses were observed in the urothelium in the absence of clear morphologic changes. These morphological findings are different from those observed in a previous study in which 20 weeks of diuron exposure was associated with simple hyperplasia secondary to the persistent cytotoxicity and necrosis associated with continuous cellular regeneration. Comparison of the gene expression profiles of rats exposed to the 2500 ppm carcinogenic diuron dose for 7 days versus 20 weeks revealed few similarities between these two time points at the gene or pathway level. Taken together, these data provide insight into the dose- and temporal-dependent morphological and transcriptional changes associated with diuron exposure that may lead to the development of tumors in the rat urinary bladder."

The currently suggested non-genotoxic mode of action (MOA) of diuron encompasses in succession urothelial necrosis induced by direct cytotoxicity, regenerative cell proliferation and sustained urothelial hyperplasia that increases the likelihood of neoplasia development. This study evaluated the dose-response profile of urothelial histological and ultrastructural lesions induced by diuron. Sixty male Wistar rats were fed ad libitum diuron mixed in the diet at 0, 60, 125, 500, 1250, or 2500 ppm for 20 weeks. The incidences of urothelial simple hyperplasia and the cell proliferation index were significantly increased in the diuron-fed 1250 and 2500 ppm groups.

Histological urothelial lesions in the urinary bladder and in the renal pelvis mucosa, cell proliferation/apoptosis evaluations, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the urinary bladder mucosa were also performed. No DNA changes were found in urothelial or peripheral blood cells, and urinary pH was comparable to controls in all Diuron groups.

By SEM, three of five animals treated with 2500 ppm Diuron showed urothelial cell necrosis and hyperplasia. In the renal pelvis, the incidence of SH was significantly increased in the Diuron 500 and 2500 ppm and in the NaS 8.3% groups.

Non-fasted urine was collected weeks 4, 8, and 12 for determination of pH. Limited pathology was conducted at termination (week 13). The urinary bladder of CD males was fixed in formalin while the bladders of Wistar rats (both sexes) were ligated, infused with fixative, and then immersed in fixative.  The difference in method of fixation presented a problem in comparison of the incidence/severity of the bladder mucosal hyperplasia of the two strains in males. Treatment with diuron resulted in decreases in body weight, weight gain, food consumption, and food efficiency. Urine pH of non-fasted rats was higher (approx 0.5 pH units) when fed Altromin compared with Purina diet. Diuron in the diet had no significant effect on the pH. Treatment with diuron increased spleen weight, size, and microscopic changes (extramedullary hematopoiesis, congestion, and increased pigment). These effects may have been associated with increased red cell turnover. Minimal to moderate hyperplasia of the renal pelvis transitional epithelium was noted in all groups of males exposed to diuron with no effect of diet or strain. Wistar males fed diuron in Altromin diet had a higher incidence of diffuse urinary bladder hyperplasia than males fed Purina diet (6/10 with Altromin versus 1/10 with Purina). The opposite was found in female Wistar rats. CD male rats fed either diet had a greater incidence and severity than Wistar rats for urinary bladder hyperplasia, but this may have been related to the methods of fixation, which were not the same. Analysis of the urine for metabolites showed that no parent compound was present in urine. Recovery of radioactivity ranged from 73.7% to 82.7% with a slightly longer t1/2 in females. Urinary metabolites were identified by HPLC/mass spectroscopy and co-chromatograpy.

Diuron is registered for both occupational and residential uses and is used worldwide for more than 30 different crops. The proposed rat urothelial mode of action (MOA) for this herbicide consists of metabolic activation to metabolites that are excreted and concentrated in the urine, leading to cytotoxicity, urothelial cell necrosis and exfoliation, regenerative hyperplasia, and eventually tumors. We show evidence for this MOA for diuron using the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) conceptual framework for evaluating an MOA for chemical carcinogens, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and IPCS framework for assessing human relevance."

Accordingly, diuron has been categorized as a \"likely human carcinogen\" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although the carcinogenesis-initiating activity of diuron has been reported in an early initiation-promotion mouse skin study, its genotoxic potential has been disputed. It is necessary to clarify the mode of action through which it has caused rodent neoplasia and verify its relevance to humans. Herein, two experiments were developed to verify the initiating and promoting potentials of diuron in a twenty-three- and a twenty-one-week-long mouse skin carcinogenesis protocol. In one, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was the solvent for the herbicide; in the other, acetone was the alternative solvent in order to verify whether DMSO had inhibitory influence on a potential cutaneous carcinogenic activity. The adopted schedule for the tumor-promoting agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in skin ulcers, which demonstrates the need for careful selection of TPA dose levels and frequency of application in this model. In both studies, diuron did not exert any influence on the skin carcinogenesis process, in contrast with results already reported in the literature."

Since it was previously established that diazinon and diuron cause effects at the whole-organism level, this study assessed the suborganismic responses to exposure to these pesticides and the enzymatic responses (biochemical level) and the gene expression changes (molecular level) were analyzed. /Four exposure scenarios were employed: 1) fertilized eggs were exposed for 48 hr - \"early exposure\" (2 hpf - 50 hpf exposure), 2) fertilized eggs were exposed for 96 hr - \"prolonged exposure\" (2 hpf - 98 hpf exposure), 3) fertilized eggs were first placed in artificial water for 48 hr and then exposed for 48 hr - \"late exposure\" (50 hpf - 98 hpf exposure), 4) fertilized eggs were exposed for 48 hr and then placed in artificial water for 48 hr recovery - \"recovery exposure\" (2 hpf - 50 hpf exposure, 50 hpf - 98 hpf recovery)./ ... The following endpoints measured: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities; and gene expressions of the corresponding genes: acetylcholinesterase (ache), carboxylesterase (ces2), cytochrome P450 (cyp1a), glutathione-S-transferase (gstp1), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx1a) and additionally glutathione reductase (gsr). Significant changes at both the biochemical and the molecular level were detected. In addition, different sensitivities of different developmental stages of zebrafish were determined and partial recovery of the enzyme activity 48 hr after the end of the exposure was observed. The observed disparity between gene expression changes and alterations in enzyme activities points to the necessity of monitoring changes at different levels of biological organization. Different exposure scenarios, together with a comparison of the responses at the biochemical and molecular level, provide valuable data on the effects of diazinon and diuron on low organizational levels in zebrafish embryos and larvae."

            "Value": "/BEHAVIORAL STUDIES/ The use of zebrafish for aquatic vertebrate (eco)toxicity testing allows the assessment of effects on a wide range of biological levels - from enzymes to sensory organs and behavioral endpoints. The present study investigated the effects of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron regarding the acute toxicity and behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae. After conducting the fish embryo toxicity test, three concentrations (1, 2 and 3.5 mg/L for diazinon and 1, 2 and 3.8 mg/L for diuron) were evaluated for effects on embryonic spontaneous movement and heartbeat, larval light-dark transition response, and thigmotaxis. Although the modes-of-action are different, both pesticides proved to be moderately toxic to early life stages of zebrafish with 96 hr LC50 of approximately 6.5 mg/L and similar EC50 values of approximately 4 mg/L. Changes in behavioral endpoints were detected 24 hr of exposure, suggesting that behavioral measurements can serve as sensitive and early indicators of pesticide exposure. Changes in behavior, such as decrease in spontaneous coiling movements of embryos and reduction of thigmotaxis in larvae, were pronounced for diuron, indicating the usefulness of the application of behavioral endpoints to assess the effects of other herbicides. In the case of diazinon, the effects were less prominent, but the detected changes in ratios between activity in light and darkness also point to the possibility of using behavioral changes for evaluation of insecticide effects. The obtained results support the usage of behavioral endpoints in zebrafish embryos and larvae for the detection of early effects of pesticides."

The wing-spot test was performed with standard (ST) and high-bioactivation (HB) crosses after providing chronic 48 hr treatment to third instar larvae. A positive dose-response effect was observed in both crosses, but statistically reduced spot frequencies were registered for the HB cross compared with the ST. This latter finding suggests that metabolism differences play an important role in the genotoxic effect of diuron. To verify diuron's ability to produce DNA damage, a wing imaginal disk comet assay was performed after providing 24 hr diuron treatment to ST and HB third instar larvae. DNA damage induced by the herbicide had a significantly positive dose-response effect even at very low concentrations in both strains. However, as noted for the wing-spot test, a significant difference between strains was not observed that could be related to the duration of exposure between both assays. A positive correlation between the comet assay and the wing-spot test was found with regard to diuron genotoxicity."

The experimental system was the isolated perfused rat liver. The results demonstrate that diuron inhibited biosynthesis (gluconeogenesis) and ammonia detoxification, which are dependent of ATP generated within the mitochondria. Conversely, it stimulated glycolysis and fructolysis, which are compensatory phenomena for an inhibited mitochondrial ATP generation. Furthermore, diuron diminished the cellular ATP content under conditions where the mitochondrial respiratory chain was the only source of this compound. Besides the lack of circulating glucose due to gluconeogenesis inhibition, one can expect metabolic acidosis due to excess lactate production, impairment of ammonia detoxification and cell damage due to a deficient maintenance of its homeostasis. Some of the general signs of toxicity that were observed in diuron-treated rats can be attributed, partly at least, to the effects of the herbicide on energy metabolism."

The proposed rat urothelial mode of action (MOA) for this herbicide consists of metabolic activation to metabolites that are excreted and concentrated in the urine, leading to cytotoxicity, urothelial cell necrosis and exfoliation, regenerative hyperplasia, and eventually tumors. We show evidence for this MOA for diuron using the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) conceptual framework for evaluating an MOA for chemical carcinogens, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and IPCS framework for assessing human relevance."

            "Value": "In natural soils, soil organic matter was the main adsorbent of diuron, but the Koc was larger in sandy compared to clay soils(1). In a field study, diuron, injected at 30 cm into a silty loam soil (2% OM) on irrigated plots without a crop, was not detected at 50 and 150 cm after 2 years(2). The proportion of organic matter in soil directly influences the amount of adsorbed diuron(3). Diuron was subjected more to leaching in deeper soil because of the small amount of organic matter(3). Diuron sorption occurs in two distinct phases: a fast, initial one followed by a subsequent slow one(4). The sorption process is conceptualized as a rapid uptake process to readily available sorption sites followed by slow diffusion-immobilization in micropores and/or organic matter(4). The percent adsorption of diuron at 20 \u00b0C varied from 71-84% in 3 soils(5). Diuron had relatively low mobility compared with 24 other herbicides tested in soil thin layer and soil thick layer leaching tests and was put in class 2 of a five class mobility system where 5 was the most mobile(6). In laboratory column leaching studies in which diuron was applied to 60 cm soil cores and allowed to leach with 20 cm of water for 54 days, the diuron reached a 10 cm depth after the first 10 cm was applied but didn't leach further(7). In field experiments, surface applied diuron did not move below the upper 5 cm layer regardless of rate of application or water addition(7). In other field experiments no diuron leached below 10 cm under crop treatment conditions indicating that percolation is not a major factor(8) and in irrigated fields in Wyoming no diuron was found below 5 cm(9). Diuron showed very low mobility in Lakeland pond sediment under unsaturated flow conditions, remaining in the upper 5 cm after 30 days with 1.2 cm/day of water being applied(10)."
