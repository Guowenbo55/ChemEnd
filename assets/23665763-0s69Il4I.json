Preincubation of the various DNA synthesis assay components in 100 mM bisulfite showed that only preincubation of DNA polymerase I caused inhibition of DNA synthesis. There was a 7.5-fold decrease in the fidelity of DNA synthesis. It is hypothesized that sulfitolysis of the one disulfide group in DNA polymerase I by bisulfite might be responsible for reduced polymerase activity and accuracy. Effects of bisulfite on mutation frequency might be mediated by effects on the fidelity of DNA repair systems."
