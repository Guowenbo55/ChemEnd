    "Description": "Pentachloronitrobenzene is a C-nitro compound that is nitrobenzene in which every hydrogen has been replaced by a chlorine. A fungicide used on a variety of crops, including cotton, rice and seed grains, it is no longer approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a C-nitro compound, a member of pentachlorobenzenes and an aromatic fungicide.",
