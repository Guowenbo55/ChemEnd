    "Description": "Chlorsulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is N-carbamoyl-2-chlorobenzenesulfonamide in which one of the hydrogens attached to the non-sulfonylated nitrogen has been replaced by a 4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. A herbicide used for the control of broadleaf weeds in wheat, barley and oats. It has a role as an agrochemical, a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a methoxy-1,3,5-triazine.",

Following foliar treatment, 39% of the herbicide was absorbed, while absorption was 16% when it was added to a nutrient solution in which the plants were growing. Translocation of the herbicide within the plant was limited, with only 10% of the applied 14C moving out of the treated leaf and 10% moving from the roots to other parts of the plant when absorbed from the nutrient solution. Metabolism of chlorsulfuron was not observed in Canada thistle 48 hours after foliar treatment, but when absorbed by the roots from the nutrient solution, nearly 25% of the 14C in the plants was present as polar products, 13% had an Rf value matching benzenesulfonamide standards, and the remaining 62% remained as chlorsulfuron. The herbicide had suppressive effects on regrowth, reduced whole plant weight, and affected root bud number and weight.",

Although both species absorbed similar amounts of chlorsulfuron from the nutrient solution into the roots, tall fescue translocated more of the absorbed radioactivity to the shoots. Additionally, tall fescue metabolized chlorsulfuron in the shoots slightly more slowly than Kentucky bluegrass.
