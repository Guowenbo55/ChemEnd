While spinosad A has a logD of 2.0 at pH 4.9 suggesting some ability to move systemically, its large molecular weight of 732 g/mol for the spinosyn A component favors retention in plant tissues according to literature reviews. However, our research confirmed low levels of translocation to onion leaves, consistent with previous research documenting spinosad movement controlling foliar pests when applied to the base of tomato plants in a rockwool medium.",
