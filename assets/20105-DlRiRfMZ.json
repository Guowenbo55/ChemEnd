The translocation of 14C-label of dipropetryn to the shoots was low in corn as compared to oats. Prometryn 14C-label was more readily translocated to the tops of corn than dipropetryn and was more readily translocated in oats than corn. Dipropetryn 14C-label entered excised leaves through the transpiration stream during a short exposure period and translocated to a greater extent in oats than in corn. The 14C-label of dipropetryn became immobilized in excised leaves after about 4 h. The 14C-label of prometryn was initially more mobile in excised leaves of oats than corn. However, translocation of the 14C-label of prometryn continued in both species during 10 h of treatment and there was very little difference in the final distribution pattern. DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol) did not affect the distribution pattern of the 14C-label of dipropetryn or prometryn in corn after 10 h treatments.",
