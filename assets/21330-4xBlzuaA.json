    "Description": "Oxycarboxin is an anilide obtained by formal condensation of the amino group of aniline with the carboxy group of 2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-4,4-dioxo-1,4-oxathiine-3-carboxylic acid. A fungicide for the control of rust diseases on ornamentals, cereals and nursery trees as well as fairy rings on turf. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a sulfone, an anilide, an oxacycle, an organosulfur heterocyclic compound and an anilide fungicide.",

It was found that carboxin was taken up better by the roots of bean plants than oxycarboxin. Radioautography indicated apoplastic movement of both fungicides, leading to marginal accumulation in transpiring leaves, with no redistribution between organs up to 14 days after treatment cessation. Carboxin was rapidly oxidized in roots to the non-fungitoxic sulfoxide, while oxycarboxin persisted in root and leaf extracts for up to 21 days. The majority of the label in roots was acetone-insoluble, indicating binding to plant polymers, while in leaves, a smaller proportion was insoluble. Analysis showed that the carboxamide linkage in carboxin was hydrolyzed in roots, producing aniline, which bound to plant polymers and formed water-soluble conjugation products. These findings were confirmed by chemotherapy studies with bean rust, confirming the translocation, distribution, and decomposition patterns of the fungicides.",
