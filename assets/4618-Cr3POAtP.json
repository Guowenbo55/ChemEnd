One microorganism, Pseudomonas putida, cleaved the thioester bond to form 2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethanethiol, which was subsequently oxidized to bis(2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethyl)disulfide, and 2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethanethiol(1). Another microorganism, a Nocardia sp. produced bis(2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethyl)disulfide, bis[2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethyl]sulfide, and bis(2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethyl)sulfide via oxidation, beta-elimination, and hydrolysis(1)."

            "Value": "Organophosphorus insecticides exert their acute effects in both insects and mammals by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the nervous system with subsequent accumulation of toxic levels of acetylcholine (ACh), which is a neurotransmitter.  In many cases, the organophosphorylated enzyme is fairly stable, so that recovery from intoxication may be slow. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"
