    "Description": "Indole-3-acetic acid is a monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens has been replaced by a 1H-indol-3-yl group. It has a role as a plant hormone, a human metabolite, a plant metabolite, a mouse metabolite and an auxin. It is a monocarboxylic acid and a member of indole-3-acetic acids. It is a conjugate acid of an indole-3-acetate.",

Swelling of the root tips occurred during the inhibition period. Similar root responses were observed when IAA was applied to the cut stem surface above the mature leaves. IAA-1-14C applied through a cut stem surface or to mature leaves was translocated downwards in the plants, and labeled IAA could be isolated from the roots 3 to 24 hours after application. The ethanol-soluble activity of IAA decreased rapidly, indicating rapid metabolism or binding of IAA. IAA-1-14C applied to growing leaves was not translocated. The rapid response of root growth suggests that IAA is translocated into the roots at a rate of about 7 cm per hour, implicating the involvement of sieve tubes in translocation. The results have implications for the translocation of endogenous auxin into the roots.",
