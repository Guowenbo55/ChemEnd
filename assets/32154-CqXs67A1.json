    "Description": "Propyzamide is a member of the class of benzamides resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3,5-dichlorobenzoic acid with the amino group of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-amine. It is used as a systemic post-emergent herbicide for the control grass and broadleaf weeds in a wide range of in a wide variety of fruit and root crops. It has a role as a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a dichlorobenzene, a terminal acetylenic compound and a member of benzamides.",

The absorption, translocation. and metabolism of propyzamide was studied in seedlings of witloof chicory and common amaranth to determine if differences in these processes cause the differential sensitivity. At 24, 48, and 72 h after root treatment, there was no difference in the concentration of propyzamide in common amaranth and witloof chicory. Approximately 50% of the absorbed 14C was translocated out of the roots to shoots of both species at 24 and 48 h after treatment. After 72 h about 55 and 74% of the absorbed propyzamide was translocated to shoots of witloof chicory and common amaranth, respectively. Distribution of propyzamide in plant parts of witloof chicory and common amaranth seedlings was similar. Roots of both species accumulated the highest concentration of total propyzamide whereas shoots contained the lowest. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the herbicide was metabolized in neither species 48 h after treatment. No differences were found in absorption, translocation. or metabolism between witloof chicory and common amaranth with regard to propyzamide.",

For [14C]glyphosate and [14C]imazapyr applied post-emergence to sunflower, translocation within the host plant did not differ between parasitized and non-parasitized plants, with most radioactivity remaining in the treated leaf. Translocation of [14C]glyphosate to O. cumana reached 5.5% at 3 days after treatment (DAT). [14C]Imazapyr was absorbed more by the treated leaf than [14C]glyphosate at 1 DAT, with higher levels accumulated by O. cumana. Metabolism of [14C]imazapyr showed a constant presence in the treated leaf but a higher proportion of the parent compound in O. cumana, suggesting its control by this herbicide.",
