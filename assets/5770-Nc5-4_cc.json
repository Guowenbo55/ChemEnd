    "Description": "Reserpine is an alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a first generation antipsychotic, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a plant metabolite. It is an alkaloid ester, a methyl ester and a yohimban alkaloid. It is functionally related to a reserpic acid.",

The storage vesicles are rendered dysfunctional as a result of their interaction with reserpine, and nerve endings lose their ability to concentrate and store norepinephrine and dopamine. Catecholamines leak into the cytoplasm, where they are destroyed by intraneuronal monoamine oxidase, and little or no active transmitter is discharged from nerve endings when they are depolarized."

            "Value": "Reserpine induced depletion of biogenic amines correlates with evidence of sympathetic dysfunction and antihypertensive effects. Recovery of sympathetic function requires synthesis of new storage vesicles, which takes days to weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Since reserpine depletes amines in the CNS as well as in the peripheral adrenergic neuron, it is probable that its antihypertensive effects are related to both a central and a peripheral action; it is certain that many of the side effects of reserpine are related to its effects in the CNS."

            "Value": "A bioassay for possible carcinogenicity of reserpine ... was conducted by admin the test chemical in feed to F344 rats and B6C3Fl mice. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were administered reserpine at two doses, 5 ppm and 10 ppm, for 103 weeks and then observed for an additional 2 weeks. Matched controls consisted of groups of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving animals were /sacrificed/ and necropsied at the end of 104 or 105 wk. ... It was concluded that, under the conditions of the bioassay, reserpine was carcinogenic in male rats and in mice of both sexes, producing three different kinds of cancers. Reserpine was not carcinogenic for female rats, but they may not have received a high enough dose for maximum test sensitivity. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Positive; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Positive."

A few pituitary adenomas, fibroadenomas of the mammary gland and lymphosarcomas were found in both treated and control rats; however, the differences in incidence were not statistically significant."

            "Value": "Reserpine inhibits the pituitary ovarian axis in the rat, rabbit and guinea-pig. The studies in the rabbit showed interruption of pregnancy when doses of as little as 0.125 mg (0.04 mg/kg bw) were administered intramuscularly either early or late in gestation. When given at 14-15 days of gestation to guinea-pigs, reserpine caused death and resorption of fetuses. Pregnancy was interrupted in rats given 250 ug/kg bw per day subcutaneously starting on the 1 st, 3rd or 6th day of gestation."

Hydronephrosis and deformities of the brain ventricles were found when 1 mg/kg bw was injected to rats daily for 3 days in the last third of gestation. Doses up to 0.5 mg per day (0.16 mg/kg bw) injected intramuscularly during mid-gestation in rabbits caused no fetotoxicity."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc for reserpine can be estimated to be 2.70X10+6(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that reserpine is expected to be immobile in soil. The pKb of reserpine is 6.6(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts."
