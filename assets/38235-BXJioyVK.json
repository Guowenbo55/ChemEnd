This insecticide was readily taken up by the young seedlings and translocated to the cotyledons and developing leaves where it was rapidly metabolized to its sulfoxide (P1), 3,3-dimethyl-1-(methylsulfinyl)-2-butanone [(methylamino)carbonyl]oxime. The level of P1 declined in the cotton leaves with time, resulting in the formation of the sulfone (P2), 3,3-dimethyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)-2-butanone [(methylamino)carbonyl]oxime, and water-soluble metabolites. Cottonseeds from laboratory and field plants grown from thiofanox-treated seeds contained less than 5 ppb of carbamate residues.",

After 4 weeks, the seedlings were thinned to one per pot. The plants were grown in an environmental growth chamber with 14-hour 30\u00b0C day and 10-hour 21\u00b0C night temperatures under a mixture of fluorescent and incandescent lamps yielding 43,200 lx at the top of the plants.",
