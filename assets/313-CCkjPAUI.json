            "Value": "The biological activity of hydrogen chloride is associated with its high solubility in water i.e., 23 moles/L at 0 \u00b0C. ... The hydrogen chloride in water dissociates almost completely, with the hydrogen ion captured by the water molecules to form the hydronium ion. The hydronium ion becomes a donor of a proton that possesses catalytic properties and thus is capable of reacting with organic molecules. This may explain the ability of hydrogen chloride to induce cellular injury and necrosis."

This study examined the roles of vascular dysfunction and inflammation to the esophageal injury response to different caustic substances in mice. The esophageal responses to sodium hydroxide (10%, 5%, and 2.5%), potassium hydroxide (10%, 5%, and 2.5%), sodium hypochlorite (5.25%), and hydrochloric acid (10%, pH 2) were evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology. Intravital microscopy was used to monitor changes in the diameter of arterioles and venules, the adhesion and movement of leukocytes in venules, and the time of cessation of arteriolar blood flow in mouse esophagus. The esophageal mucosa was exposed to caustic substances for 0 to 60 minutes before evaluation. The higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide elicited rapid stasis in both arterioles and venules, which was accompanied by arteriolar constriction and thrombosis. An accumulation of adherent leukocytes in venules was not observed with any agent. Histopathological evaluation revealed marked cellular and interstitial edema in the mucosa with alkali, whereas hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite decreased the thickness epithelial layer. These findings suggest that ischemia and thrombosis are dominant processes, whereas inflammation is less important in the pathogenesis of acute corrosive injury to the esophageal mucosa."

Here we develop a translational mouse model of ALI, which not only reflects the major clinical and pathological features but also enables investigation into ALI resolution. Anaesthetized mice underwent orotracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid. During the immediate period after instillation, mice were carefully maintained with supplemental oxygen to avoid mortality. At specified time-points, lung injury was assessed by analysis of blood gases, respiratory mechanics, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, alveolar fluid clearance and lung histology. Animals exhibited significant weight loss, decreased oxygenation, increased respiratory elastance and pulmonary inflammation (intra-alveolar leukocyte influx/cytokine levels and histological injury scores). Moreover, mice displayed alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction/epithelial injury as reflected by increased alveolar protein, lung wet/dry weight ratio and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products, as well as reduced alveolar fluid clearance. These injury parameters peaked between days 1 and 3, followed by almost complete recovery over days 5-10. Histology showed evidence of fibrosis on day 10. The results indicate that this resolving model of acid aspiration represents a powerful experimental tool to investigate the injurious, inflammatory, fibrotic, and resolving and reparative processes of ALI."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Acid aspiration is a major cause of acute lung injury. However, the mechanisms that underlie this spatial expansion of the injury remain undefined. In current animal models of acid injury, intratracheal acid instillation replicates the lung injury. However intratracheal instillation causes a global effect, precluding studies of how the injury spreads. Here, we report an airway catheter-based method for localized acid delivery in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung. We co-instilled hydrochloric acid with evans blue through the catheter into one lung and determined blood-free extravascular lung water in tissue samples from regions that either received, or did not receive the instilled acid. Tissue samples from the noncatheterized contralateral lung were used as controls. Lung water increased both in the regions that received acid, as well as in adjacent regions that did not. Pretreating the lung with vascular infusions of the gap junctional blocker, glycerrhetinic acid, blunted the acid-induced lung water increase at the adjacent regions. These findings indicate that endothelial gap junction communication causes spread of lung injury from regions that were directly acid injured, to adjacent sites that did not directly receive acid. /This/ new method for establishing localized acid injury provides evidence for a novel role for vascular gap junctions in the spatial expansion of acid injury."

The aim of this study was to determine the role and signaling mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in experimental ALI from HCl aspiration using a combination of genetic animal models and pharmacologic inhibition strategies. To this end, HCl was instilled intratracheally to mice, followed by respiratory system elastance measurement, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue harvesting 24 hr after injection.Hydrochloric acid instillation induced an inflammatory response in the lungs of wild-type mice, evidenced as increased bronchoalveolar lavage total cells, neutrophils, and total protein; histologic lung injury score; and respiratory system elastance, whereas TNF-alpha receptor I mRNA levels were maintained. These alterations could be prevented by pretreatment with etanercept or genetic deletion of the 55-kd TNF-alpha receptor I, but not by deletion of the TNF-alpha gene. Hydrochloric acid induced a 6-fold increase in apoptotic, caspase 3-positive cells in lung sections from wild-type mice, which was abrogated in mice lacking TNF-alpha receptor I. In immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry studies, HCl stimulated signaling via p44/42 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which was blocked in TNF-alpha receptor I knockout mice. In conclusion, ALI induced by HCl requires TNF-alpha receptor I function and associates with activation of downstream proinflammatory signaling pathways p44/42 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase."

The authors hypothesized that spontaneous breathing (SB) with biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) would attenuate lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with pressure-controlled ventilation. Twenty male New Zealand white rabbits with hydrochloric acid aspiration-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome were randomly ventilated using the BIPAP either with SB (BIPAP plus SB group) or without SB (BIPAP minus SB group) for 5 hr. Inspiration pressure was adjusted to maintain the tidal volume at 6 mL/kg. Both groups received the same positive end-expiratory pressure level at 5 cm H2O for hemodynamic goals. Eight healthy animals without ventilatory support served as the control group. The BIPAP plus SB group presented a lower ratio of dead space ventilation to tidal volume, a lower respiratory rate, and lower minute ventilation. No significant difference in the protein levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue were measured between the two experimental groups. However, SB resulted in lower messenger ribonucleic acid levels of interleukin-6 (mean +/- SD; 1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.5; P = 0.008) and interleukin-8 (2.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6; P = 0.014) in lung tissues.

However, because HCl is not an oxidant per se, the exact mechanism by which the acid induces lipid peroxidation is unknown. We hypothesized that gastric acid may disrupt mitochondrial transmembrane potential and induce the production of superoxide in mitochondria, which subsequently may induce lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells. Firstly we treated gastric epithelial RGM1 cells with solutions containing various concentrations of HCl (i.e., of varying pH), and examined cellular injury, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis with specific fluorescent dyes. Secondly, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of isolated, acid-exposed mitochondria from the cells, using a spin-trapping reagent for superoxide, 5-(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propoxy cyclophosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (CYPMPO). Finally, we established novel RGM1 cells that overexpressed manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which removes superoxide from mitochondria, and examined the effect of acid treatment on cellular membrane lipid peroxidation. The results indicated that the exposure to acid indeed induced cellular injury, cellular lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, and the demonstration of the exact superoxide spectra on EPR spectroscopy in gastric epithelial cells, and that overexpression of MnSOD decreased superoxide production and prevented cellular lipid peroxidation. These results suggested that gastric acid, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), induces mitochondrial superoxide production, which induces gastric cellular injury by triggering cellular lipid peroxidation and apoptosis."

The muscarinic and purinergic receptors in rat tissue were measured by radioreceptor assays using (N-methyl-(3)H) scopolamine methyl chloride ([(3)H]NMS) and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (2,8-3H) tetrasodium salt ([(3)H] alpha,beta -MeATP), respectively. The urodynamic parameters and ATP levels were measured using a cystometric method and the luciferin-luciferase assay, respectively.

Laryngospasm was associated with prolonged apnea and total cessation of diaphragmatic EMG activity in 1 animal, and in another, initial tachypnea was followed by erratic diaphragmatic activity and brief apnea. Laryngeal acid exposure (below pH 2.0) causes laryngospasm and may result in paradoxical apneic events in neonatal dogs.
