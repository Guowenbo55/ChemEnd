In a municipal wastewater plant, 97% of 1,1-dichloroethylene was reported to be removed(3). 1,1-Dichloroethylene at a concentration of 160 ug/L was degraded using continuous mixed, batch-fed reactors at a 20-day operating solids retention time(4). 1,1-Dichloroethylene had a biodegradation half-life of 1.25 yrs in ground water from a former manufacturing facility in New Jersey(5). 1,1-Dichloroethylene had a biodegradation rate of 0.050 ug/g soil/hour in soil from Skellingsted landfill in Holback, Denmark, incubated with methane(6)."

In another anaerobic biodegradation study that used materials from an aquifer that receive municipal landfill leachate and is known to support methanogenesis, 1,1-dichloroethylene disappeared in 40 weeks(3). However, no significant degradation occurred for 16 weeks(3). An effluent concentration of 2 ug/L was measured using continuous mixed, batch-fed reactors at a 53-day operating solids retention time with 1,1-dichloroethylene influent at a concentration of 120 ug/L(4). 1,1-Dichloroethylene had a anaerobic rate coefficient of 0.0040-0.0086/day(5)."
