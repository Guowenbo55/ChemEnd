Beauv. \u266f3 ECHCG]. Oxadiazon produced only brown spots on the foliage of rice plants at higher rates (> 500 ppmv), while LC50 for barnyardgrass was 250 ppmv. Translocation of 14C-oxadiazon from the treated leaf was minimal in both species; after 7 days, about 2 and 3% of applied 14 C translocated in rice and barnyardgrass, respectively. In rice, 14C recovered in water and chloroform washings of the treated leaf was 25% in each and in barnyardgrass, 20 and 18%, respectively. After water and chloroform washings, 14C-oxadiazon present in the treated leaf of barnyardgrass and rice was 36 and 26%, respectively. In rice and barnyardgrass, unaltered 14C-oxadiazon represented 86 and 79% of applied 14C, respectively, 7 days after application. In barnyardgrass 7 days after foliar application, oxadiazon inhibited 14CO2 fixation and the export of fixed carbon. The effects were less marked in rice.",

Three types of HC-labeled oxadiazon were used, and 14C-labeled oxadiazon was applied to soil under submerged conditions. Oxadiazon was found to be translocated significantly to shoots and accumulated in the lower leaves and stems, with a small portion also reaching the head parts of the plant. Chemical transformation in the plants resulted in the production of dealkylated compounds, oxidized alcohol, and carboxylic acid as metabolites. Two unidentified metabolites were also detected, with one being translocated to head parts from leaves and stems. The translocation and accumulation of oxadiazon and its metabolites were discussed in relation to the physiological conditions of rice plants.",
