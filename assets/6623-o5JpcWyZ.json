Using the OECD biodegradation screening test with domestic sewage as seed, <1% degradation was observed in 28 days(1). Bisphenol A was not oxidized in either the Closed Bottle Test nor the Modified Sturm Test; these results indicate a possible lack of acclimation by a domestic sludge as the compound was degraded in biotreators of chemical plants where the compound was produced or used(1). Incubation of 105 mg/L bisphenol A in an acclimated activated sludge inocula from an industrial wastewater treatment plant resulted in 72% COD removal in 24 hours(2). Bisphenol A, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its Theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(3). Of 40 Japanese river microcosms and 3 activated sludge samples tested, only 6 could completely mineralize bisphenol A, resulting in 2 common metabolites: 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol and p-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol; 19 bacteria were isolated from these activated sludge and river water samples(4). Further testing with the pure cultures suggested that bisphenol A-degrading bacteria exist in aquatic environments but they are unable to completely degrade bisphenol A, leading to accumulation of more recalcitrant metabolites(4). In 22-day aerobic river die-away tests using several river water samples in 24 microcosms, bisphenol A showed complete degradation in 19 microcosms (complete mineralization in two microcosms) and no degradation in 5 microcosms(5). The degradation rate and half-life of bisphenol A in sediment were reported as 0.63/day and 1.1 days, respectively(6)."

In the OECD 301D closed bottle test and OECD 301B modified Sturm test no biodegradation was observed.

From the biodegradation studies reported bisphenol A would appear to be readily biodegradable, possibly with a short period of adaptation. In natural water, removal appears to be rapid once the waters have become acclimatized to bisphenol A; the reported lag-phases before degradation are between 3-8 days(1). After the lag phase removal was rapid with 50% removal in 1-2 days and 100% removal in 2 to 17 days. These data would appear to indicate that in natural waters bisphenol A may be classed as readily biodegradable meeting the 10-day test window(1)."

Human ESF from eight hysterectomy specimens were cultured and treated with 5-100 umol/L of BPA + or - estradiol or 8-br-cAMP for 48 hr. mRNA expression was analysed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. 8-br-cAMP-induced human ESF decidualization was confirmed by expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin secretion. Short-term exposure (48 hr) decreased human ESF proliferation (P<0.04) not due to apoptosis. High doses of BPA significantly induced IGFBP1 mRNA and protein, decreased P450scc mRNA, reversed the 8-br-cAMP-induced increase in HSD17B2 (estradiol to estrone conversion) in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated HSD17B1 expression (oestrone to estradiol conversion; P = 0.03). 8-br-cAMP significantly potentiated this effect (P=0.028). BPA had no significant effect on aromatase and PPAR gamma expression. The estrogen-receptor antagonist ICI had no effect on gene expression in BPA-treated cells, and estrogen receptor a, but not estrogen receptor beta, was significantly down-regulated by high doses of BPA (P=0.028). BPA has an endocrine-disrupting effect on human ESF function and gene expression but the underlying mechanisms appear not to involve estrogen-mediated pathways."

At puberty, animals exposed prenatally to BPA showed an increased proliferation/apoptosis ratio in both the epithelial and stromal compartments. During adulthood (PND110 and PND180), BPA-exposed animals showed an increased number of hyperplastic ducts and augmented stromal nuclear density. Moreover, the stroma associated with hyperplastic ducts showed signs of desmoplasia and contained an increased number of mast cells, suggesting a heightened risk of neoplastic transformation. Administration of a subcarcinogenic dose of NMU to animals exposed prenatally to BPA increased the percentage of hyperplastic ducts and induced the development of neoplastic lesions. The results demonstrate that the prenatal exposure to low doses of BPA perturbs mammary gland histoarchitecture and increases the carcinogenic susceptibility to a chemical challenge administered 50 days after the end of BPA exposure."

A National Toxicology Program carcinogenesis bioassay of BP-A (>98% pure) was conducted by feeding diets containing 0, 1000, or 2000 ppm BP-A to groups of 50 male and 50 female Fischer (F)344 rats; 0, 1000, or 5000 ppm to groups of 50 male B6C3F1 mice; and 0, 5000, or 10,000 ppm to groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice for 103 weeks. The mean body weights of the low- and high-dose rats and of female mice and high-dose male mice were lower than those of the controls throughout much of the study. Lower body weight gains in rats were likely caused by reduced food consumption. Survivals were comparable among groups. Regarding neoplasia, leukemias occurred at increased incidences in BP-A-dosed rats of both sexes: male, 13/50 controls vs 12/50 low-dose and 23/50 high-dose (P < 0.03); in females, the respective findings were 7/50, 13/50, and 12/50. Interstitial-cell tumors of the testes were increased in BP-A-dosed male rats: 35/49 controls vs 48/50 (P < 0.01) and 46/49 (P < 0.01); and an increasing trend was observed for mammary gland fibroadenomas in male rats (P < 0.05, 0/50 controls vs 0/50 and 4/50). In male mice, lymphomas/leukemias were increased: 2/49 controls vs 9/50 (P < 0.05) and 5/50. Multinucleated giant hepatocytes were observed in male mice (1/49 controls vs 41/49 and 41/50), whereas there was no increase of liver tumors. In their BP-A bioassay report, the National Toxicology Program concluded that there was no convincing evidence that BP-A was carcinogenic for rats or mice. However, the marginal increases in leukemias in male and female rats, along with increases in the combined incidence of lymphomas and leukemias in male mice, suggest that BP-A may be associated with increased cancers of the hematopoietic system. Increases in interstitial-cell tumors of the testes in rats were also evidence of carcinogenesis, as was the unusual occurrence of mammary gland fibroadenomas in male rats."

Only low doses of BPA significantly decreased tumor latency and increased tumor multiplicity, tumor burden, and the incidence of metastasis. All BPA doses significantly increased the cell proliferation index, but only the higher doses also increased the apoptotic index in the mammary gland. At the molecular level, 25 ug BPA/L, but not 2,500 ug BPA/L, increased phosphorylation of erbB2, erbB3, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and Akt in the mammary gland.

Offspring weanling males were given untreated drinking water and maintained until 90 days of age when evaluations were made of various reproductive organs. ... The female offspring were not evaluated. No treatment-related effects on growth or reproductive endpoints were observed in adult females exposed to any concentration of BPA. Similarly, no treatment-related effects were observed on the growth, survival, or reproductive parameters (including testes, prostate and preputial gland weights, sperm count, daily sperm production, or testes histopathology) of male offspring from dams exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation. DES administered in the drinking water at 0.1 ppm resulted in decreased body weight, body weight change, and food consumption in adult females. In addition, an increase in the duration of gestation and a decrease in the number of pups delivered and number of live pups were also observed in animals exposed to DES."

The BPA was 97% pure, with no evidence of contamination by other phenolic compounds. Perinatal exposure to BPA leads to a dose-dependent decline in the reproductive capacity of female mice.

Heritable effects of an endocrine-disrupting chemical have implications for complex neurological diseases and highlight the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex disease."

In order to evaluate the effects of perinatal BPA treatment on learning and affect in adulthood, /the researchers/ exposed rats to one of five doses of BPA through gestation and lactation then examined adult behavior in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). No effect of BPA was observed in the MWM, but on both the EPM and FST, low doses (5 ug/kg) of BPA eliminated sex differences found between controls; furthermore, a non-monotonic dose-response observed in previous studies was confirmed for these tasks.

Here, using neural tissue obtained from the same animals, /the investigators/ explored the impact of neonatal BPA exposure on the development of sexually dimorphic hypothalamic regions critical for female reproductive physiology and behavior. Endpoints included quantification of oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons (OT-ir) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), serotonin (5-HT-ir) fiber density in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial nucleus (VMNvl) as well as ERa-ir neuron number in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the VMNvl, and the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Both doses of BPA increased the number of OT-ir neurons within the PVN, but no significant effects were seen on 5-HT-ir fiber density or ERa-ir neuron number in any of the areas analyzed. In addition to hypothalamic development, we also assessed female sex behavior and body weight. No effect of BPA on sexual receptivity or proceptive behavior in females was observed. Females treated with BPA, however, weighed significantly more than control females by postnatal day 99. This effect of BPA on weight is critical because alterations in metabolism, are frequently associated with reproductive dysfunction. Collectively, the results of this and our prior study indicate that the impact of neonatal BPA exposure within the female rat hypothalamus is region specific and support the hypothesis that developmental BPA exposure may adversely affect reproductive development in females."

We also examined the repetitive and social interaction behaviors in these flies. In an open field assay, we identified disturbances in the locomotion patterns of BPA-exposed Drosophila that may relate to the decision-making and the motivational state of the animal. An increase in repetitive behavior was observed as an increase in the grooming behavior of Drosophila following BPA exposure. Furthermore, we also observed abnormal social interaction by the BPA-exposed flies in a social setting.

In the present study, to assess whether endocrine disruptors (EDs) are involved in cellular functions through LPA signaling, we measured cell motile activity and LPA receptor expressions in WB-F344 cells treated with bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP).

Additionally, BPA up-regulates Cdk4, Ccne1, and Trp53 expression, whereas it down-regulates Ccnd2 expression. BPA also up-regulates Bax and Bcl2 expression while inducing atresia in antral follicles.

It has been further shown that both nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) are recruited to the TR-beta1 by BPA in the presence of physiologic concentrations of T3 or T4. However, the overexpression of beta3 integrin or c-Src significantly reduces BPA-induced recruitment of N-CoR/SMRT to TR or suppression of TR transcription. Furthermore, BPA inhibits the T3/T4-mediated interassociation of the beta3 integrin/c-Src/MAPK/TR-beta1 pathways by the co-immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that low concentrations of BPA suppress the TR transcription by disrupting physiologic concentrations of T3/T4-mediated beta3 integrin/c-Src/MAPK/TR-beta1 pathways, followed by recruiting N-CoR/SMRT to TR-beta1, providing a novel insight regarding the TH disruption effects of low concentration BPA."

This study was designed to evaluate how BPA regulates Sertoli cell (SC) signal molecules. Purified rat SCs were cultured and treated with BPA (200 umol/L) at various time points. Western blot analysis was used to determine the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), cyclooxygenase-1,2 (COX-1, 2), estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a), and androgen receptor (AR). The levels of transferrin (TF), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and prostaglandin F(2a) (PGF(2a)) in culture medium were quantified by ELISA. Interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 mRNAs were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Compared with the control, BPA activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) through 30 min to 6 hr. TF was down-regulated at 6 and 24 hr. Furthermore, IL-1beta was up-regulated at 30 min and IL-6 was up-regulated at 1 and 24 hr. ERK activity inhibitor (PD98059, 10 umol/L) inhibited these molecular changes. These results reveal the possibility that BPA may have adverse effects on spermatogenesis via ERK1/2."

Thymuses and bursae of Fabricius were collected on ED22. The microscopic examination of tissue structure and ultrastructure was carried out for histopathological changes of thymus and the bursa of Fabricius morphology under light and scanning electron microscopes (SEM). In the BPA group, the weight index of the bursae of Fabricius was significantly reduced (p < 0.01); the number of lymphatic follicles in the bursae of Fabricius was remarkably decreased (p < 0.01); and the thickness of the thymus cortex and medulla was reduced (p < 0.01). Light microscope and SEM examinations further showed that the lymphatic follicles and epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius and thymus were damaged by BPA. Our study confirms a direct toxicity of BPA at a very low-dose level on the development of the central immune organs of SPF chick embryos."

Analysis of concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated splenic mononuclear cells by ELISA demonstrated that BPA-fed C57BL/6 males produced, on average, 40% less interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; p < 0.01) and C57BL/6 females 28% less IFN-gamma (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Treated female NZB/NZW mice were monitored for lupus disease symptoms, defined as proteinuria (> 100 mg/dL albumin in urine for 2 consecutive weeks). Before the development of proteinuria, BPA-fed NZB/NZW mice produced significantly less ConA-stimulated IFN-gamma than did controls and displayed an average reduction of 50% in immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated splenocytes (p < 0.05). It is striking that 5-week-old female NZB/NZW mice fed a 7-day low-dose course of BPA developed proteinuria an average of 7 weeks later than did controls. Once proteinuria developed, splenocytes were stimulated with ConA for cytokine analysis. The BPA-fed mice showed a dramatic reduction of 64% in IFN-gamma production and a 32% reduction in ConA-stimulated interleukin-10 (p < 0.05). The long-lasting effects of BPA on IFN-gamma and IgG2a production likely contributed to the increased symptom-free period of the NZB/NZW mice."

There is a growing public concern that BPA exposure may pose a significant threat to human health. Moreover, due to the widespread and constant nature of BPA exposure, not only adults but fetuses and neonates are also exposed to BPA. There is mounting evidence that developmental exposures to chemicals from our environment, including BPA, contribute to diseases late in life; yet, studies of how early life exposures specifically alter the immune system are limited. Herein /the researchers/ report an examination of how maternal exposure to a low, environmentally relevant dose of BPA affects the immune response to infection with influenza A virus. /The researchers/ exposed female mice during pregnancy and through lactation to the oral reference dose for BPA listed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, and comprehensively examined immune parameters directly linked to disease outcomes in adult offspring following infection with influenza A virus. /The researchers/ found that developmental exposure to BPA did not compromise disease-specific adaptive immunity against virus infection, or reduce the host's ability to clear the virus from the infected lung. However, maternal exposure to BPA transiently reduced the extent of infection-associated pulmonary inflammation and anti-viral gene expression in lung tissue. From these observations, /the researchers/ conclude that maternal exposure to BPA slightly modulates innate immunity in adult offspring, but does not impair the anti-viral adaptive immune response, which is critical for virus clearance and survival following influenza virus infection."

Pyometra did not occur in CD1 mice exposed to different dietary doses of BPA ranging from 4.1 to >4000 ug/kg-day or 17a-ethinyl estradiol (EE; 1.2 to >150 ug/kg-day). In the C57BL/6 strain, pyometra occurred in the 15 ug/kg-day EE and 33 ug/kg-d BPA treatment groups. At the effective concentration of BPA, histological analysis revealed pathological alterations of uterine morphology associated with a >5.3-fold increase in macrophage numbers in non-pyometra uteri of C57BL/6 mice exposed to BPA. These results suggest that BPA enhances immune responsiveness of the uterus and that heightened responsiveness in C57BL/6 females is related to increased susceptibility to pyometra."

Here we present novel methodology to combine genomic DNA enrichment with RepeatMasker analysis on next-generation sequencing data to determine the effect of perinatal BPA exposure on repetitive DNA at the class, family, subfamily, and individual insertion level in both mouse and human samples. Mice were treated during gestation and lactation to BPA in chow at 0, 50, or 50,000 ng/g levels and total BPA was measured in stratified human fetal liver tissue samples as low (non-detect to 0.83 ng/g), medium (3.5 to 5.79 ng/g), or high (35.44 to 96.76 ng/g). Transposon methylation changes were evident in human classes, families, and subfamilies, with the medium group exhibiting hypomethylation compared to both high and low BPA groups. Mouse repeat classes, families, and subfamilies did not respond to BPA with significantly detectable differential DNA methylation. In human samples, 1251 individual transposon loci were detected as differentially methylated by BPA exposure, but only 19 were detected in mice. Of note, this approach recapitulated the discovery of a previously known mouse environmentally labile metastable epiallele, Cabp(IAP). Thus, by querying repetitive DNA in both mouse and humans, we report the first known transposons in humans that respond to perinatal BPA exposure."

Our findings demonstrate BPA and DES induce HOTAIR expression in cultured human breast cancer cells (MCF7) as well as in vivo in the mammary glands of rat. Luciferase assay showed that HOTAIR promoter estrogen-response-elements (EREs) are induced by BPA and DES. Estrogen-receptors (ERs) and ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases (MLL1 and MLL3) bind to the HOTAIR promoter EREs in the presence of BPA and DES, modify chromatin (histone methylation and acetylation) and lead to gene activation. Knockdown of ERs down-regulated the BPA and DES-induced expression of HOTAIR.

Recently, bisphenol-A has been associated with low-grade albuminuria in adults as well as in children. Since glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) are commonly affected in proteinuric conditions, herein we explored the effects of bisphenol-A on podocytes in vitro and in vivo. On cultured podocytes we first observed that bisphenol-A-at low or high concentrations-(10 nM and 100 nM, respectively) was able to induce hypertrophy, diminish viability, and promote apoptosis. We also found an increase in the protein expression of TGF-beta1 and its receptor, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, as well as collagen-IV, while observing a diminished expression of the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin. Furthermore, mice intraperitoneally injected with bisphenol-A (50 mg/kg for 5 weeks) displayed an increase in urinary albumin excretion and endogenous creatinine clearance. Renal histology showed mesangial expansion. At ultrastructural level, podocytes displayed an enlargement of both cytoplasm and foot processes as well as the presence of condensed chromatin, suggesting apoptosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for WT-1 (specific podocyte marker) and the TUNEL technique showed podocytopenia as well as the presence of apoptosis, respectively. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Bisphenol-A exposure promotes a podocytopathy with proteinuria, glomerular hyperfiltration and podocytopenia. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential role of bisphenol-A in the pathogenesis as well as in the progression of renal diseases."

We employed the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to test the effects of raising them on food containing various concentrations of BPA. Of note, raising males on food containing BPA were susceptible to starvation, possibly by inhibiting their ability to perform lipolysis during starvation, leading to significantly increased lipid content after 24 hr of fasting. Furthermore, feeding males with BPA significantly inhibited the expression of insulin-like peptides. From these results, we conclude that BPA may inhibit lipid recruitment during starvation in Drosophila."
