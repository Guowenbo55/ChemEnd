It has a role as an antifeedant, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a TRPV channel modulator. It is a member of 1,2,4-triazines and a member of pyridines.",

The results showed that both spirotetramat and pymetrozine had high bioconcentration in lettuce roots, with root concentration factor (RCF) values exceeding 1 after 24 hours of exposure. Pymetrozine exhibited higher translocation from roots to shoots compared to spirotetramat. Pymetrozine was primarily absorbed in roots via the symplastic pathway and stored in the soluble fraction of lettuce root and shoot cells. Spirotetramat and its metabolites showed major enrichments in the cell wall and soluble fractions of root cells. In lettuce shoot cells, spirotetramat and B-enol were mainly enriched in the soluble fraction, while B-keto and B-glu accumulated in cell walls and organelles, respectively. Both symplastic and apoplastic pathways were involved in spirotetramat absorption. The uptake of pymetrozine and spirotetramat by lettuce roots was passive, with no aquaporin-mediated dissimilation or diffusion. These findings improve our understanding of the transfer of these pesticides and their metabolites from the environment to lettuce, as well as their subsequent bioaccumulation. The study suggests a new approach for efficient lettuce pest control using spirotetramat and pymetrozine, while also highlighting the importance of evaluating the food safety and environmental risks associated with these compounds and their metabolites.",
