The degradation of 1-naphthol was determined in unsterile and sterile flood soil when carbaryl was injected into the water layer of flooded Beaumont clay soil and incubated at 28 \u00b0C under laboratory illumination(1). Following a 96-hr incubation period, measurable quantities of carbaryl's metabolite, 1-naphthol were detected in soil but only trace quantities were recovered from nonautoclaved samples. 1-Naphthol was not detected in the water layer of either autoclaved or nonautoclaved samples. The reduction of 1-naphthol concentration in bench-scale activated sludge treatment systems handling carbaryl manufacturing wastewater exceeded 90%(6). The mechanism for the reduction of carbaryl was postulated to be hydrolysis and biodegradation(6)."

As a result, pseudo first order rate constants were obtained using sequential amendments where new substrate was added after the last amendment was nondetectable. The lag period ranged from 2 to 8 days and the time for complete transformation of 1-naphthol ranged from 1 to 13 days. The transformation of 1-naphthol added in succeeding amendments generally followed a shorter lag (1-2 days), but the time over which the transformation occurred was again variable ranging from 1 to 16 days. Pseudo first-order rate constants determined for the second and third substrate amendments were 0.004 to 0.386 per hour and those from the initial amendment were 0.006 to 0.026 per hour(1)."

            "Value": "The mechanism(s) of toxicity of 1-naphthol and two of its possible metabolites, 1,2- and 1,4-naphthoquinone, to freshly isolated rat hepatocytes has been studied. 1-Naphthol and both naphthoquinones exhibited a dose-dependent toxicity to hepatocytes. [1-14C]-1-Naphthol was metabolised by hepatocytes predominantly to its glucuronic acid and sulphate ester conjugates, but small amounts of covalently bound products were also formed. Blebbing on the surface of the hepatocytes was observed following exposure to 1-naphthol and the naphthoquinones, together with a dose-dependent decrease in intracellular glutathione (GSH), which preceded the onset of cytotoxicity. The toxicity of 1-naphthol and the naphthoquinones was potentiated by dicoumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase). This enhanced toxicity was accompanied by a greater amount of surface blebbing, an increased depletion of intracellular GSH, particularly in the case of 1-naphthol and 1,4-naphthoquinone, and a decreased metabolism of 1-naphthol to its conjugates with variable effects on the amount of covalently bound products formed. These results support the suggestion that the toxicity of 1-naphthol may be mediated by the formation of 1,2-naphthoquinone and/or 1,4-naphthoquinone, which may then be metabolised by one electron reduction to naphthosemiquinone radicals. These, in turn, may covalently bind to important cellular macromolecules or enter a redox cycle with molecular oxygen thereby generating active oxygen species. Both of these processes appear to play a role in producing the cytotoxic effects of 1-naphthol."

The study found that marigold exhibited the ability to take up carbaryl and its degradation product, 1-naphthol, through its roots, accumulate them within the root system, and subsequently translocate these compounds for further accumulation in its shoots. This systemic behavior of marigold in accumulating 1-naphthol is significant in the context of phytoremediation, as it demonstrated the plant's potential to effectively remove carbaryl from contaminated soil. The research also noted that marigold exhibited fewer toxicity symptoms when exposed to carbaryl, indicating its capacity to tolerate the pesticide. Marigold had the highest bioconcentration factor (BCF) among the studied plants, with a value of 1848, indicating its hyperaccumulation ability for carbaryl removal. Furthermore, marigold had the highest translocation factor (TF), suggesting its ability to uptake and translocate carbaryl, especially 1-naphthol, which had accumulated in the shoots. ",
