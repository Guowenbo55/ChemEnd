According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,4,6-collidine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC). The pKa of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is 7.4(4), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(5)."
