A 0% removal (based on chemical oxygen demand) was measured in a batch system using activated sludge and a 5-day incubation period(4). Biological degradation in an electrolytic respirometer using activated sludge was in excess of 10 days(5). 2-Nitroaniline was not biodegradable in an electrolytic respirometer study, although 4-nitroaniline was found to be biodegradable using the same test conditions(6). Aerobic incubation of 2-nitroaniline in a rotary shaker using sewage inocula for 52 days resulted in a maximum loss of 15% as measured by UV absorbance loss(7). A 20-day study using uniformly ring-labeled 2-nitroaniline had a 14-carbon dioxide evolution of 1.9%, measured from laboratory flask system containing a silt loam soil media(8); 14-carbon dioxide evolution was less than 0.3% from the same soil system which had been sterilized with sodium azide(8). 2-Nitroaniline had a biodegradation rate of 0.023/hr in river water giving a half-life of 31 hours, which was classified as poor degradation(9).

Marginal reduction in food consumption (94% of control) was reported for 100 mg/kg dams that was only statistically significant in the overall time period of day 6 to 21 of gestation but not significant at any other time interval. In contrast 300 mg/kg-dams showed statistically significant reduction in food consumption on days 6-10 of gestation as well as for the day 6-21 period. Only the high-dose group of dams showed a reduction in food consumption (87% of control) that appeared biologically significant. Body weight gains were 94, 88 and 85% of controls for low, mid and high-dose dams, respectively. Both mid and high-dose dams lost body weight between gestation day 6 and 10; however, the statistical analysis of body weights only showed significant differences for the high-dose group. Since there was a slight loss of body weight in the mid-dose group between gd 6 and 10; this is considered an indication of maternal toxicity and the maternal LOAEL is considered to be 300 mg/kg with a Maternal NOAEL of 100 mg/kg. This is supported by the clinical observations where mid and high-dose dams were reported to demonstrate piloerection while low-dose dams did not. No effects on pregnancy rates, mean of live and dead pups, resorptions, nidations, c lutea. Fetal NOAEL considered to be 600 mg/kg.
