The translocation of 14C-label of dipropetryn to the shoots was low in corn as compared to oats. Prometryn 14C-label was more readily translocated to the tops of corn than dipropetryn and was more readily translocated in oats than corn. Dipropetryn 14C-label entered excised leaves through the transpiration stream during a short exposure period and translocated to a greater extent in oats than in corn. The 14C-label of dipropetryn became immobilized in excised leaves after about 4 h. The 14C-label of prometryn was initially more mobile in excised leaves of oats than corn. However, translocation of the 14C-label of prometryn continued in both species during 10 h of treatment and there was very little difference in the final distribution pattern. DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol) did not affect the distribution pattern of the 14C-label of dipropetryn or prometryn in corn after 10 h treatments.",

Studies on prometryn absorption, translocation to photosynthetic tissue or lysigenous glands, and metabolism showed that the tolerance differences could not be explained by differences in these factors. Despite greater uptake and translocation in root-treated seedlings compared to hypocotyl-treated ones, tolerance was not associated with prometryn concentration in lysigenous glands. Thus, the mechanism of differential prometryn tolerance in these cotton cultivars remains unclear.",
