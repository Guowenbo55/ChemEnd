Phenol was rapidly eliminated from goldfish(6) and therefore would be unlikely to bioaccumulate(SRC). When U-14C-phenol was interperitonially administered to goldfish, the concn decreased to one tenth the initial concn in 2 hr(6). A BCF of 15,800 was reported in fathead minnows using 14C labeled phenol(7). Minor amounts of 14C in tissues were present as parent compound after 28 days of exposure to radiolabeled phenol(7). Parent compound comprised 1.5% of total 14C as phenol after 28 days of depuration(7). According to a classification scheme(8), reported BCF values and the rapid elimination of phenol suggests that bioaccumulation of phenol is unlikely(SRC). According to a classification scheme, BCF values <30 are low and from 100 or greater are high(8)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Phenol is a benchmark chemical in screening tests and there is abundant data to indicate that phenol biodegrades fast in aerobic screening tests using a variety of techniques and inocula, including acclimated and unacclimated activated sludge, sewage, and soil(SRC). Only selected results are included here (SRC). In a 2-week biodegradation screening test (MITI test) using phenol (100 mg/l) and an activated sludge inoculum, 85% of theoretical BOD was removed(1). Phenol was completely removed in 1 day or less using a soil suspension(2) or activated sludge inocula(3,6). Complete degradation was observed in 4 days using sediment from an oil refinery settling pond as an inoculum(4). It was shown that the presence of aromatic compounds like benzene and naphthalene had a mild inhibitory effect on degradation(4). In five days, the BOD consumed was 90% and 50% of theoretical using a sewage inoculum and freshwater and seawater, respectively(5). Another investigator who obtained 80% of theoretical BOD consumed after 5 days demonstrated that adaptation of the inoculum has a marked effect on the biodegradation rate(8). Decreasing the concn of phenol significantly reduces the lag time required to initiate degradation and increases the removal rate(9). The maximum mineralization rates of phenol in sewage and landfill leachate were 6.5X10-4 and 2.7X10-4 hr-1, respectively(7). A lag period was observed in landfill leachate(7)."

It was completely removed in river water after 2 days at 20 \u00b0C and after 4 days at 4 \u00b0C(4). Degradation is slower in salt water; the degradation rate in the estuarine Skidway River, GA was 0.079 hr-1 (half-life 9 days)(1). Laboratory tests were conducted to ascertain the seasonal mineralization of trace levels of 14C-phenol by heterotrophic microorganisms in seston and surface sediment at four sites in southwestern Virginia(2). The mean turnover rates for the four sites between April and May 1986 at 10 \u00b0C were 0.015, 0.023, 0.023, and 0.064 mg/hr sediment ash-free dry wt (AFDW)(2). Mineralization reached a maximum of 1.21X10-4 to 1.16X10-3 mg phenol mineralized/mg AFDW-hr in October, an increase of 92-625% for seston samples and 46-128% for sediment samples over baseline August levels, despite decreasing stream temperatures(2). This autumnal peak in phenol degradation is attributed to the pulsed input of allochthonous detritus, especially leaf litter which contains substantial quantities of phenol and related compounds(2)."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ This study evaluated the potential reproductive toxicity of phenol in a rat two-generation reproduction study, which included additional study endpoints, such as sperm count and motility, developmental landmarks, histological evaluation of suspect target organs (liver, kidneys, spleen, and thymus), weanling reproductive organ weights, and an immunotoxicity screening plaque assay. Phenol was administered to 30 Sprague-Dawley rats/sex/group in the drinking water at concns of 0, 200, 1,000, or 5,000 ppm. Parental (P1) animals were treated for 10 weeks prior to mating, during mating, gestation, lactation, and until sacrifice. The F1 generation (P1 offspring) was treated using a similar regimen, while the F2 generation was not treated. After mating, 10 P1 males/group were evaluated using standard clinical pathology parameters and an immunotoxicity screening plaque assay. Significant reductions in water and food consumption were observed in the 5,000-ppm group in both generations; corollary reductions in body weight/body weight gain were also observed. Mating performance and fertility in both generations were similar to controls, and no adverse effects on vaginal cytology or male reproductive function were observed. Vaginal opening and preputial separation were delayed in the 5,000-ppm group, and were considered to be secondary to the reduction in F1 body weight. Litter survival of both generations was reduced in the 5,000-ppm group. Absolute uterus and prostate weights were decreased in the F1 generation at all dose levels; however, no underlying pathology was observed and there was no functional deficit in reproductive performance. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse. No evidence of immunotoxicity was noted in the 5,000-ppm group. The effects noted at the high concn were presumed to be associated with flavor aversion to phenol in the drinking water. Based on a comprehensive exam of all parameters, the no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for reproductive toxicity of phenol administered in drinking water to rats is 1,000 ppm. The corresponding daily intake of phenol for an adult rat at the NOAEL of 1,000 ppm is equivalent to about 70 mg/kg/day for males and 93 mg/kg/day for females."

Phenol was applied to the sciatic nerve of adult female rats either by intraneural or perineural injection. Axonal degeneration was evident within the sciatic nerve 2 days following phenol application, although variable amounts of damage were observed. By 2 weeks, the soleus and tibialis anterior had atrophied to 63% and 51% of control. Reinnervation of hindlimb muscles occurred between 2 and 4 weeks following the nerve block. Following denervation, the soleus became slower in that all of the fibers expressed the slow myosin heavy chain (MHC). At 5 months, maximum tension of the soleus was 74% of control and the muscle consisted of more fast fibers on average, some of which expressed IIx MHC. These data suggest that 5% phenol causes an injury to the nerve that is more severe than a crush injury, and that reinnervation of denervated muscles may be by motoneurons other than those that originally innervated the muscles."

Using 3 different statistical methods, it was shown that the observed joint effect was significantly higher than additive interaction, and was close to multiplicative interaction. These findings bring further support to the hypothesis that the toxic and genotoxic effects of benzene are produced by several metabolites acting synergistically."

            "Value": "Phenol is reported to have low adsorptivity to clay soils and silt loam(1) and no adsorption to aquifer material(3) and montmorillonite and kaolinite clays(8). The Koc for phenol to a Batcombe silt loam soil (pH 6.7, organic carbon 2.51%) was 30(6). It was 16 for a Brookstone clay loam (pH 5.7, organic matter 5.1%) and varied with pH and iron content of the soil(7). The Freundlich K and (1/N) for phenol in Captina (pH 5.7, 1.1 % organic matter) and Palouse silt loam (pH 5.7, 3.6% organic matter) soils were 0.58 (1.15) and 0.81 (1.00)(2); the Koc values for these soils are 91 and 39(SRC). Based on the reported Koc values, phenol would be expected to generally exhibit very high mobility in soil, based on a classification scheme(4). In a study of the adsorption of phenol onto siltstone associated with a Wyoming coal deposit suitable for in situ gasification, the pH of the solution was the major controlling factor with adsorption occurring at pH's below the pKa of phenol and no adsorption occurring at pH's above the pKa(5). The log of the Freundlich K value was approximately -4(5). Therefore, phenol may be transported by groundwater near in situ coal gasification sites due to the elevated pH's at these sites after gasification(5). The pKa of phenol is 9.99(9), indicating that it will be partially dissociated at the upper end of environmental pH range and its mobility may be pH dependent(SRC). In general, anions generally do not adsorb to organic carbon and clay as strongly as their neutral counterparts(10)."
