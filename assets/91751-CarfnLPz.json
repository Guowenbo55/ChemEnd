Absorption increased over time for all species, with differing percentages absorbed after two days\u20148% for common cocklebur, 33% for common lambsquarters, and 26% for sicklepod. However, the retention of the absorbed herbicide within the treated leaves varied significantly among the species: 53% in common cocklebur, 80% in common lambsquarters, and 93% in sicklepod. Notably, sicklepod exhibited the highest retention of the absorbed herbicide within treated leaves. Translocation of the herbicide also differed markedly among the species. Common cocklebur translocated 33% of the absorbed herbicide to upper shoots, whereas common lambsquarters translocated 15% and sicklepod only 5%. Additionally, there were notable differences in herbicide translocation into lower shoots and roots among the species, aligning with their sensitivity levels\u2014greater translocation occurred in the more sensitive species (common cocklebur) and less in the most tolerant species (sicklepod). These differences in absorption and translocation across these weed species contribute to the varying sensitivity observed at the whole plant level.",
