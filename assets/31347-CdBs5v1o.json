    "Description": "Sulfolane is a member of the class of tetrahydrothiophenes that is tetrahydrothiophene in which the sulfur has been oxidised to give the corresponding sulfone. A colourless, high-boiling (285??) liquid that is miscible with both water and hydrocarbons, it is used as an industrial solvent, particularly for the purification of hydrocarbon mixtures by liquid-vapour extraction. It has a role as a polar aprotic solvent. It is a sulfone and a member of tetrahydrothiophenes. It derives from a hydride of a tetrahydrothiophene.",

Sulfolane, present at 100 mg/L, reached 10.1% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(3). On the other hand, more than 99% of sulfolane at an initial concn of 100 mg/L biodegraded by activated sludge cultures in 1 day in a batch die-away test(4). In a bench scale aerated lagoon reactor, more than 90% degradation of sulfolane occured at an initial concn 20-80 mg/L biodegraded at hydraulic retention time of 2-2.4 days(4). Inorganic sulfate has been identified as the biodegradation product of sulfolane(4). Aquifer slurries using sediment and groundwater from a sour natural gas plant were shown to be capable of degrading sulfolane at 26 and 8 \u00b0C under aerobic conditions(5). Following a 10 day acclimation period, sulfolane added at 20 mg/L to aquifer slurries degraded with half-lives of approximately 2-3 days at 26 \u00b0C depending upon whether nitrogen and phosphorous containing nutrients were added(5). At 8 degrees C, sulfolane degradation proceeded at a slower rate, particularly in the absence of nutrients; however, complete degradation was observed within 20 days(5)."

Two experiments were conducted using male CD-1 Swiss mice. One was carried out at preferred ambient temperature, and the other measured metabolic rate and colonic temperature of sulfolane induced mice. Mice received intraperitoneal doses of 0 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, or 800 mg/kg in a volume of 0.3 mL/100 g body weight. After injection of control (physiological saline) or sulfolane, mice were placed in an environmental chamber at three different ambient temperature values and after 1 hour, metabolic rates and colonic temperatures were measured. Sulfolane significantly lowered preferred ambient temperature at several different doses (400 to 800 mg/kg range). Decreases in metabolic rate and body temperature were observed at ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C after sulfolane injections. It was reported that there were significant correlations (at ambient temperature of 20, 30, and 35 \u00b0C) between metabolic rate and body temperature. A relationship between percent mortality and ambient temperature was suggested and from this, it was concluded that the hypothermic and or hypometabolic condition of sulfolane induced mice enhanced their survivability."

In the present study, subcutaneous injections of 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 750 mg/kg sulfolane at an ambient temperature of 10 \u00b0C caused a dose-dependent decrease in colonic temperature of rabbits. Metabolic rate remained unchanged during the initial phase of the hypothermia for all dose groups; but peripheral vasodilation, as indicated by an increase in ear skin temperature, was seen at the higher dose levels. The observed thermoregulatory response to sulfolane was a function of ambient temperature. Thus, at ambient temperatures of 10 and 20 \u00b0C, injection of 600 mg/kg sulfolane had no effect on metabolic rate but caused an increase in ear skin temperature. The magnitude of the hypothermia was similar at these two ambient temperatures, indicating the sulfolane treated rabbits had some control over colonic temperature. At an ambient temperature of 28 \u00b0C, however, the animals became hyperthermic upon injection of 600 mg/kg sulfolane."

A total of four male New-Zealand white rabbits were used in this investigation. The animals were stereotaxically implanted with a 19 gauge injection cannula and an 18 gauge thermocouple reentrant tube over the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area. Rabbits recovered at least 7 days before the experiments began. Sulfolane was diluted with sterile 0.9% saline to yield dosages of 100, 300, and 1000 ug in 3 mL volumes. Repeated exposures to sulfolane were spaced at least 1 week apart. The results indicated that the thermoregulatory effects following systemic exposure to sulfolane were not due to a direct action of the compound on the central nervous system. Microinjection of sulfolane directly into the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area of rabbits had no thermoregulatory effect and intracerebroventricular injection of sulfolane caused a minimal rise in body temperature. It was suggested that the thermoregulatory effect of sulfolane was due to an action at a brain site other than the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area. For this reason, microinjections of sulfolane were made into the cerebral ventricle. With an extremely large dose, the onset of hyperthermia was delayed about 30 minutes. This delay was accompanied by a distinct peripheral vasodilation, and the decrease in temperature preoptic anterior hypothalamic area was small and transient. While the specific site of action was not identified, the central thermoregulatory action of sulfolane was in the opposite direction of the systemic thermoregulatory actions. It was suggested that the thermoregulatory action may be triggered by the primary metabolite, 3-hydroxysulfolane, which may act on the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area or other levels of the central nervous system."

Amplitudes of flash evoked potentials peaks to the first of a pair of stimuli were generally increased compared to control, an effect which was not temperature dependent.
