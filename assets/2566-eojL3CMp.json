Carbofuran was detected in 10 of 28 vegetables growing in soils in Southwestern Ontario in 1976 at a concentration range of a trace (below 0.1 ppm) to 7.33 ppm(2). Carbofuran was applied over seeded rutabaga and residues of the insecticide and its metabolites were measured in harvested specimens(3). Concentrations in the root peels averaged 0.15, 0.23 and 0.07; in the pulp averages were 0.09, 0.14 and 0.05 ppm for carbofuran, hydroxycarbofuran, and 3-ketocarbofuran, respectively(3). Combined residues were below the 0.5 ppm tolerance established for this crop(3). Carbofuran 10G granules were applied to sandy loam soil (pH 5.0, 54% sand, 30% silt, 8% clay) surrounding the roots of mugho pine trees at rates in the range of 0.4-2.0 g ai/tree(4).

            "Value": "Carbofuran residues were not detected on any sampling day in zooplankton, black bullheads, or bluegill in a farm pond treated with the insecticide for 2 years (0.025 ppm the first year and 0.050 ppm the second year)(1). Carbofuran residues were not detected in caterpillars, freshwater clams, freshwater crabs, or frogs following the application of 5 mg of carbon-labeled carbofuran to a laboratory aquatic ecosystem(2). Only low residual amounts of carbofuran were found in mosquito larvae and fish (Gambusia) in a model ecosystem treated with carbofuran(3). Carbofuran did not bioconcentrate in caddisfly eggs when exposed for over 120 hours(4). A measured BCF value of 10 was reported for the snail Pila luzonica(5). The addition of carbofuran to a rice/fish model ecosystem after 30 days equilibration resulted in higher bioaccumulation for Tilapia nilotica and Ctenopharyngodon idellus than when carbofuran was initially mixed with the soil in the ecosystem; residue concentrations were highest 2 to 3 days following carbofuran treatment(6). Water from a rice paddy was drained into an adjacent fish pond; carbofuran residues were concentrated in the fish entrails with highest concentrations reported within 5-10 days(7). There was no evidence for the concentration of carbofuran in fish using a rice/fish model ecosystem(8). The uptake of radio-labeled carbofuran by southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii Barber, larvae was measured at different concentrations of insecticide and in soils with organic contents of 0.46%, 1.76%, 1.85%, 3.50%(9). Maximum uptake was recorded after 24 hours and then stabilized(9). Uptake correlated with organic content of soil, more carbofuran being absorbed in the soils with less organic carbon content(9)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Under laboratory conditions and 8 weeks of incubation, 77% of applied carbofuran remained in sterile muck while only 25% remained in non-sterile muck; 50% remained in sterile loam while none remained in non-sterile loam(1). The rate of CO2 release two weeks after incubating a vineyard soil with carbofuran was 40 times greater than when the soil had been autoclaved(2). Carbofuran was rapidly lost from cornfield soils both with and without a history of carbofuran use, but virtually no loss was observed when the soil was autoclaved(3). The main metabolite of carbofuran in soil is 3-ketocarbofuran; small amounts of 3-hydroxycarbofuran, carbofuran phenol, and 3-ketocarbofuran phenol were also present(4). The dominant fate of the carbonyl group of carbofuran, once added to non-history soils, is hydrolysis of the carbamate bond followed by rapid mineralization of the methylamine(5). Non-sterile samples exhibited a lag phase followed by a period of rapid hydrolysis; the reaction is essentially complete after 14 days with CO2 production from 77.6-100% of the added labeled carbofuran(5). A half-life of 8-10 days was determined for carbofuran in paddy soils. In pond water, a biodegradation half-life of 2 days was reported for early rice and 5-6 days for late rice treated with carbofuran(6). Carbofuran dissipation from paddy water was rapid with an estimated dissipation time for 50% initial concentration (DT50) of 3 days and a DT95 of 13 days; the DT50 from paddy soil was about 10 days and the DT95 was 42 days; dissipation was due to both hydrolysis and biodegradation(7)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The rate of degradation of carbofuran in soil is greatly increased by pretreatment with carbofuran(1-9); this does not appear to be due to a substantial increase in the microbial population(1). In previously untreated soil, 90% of the initial carbofuran added remained after 1 day; only 3% remained after the same time in a soil which had been treated with carbofuran 13 weeks previously(2). Heat sterilization, freezing or drying of this soil drastically reduced the rate of degradation, suggesting that degradation is due to biological processes(2). Sequences of treatments of carbofuran after fensulfothion or fensulfothion after carbofuran resulted in faster breakdown of the second than of the first field treatment but breakdown was slower than following the second application of the same compound(3). Degradation was complete in 15 days using Italian soils previously treated with carbofuran as opposed to 30 days in un-treated soils(4). Soil previously treated with tri-allate gave an enhanced degradation rate for carbofuran(10). The degradation of 14C-ring carbofuran was not enhanced in soils pretreated with its hydrolysis product, carbofuran phenol(11). Enhanced biodegradation of carbofuran was not seen using a Lima silt loam; degradation of this compound may occur through cometabolic processes as no increase in the microbial population is seen in acclimated soils and as there is little incorporation of 14C-label into cellular biomass(12)."

Biodegradation of carbofuran in soil may proceed in two steps: hydrolysis of the carbonyl side chain followed by the adsorption of the primary metabolite, causing a decrease in ring breakdown(1-2). Degradation of soluble and sorbed carbonyl-14C-carbofuran at differing soil moisture was measured; rates of degradation were comparable at 20 and 17.5% moisture with >97% degradation within 14 days and 14CO2 recoveries of 90%(3). Rates decreased with diminishing moisture content until only 7% of 14CO2 was recovered after 5 weeks at 7.5% moisture(3). The decrease in biodegradation with decreasing soil moisture content was due to dessication and not to decreasing availability of the pesticide(3). Carbofuran was mineralized in all subsoil samples of Monchengladbach soil showing a decrease in mineralization with depth(4). Carbofuran biodegradation was studied under field conditions at three different depths; half-lives of 14, 14, and 73 days were reported for 2, 20, and 60 cm depth, respectively(5). In another soil, 0.2, 4.6, 30.7, and 40.3% of the initial carbofuran was extracted following 5 months of incubation at 0-10, 20-30, 50-60, and 90-100 cm depth, respectively(6)."

The persistence values (total residence time) obtained were 56 and 63 days for the first and second yr(2). Drained water, from soil rich in organic matter, was found to have a high carbofuran content, 7.1-13.7% and 2.5-5.0% of the applied dose for clay and loamy clay soils, respectively(2). Koc values for carbofuran of 0, 0, 27.03, and 29.28 were measured for four rice-growing soils in India, a laterite (pH 7.2, 0.62% organic carbon), a alluvial soil (pH 6.2, 1.62% organic carbon), an acid sulfate Pokkali (pH 3.6, 7.1% organic carbon), and an acid sulfate Kari soil (pH 2.7, 8.8% organic carbon)(3)."

The results showed that both compounds were transferred from the roots of tomato plants to their fruits. The concentration of oxamyl in tomato fruits reached 33.4 ppb after one day of application, increased to 123.5 ppb after 10 days, and then decreased to 51.1 ppb at the end of the 21-day experiment. On the other hand, the absorbed amount of carbofuran in tomato fruits reached 312.9 ppb after one day, increased to 1003 ppb after 10 days, and then declined to 130.1 ppb at the end of the experiment. The average recoveries of oxamyl and carbofuran from tomato fruits at various spiking levels were 82.6% and 80.2%, respectively. Oxamyl was metabolized to oximino oxamyl, with the amount of this metabolite reaching 569.5 ppb after one day, increasing to 609.9 ppb after three days, and then dropping to 184.8 ppb after 10 days before increasing again to 300.1 ppb at the end of the experiment. On the other hand, carbofuran was slightly metabolized to 3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran phenol, with the levels of 3-hydroxycarbofuran being greater than 3-ketocarbofuran phenol at all times following application. The results indicated that the translocation and persistence of carbofuran were greater than oxamyl in tomato plants.",
