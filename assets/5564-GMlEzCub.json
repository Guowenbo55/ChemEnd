    "Description": "Triclosan is an aromatic ether that is phenol which is substituted at C-5 by a chloro group and at C-2 by a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy group. It is widely used as a preservative and antimicrobial agent in personal care products such as soaps, skin creams, toothpaste and deodorants as well as in household items such as plastic chopping boards, sports equipment and shoes. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, a fungicide, an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor, an antimalarial, an EC 1.3.1.9 [enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADH)] inhibitor, a xenobiotic, a persistent organic pollutant and a drug allergen. It is a member of phenols, an aromatic ether, a dichlorobenzene and a member of monochlorobenzenes.",
