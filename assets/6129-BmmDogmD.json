    "Description": "Carbaryl is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of 1-naphthol with methylcarbamic acid. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a carbamate insecticide, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide, an agrochemical and a plant growth retardant. It is a carbamate ester and a member of naphthalenes. It is functionally related to a methylcarbamic acid and a 1-naphthol.",

Four applications of 1 lb active ingredient per acre resulted in an average residue 8 days after the last application of 16.5 ppm on spinach and 18 ppm on chicory.

The rate of dissipation of carbaryl on plants appears to be independent of initial concentration."

Formation of (14-C)-carbon dioxide from ring labeled carbaryl added at 200 ppm to a variety of soils ranged from 2.2-37.4% after incubation at 25 \u00b0C for 32 days(2). After application to corn seed furrows at 5.03 kg/ha active ingredient, carbaryl was stable for 25 to 116 days then degraded rapidly, the lag periods indicating that carbaryl degradation was primarily microbiological(3). The long period of persistence followed by rapid degradation was said to indicate microbial degradation(3). Incubation with activated sludge caused about 30% biodegradation of the compound in 5 days(8). In soils previously treated with carbamates and cloethocarb, 80% of carbaryl completely mineralized to C02 during a 4-week incubation(9). Biodegradation was faster in organic-amended soil than unamended soil(10,11). Soil-bound carbaryl residues mineralized faster in moist than flooded soils(10) indicating aerobic biodegradation may be faster than the anaerobic process. Various soil fungi metabolized carbaryl to 1-naphthyl N-hydroxy-methylcarbamate, 4-hydroxy-1-naphthyl methylcarbamate and 5-hydroxy-1-naphthyl methylcarbamate(4). Three microbial strains isolated from soil were able to accelerate the rate of carbaryl hydrolysis to 1-naphthol(5). Fusarium solani degraded 82% of the initial carbaryl after 12 days and an unidentified strain degraded 51% after 7 days(5). A mixed culture of any two or all three strains completely metabolized the initial amount of carbaryl after about 12 days(5). All the cultures were incubated at 26-28 \u00b0C(5). An Aspergillus terrens culture metabolized carbaryl to 1-naphthyl carbamate(6). Approximately 50% of the initial amount of carbaryl was metabolized in 8 days(6). Achromobacter sp degraded carbaryl as a sole carbon source(7)."

The chemicals tested were carbaryl, carbofuran, formetanate, methiocarb, methomyl, oxamyl, and propoxur. All were administered orally, and rats were tested in 20-min activity sessions beginning 15 min after dosing; tissues were collected immediately after activity sessions. In general, motor activity was a sensitive measure of ChE inhibition for all these carbamate pesticides, and vertical activity showed the greatest magnitude of effect at the highest doses compared to either horizontal activity or ChE inhibition. Brain and RBC ChE activities were generally affected similarly. Pearson correlation coefficients of within-subject data showed good correlation between the behavioral and biochemical end points, with brain ChE inhibition and horizontal activity showing the highest correlation values. Determination of benchmark dose levels for 10% change in each end point also revealed that these two measures produced the lowest estimates. Thus, motor activity decreases are highly predictive of ChE inhibition for N-methyl carbamates, and vice versa."

A high dose was selected that produced clear cholinergic signs, and lower doses were chosen to produce a range of effects. Generally all cholinesterase inhibitors produced autonomic signs of cholinergic overstimulation (salivation, lacrimation, and miosis), hypothermia, mild tremors and mouth-smacking (chewing motions), lowered motor activity, decreased tail-pinch response, and altered neuromuscular function (gait changes and increased foot splay). The measures generally found to be most sensitive on the day of dosing were body temperature, motor activity, gait, and the presence of mouth-smacking and fine tremors. However, no single measure was the most sensitive across all compounds ... . For some measures, differences in the slopes of the dose-response curves were evident. Many effects were still observed at 24 hr, but recovery was apparent for all compounds. Interestingly, residual effects at 72 hr were obtained with the carbamates (carbaryl, aldicarb) as well as with the Op fenthion, but not with the other compounds. Thus, the overall clinical picture of toxicity was similar for these cholinesterase inhibitors, but compound-specific differences emerged in terms of the individual measures, dose-response, and time course."

Differences in sensitivity of this enzyme to inhibition were studied after intraperitoneal administration to chickens and rats. A dose of 900 mg/kg to chickens and 70 mg/kg to rats caused equivalent inhibition of brain cholinesterase activities (57% +/- 6 and 47% +/- 4, respectively) 60 min after administration, which was the time of maximal cholinergic signs. Signs of toxicity (salivation, respiratory distress, muscle tremors and weakness) were more pronounced in rats than in chickens when brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited to the same extent in both species. Carboxylesterase activities in brain, liver, and plasma were also inhibited 60 min after administration of carbaryl to chickens and rats. Activities of enzymes associated with hepatic microsomes were unaffected. Specific activities of brain esterases, including acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterase and neurotoxic esterase, were higher in untreated chickens than in untreated rats. Specific activities of liver esterases (carboxylesterase, A-esterase) were, however, 4- and 10-fold lower in untreated chickens than in untreated rats. Total clearance of carbaryl in the chicken, determined after intravenous administration of 5 mg/kg, was 0.26 +/- 0.02 l/kg/min. This value is 5.7 times higher than that reported for the rat, indicating that the relatively lower activities of esterases in the liver of chickens did not affect the clearance of this chemical in the avian species."

FEPs were recorded in Long Evans rats treated with physostigmine (sc) 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg (free base), in an ascorbic acid/saline vehicle, carbaryl (po) 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 50 or 75 mg/kg, or propoxur (po) 0, 0.3, 3, 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg in a corn oil vehicle. Physostigmine served as positive control based on literature data. Early (e.g. peak N(36)) and late FEP components (peak N(166) and PhAD) are related to the initial retino-geniculate afferent volley and higher cortical processing of visual information, respectively. Compared to controls, the PhAD duration decreased following treatment with 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg physostigmine, 7 5 mg/kg carbaryl or 30 mg/kg propoxur. Lesser changes were noted in FEP amplitudes or peak latencies. Treatment with 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg physostigmine increased peak N(36) latency. Peak N(166) latency increased only following exposure to 40 mg/kg propoxur. None of the compounds altered peak N(36) or N(166) amplitudes. Hypothermia was observed at doses greater than 0.05 mg/kg physostigmine, at 30 or 50 mg/kg carbaryl, and after treatment with 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg propoxur. Inhibition of brain ChE activity occurred at dosages greater than 0.05 mg/kg physostigmine, 1mg/kg carbaryl, and 0.3 mg/kg propoxur. Linear regression analysis indicated that the decrease in PhAD duration correlated with decrease in brain ChE activity. The results indicate that at 30 min after treatment, inhibition of brain ChE activity did not affect cortical processing of the input from the retino-geniculate volley (evidenced by unaltered peak N(36) amplitude). However, the data suggest that disruption of cortical processing of visual signals related to FEP late components, as indicated by depression of the PhAD, was related to inhibition of brain ChE activity."

Studies showed that juveniles are generally more susceptible to neurotoxic insult than adults. However, little is known concerning the effects of OP and CB pesticides on thermoregulation in developing animals. Thus, alterations in core body temperature (Tc) in juvenile animals exposed to an OP and CB insecticide were investigated. Male rat pups were anesthetized on postnatal day (PND) 15 with metofane and a radio transmitter (Data Sciences) was implanted in the abdominal cavity to monitor Tc and motor activity (MA). Two days were allowed for recovery. The PND 17 pups were then dosed by oral gavage with the OP chlorpyrifos (CHP) (1, 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or the CB carbaryl (CAR) (10, 20, 80, 120, or 160 mg/kg) or the corn oil vehicle. Pups were returned to their dams and littermates immediately after dosing and monitored for the next several days. CHP doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg resulted in 1.0 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C reductions in Tc, respectively. Tc recovered to control levels by approximately 16 h after dosing. There was significant mortality in rats dosed with 15 mg/kg CHP (6 of 11). CAR doses of 10 to 80 mg/kg had little effect on Tc. The highest dose of CAR (160 mg/kg) resulted in a 1.3 degrees C reduction in Tc that recovered in 9 h. In contrast, past studies found that adult male rats become hypothermic at CHP doses of >25 mg/kg, whereas a CAR dose of 50 mg/kg is effective at inducing hypothermia. Overall, it appears that during the development from preweanling to adult rat, there is a progressive attenuation in CHP-induced hypothermia. Conversely, CAR-induced hypothermia increases as a function of development."

This nitrosamide, nitrosocarbaryl, has been proved to be mutagenic and carcinogenic, at high doses in animals. A condition of this nitrosation is an acidic pH (<2), which is comparable to the one found in the human stomach. However, nitrosocarbaryl is not stable at this pH. Its maximum stability is between pH 3 and 5, at which pH no significant amount of carbaryl can be nitrosated. Carbaryl was nitrosated in several studies,  in vitro as well as in vivo, in the guinea-pig, which has a stomach acidity similar to that of humans. N-nitrosocarbaryl elicited a carcinogenic response in both sexes of two strains of rats (Wistar and Sprague-Dawley) by two routes of administration (oral gavage and subcutaneous injection). A local carcinogenic effect of N-nitrosocarbaryl was reported ... in Wistar rats given a single subcutaneous injection of 1000 mg/kg. Fifteen out of 16 treated animals developed sarcomas at the injection site; there was no histopathological evidence of any systemic carcinogenic effects. The dose of  N-nitrosocarbaryl was highly toxic and 14 out of 16 animals had died by day 450. No spontaneous tumors were observed in control animals. When given to rats orally in single doses of 200-1500 mg/kg,  N-nitrosocarbaryl did not induce tumors during 21 months of observation. No signs of toxicity were noted in any of the test groups.  Further studies involving repeated oral administration of N-nitrosocarbaryl to Sprague-Dawley rats gave unequivocal evidence of local carcinogenic effects, produced by both oral and subcutaneous routes of administration. The nonglandular part of the stomach (forestomach) was the target organ of the local carcinogenic action of  N-nitrosocarbaryl, when it was given orally to rats. All stages of malignant transformation in the forestomach, from hyperplasia to squamous cell carcinoma, were observed in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with oral doses of 130 mg  N-nitrosocarbaryl/kg, twice weekly, until spontaneous death. There was a substantial lowering of the survival rate of treated animals because of the pronounced toxicity. By the time of maximum increase of the tumor incidence (after 200 days), most of the animals were dead. The average survival time of tumor-bearing animals was 167 days after the onset of the study. The low background tumor incidence (3 out of 29) in control animals included lymphosarcomas and leukemia. /N-nitrosocarbaryl/"

The most characteristic terata, classified as abnormal tail flexure, involved a significant percentage of larvae from 1 mg/L CB onward, reaching 100% at 24 mg/L CB. Histopathological screening revealed tail musculature and notochord as the main targets for CB. Skeletal muscle lesions consisted of myotomes reduced in size, showing myocytes with disorganized contractile systems and irregular myosepta, coupled with disarranged myocyte apexes. Notochords from CB exposed larvae appeared wavy or bent, with irregular connective sheaths and histologically characterized by protrusions of fibrous matrix and inclusions of ectopic cell masses. This axial-skeletal damage was hypothesized to be related both to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, with consequent muscular tetanic spasms, and to disorders in the organization of the connective tissue matrix surrounding the notochord."

It was reported that the treatment caused a changed sex ratio, changes in eye color, and various chromosomal aberrations in the offspring. The small amounts of material used and the lack of any detailed presentation of the findings preclude any evaluation or conclusion. At high doses (0.3 mL from a 1% suspension of 85% commercial product in glucose), carbaryl caused a slight increase in mutation frequency in the F1 generation males of a Drosophila line, which were studied at different stages of spermatogenesis. There were no deletions or disturbed fertility. ...A sensitive experimental protocol that incorporated the mating scheme with repair-deficient females reported that carbaryl was not mutagenic for Drosophila. F1 male progeny of males that had ring X chromosomes and double marked Y chromosomes, were treated with carbaryl at 200 mg/L and mated with mus-302, repair-deficient females of  Drosophila. The male progeny did not show any induced complete (ring chromosome) or partial (Y chromosome markers) chromosome loss."

Carbaryl was used at 10-6 molar. Individual cell activities were assessed by microspectrofluorimetry. Two groups of cells were identified, one (70%) with high benzo(a)pyrene metabolism and the other (30%) with little or no benzo(a)pyrene metabolizing capability. Carbaryl, which does not require metabolism to be toxic, decreased the number of cells in the low benzo(a)pyrene metabolizing category without changing rate constants, when exposure was for 9 to 11 days. Longer exposure (14 to 31 days) caused complete elimination of this class of cells, and some rate constants were increased in the high metabolism class. Both compounds activate the same mixed-function-oxidase system and there are two 3T3 cell subpopulations which present different responses to treatment with carbaryl, reflecting differences in aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase activity."

The effect of carbaryl on superoxide production and on the release of 1-(14)C-labeled arachidonic acid and (14)C-labeled prostaglandins was dose-dependent. For 2.5x10-6 M of carbaryl, superoxide production and prostaglandin release were not significantly inhibited. At 12.5x10-6 M, the inhibitory effect was apparent for superoxide production (33%) and for the release of 6-keto-PGF1alpha (60%), PGE2 (42%), PGF2alpha (38%), PGD2 (33%). Carbaryl had no effect on the level of free arachidonic acid. Insecticide at 12.5x10-6 M significantly decreased the deacylation of the phosphatidylcholine (20%). Incubation of resident peritoneal macrophages with indomethacin studied conjointly decreased only the prostaglandin release. Evidently carbaryl decreases the sequence of events following the binding of an agent to its receptor and leading to the induction of phospholipase activity. The effect of this pesticide on phospholipid metabolism and its consequences on macrophage stimulation are discussed. Ecto-serine esterase inhibition in the mechanism of the pesticide was suggested."

This activity is usually mediated by the interaction of the compound with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. However, it has been proposed that this mechanism does not apply to carbaryl because its structure differs from that of typical aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands. /It is shown/ ... here that carbaryl promotes activation of target genes in a yeast-based bioassay expressing both aryl hydrocarbon receptor and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. By contrast, carbaryl acted as a competitive inhibitor, rather than as an agonist, in a simplified yeast system, in which aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator function is bypassed by fusing aryl hydrocarbon receptor to a heterologous DNA binding domain. This dual action of carbaryl, agonist and partial antagonist, was also observed by comparing carbaryl response in two vertebrate cell lines. A yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the mammalian coactivator cAMP response element-binding protein readily interacts with aryl hydrocarbon receptor bound to its canonical ligand beta-naphthoflavone, but not with the carbaryl-aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex. /It was proposed/ that carbaryl interacts with aryl hydrocarbon receptor, but that its peculiar structure imposes a substandard configuration on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand-binding domain that prevents interaction with key coactivators and activates transcription without the need for aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. This effect may be relevant in explaining its physiological effects in exposed animals, and may help to predict its effects, and that of similar compounds, in humans. /The/ data also identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/cAMP response element-binding protein interaction as a molecular target for the identification and development of new aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists."

Studies on HepG2 and HaCaT cell lines showed that carbaryl is capable of increasing, in a dose-dependent manner, both the ethoxyresorufin rufin-O-dec, O-deethylase activity and the steady-state concentrations of CYP1A1 mRNA, suggesting a transcriptional activation of this gene. When alpha-naphthoflavone, a partial Ah receptor (AhR) antagonist, and 8-methoxypsoralen, which interferes with the binding of activated AhR to the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE), were added to the cultures, CYP1A1 induction was suppressed. However, competitive binding studies using the 9S enriched fraction of human cytosol indicated that carbaryl did not displace [3H]TCDD from AhR.
