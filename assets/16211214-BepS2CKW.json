In the current paper, the effect of boron in the form of borax was tested in experimental animal model of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). The syndrome was induced in female Wistar rats by three consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide (400 mg/kg). In the treatment groups, rats received borax (4.0 mg/kg) orally for three consecutive days followed by thioacetamide. The group administered with thioacetamide plus vehicle, and the borax alone treated rats served as controls. In all groups, rats were terminated 4 hr after administering the last dose of thioacetamide, and the tissue/serum was used to measure hepatic levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione, and various enzymes associated with oxidative stress including peroxide metabolizing enzymes and xanthine oxidase. In thioacetamide treated group, many fold increase in the activity level of serum marker enzymes suggesting FHF was observed that could be brought down significantly in rats receiving boron. Modulation and a correlation in the activity level of oxidant generating enzyme and lipid peroxidation as well as hepatic glutathione level was also observed in rats receiving thioacetamide. In the group receiving boron followed by thioacetamide, these changes could be minimized moderately. The activity level of the peroxide metabolizing enzymes and the tripeptide glutathione, which decreased following thioacetamide treatment were moderately elevated in the group receiving boron followed by thioacetamide. The data clearly shows that borax partly normalizes the liver and offsets the deleterious effects observed in FHF by modulating the oxidative stress parameters."

Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into three equal groups: the animals in the first group (control) were fed with a standard rodent diet containing 6.4 mg/kg /boron/, and the animals in the experimental group were fed with a standard rodent diet added with a supra-nutritional amount of boric acid and borax (100 mg/kg /boron/) throughout the experimental period of 28 days. The B compounds decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA damage, the protein carbonyl content (PCO) level in blood, and glutathione (GSH) concentration in the liver, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity in the kidney. The B compounds increased GSH concentration in blood and the vitamin C level in plasma. Consequently, our results demonstrate that B supplementation (100 mg/kg) in diet decreases LPO, and enhances the antioxidant defense mechanism and vitamin status. There are no differences in oxidant/antioxidant balance and biochemical parameters except for serum vitamin A and liver GSH concentration, between the boron compounds used in this study."

The toxicological end points of concern identified for both boric-acid and borax from animal studies were fertility and developmental toxicity. The lowest no observed adverse effect level for fertility in male and female rats was 17mg/kg boron (7440428) for both boric-acid and borax. Effects observed at the low observed adverse effect level included testicular toxicity, reduced spermiation in males and decreased ovulation in females. Testicular atrophy was noted at higher doses. Only boric-acid data was available for developmental toxicity from rat, mouse, and rabbit studies. The most sensitive species was the rat with a no observed adverse effect level of 0.5mg/kg boron, based on reduced fetal body weight and skeletal effects. A tolerable daily intake of borates for a 60 kilogram person was calculated to be 34 milligrams (mg) boron/day and 19.2mg boron/day which could be ingested without the risk of fertility or developmental effects, respectively. Considering that the maximum boron intake from the diet is 7mg/day from food, mineral waters, and other beverages including wine, up to 12mg boron could be obtained from other resources without exceeding the daily intake limit."

The study reveals that foliar uptake of borax was relatively low, reaching only about 10% within 48 hours post-treatment and 12.2% after 12 days. Variability in uptake rates was noticeable, with higher consistency observed in plants treated with Solubor. Interestingly, the study reported substantial differences in foliar uptake among various plant species, with some showing near-complete uptake within 24 hours while others only absorbed a minute fraction of the applied borax. Additionally, the translocation of borax from treated leaves to non-treated aerial parts and roots increased notably over time, suggesting a gradual redistribution. Chemical composition of the applied solution influenced borax distribution within non-treated parts shortly after application but became indistinguishable between treatments after 12 days. The study underscores the mobility of foliar-applied borax, albeit not as rapid as reported in certain cases, highlighting the complexity of its translocation, which is influenced by factors like leaf age and plant boron supply. The research calls for further exploration to elucidate the diverse translocation mechanisms among plant species and to clarify the nature of soluble boron complexes involved in its phloem mobility. This emphasizes the need for continued investigations into formulations, additives, and environmental factors to enhance borax uptake efficiency in foliar treatments, particularly focusing on its translocation patterns across different plant species and climatic conditions.",
