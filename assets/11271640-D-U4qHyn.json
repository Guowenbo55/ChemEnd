    "Description": "Chlorantraniliprole is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxylic acid group of 3-bromo-1-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 2-amino-5-chloro-N,3-dimethylbenzamide. The first of the anthranilic diamide insecticides, it is a ryanodine receptor activator and is used to protect a wide variety of crops, including corn, cotton, grapes, rice and potatoes. It has a role as a ryanodine receptor agonist. It is an organobromine compound, a member of pyridines, a member of pyrazoles, a pyrazole insecticide, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a secondary carboxamide.",

Chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole were applied via seed treatment and foliar spray in corn (VE and V3) to characterize the systemic action of both molecules in leaves that appeared after application. Bioassays with S. frugiperda and chemical quantification in LC-MS/MS confirmed the absorption and upward translocation of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole by xylem to new leaves. Both insecticides caused the mortality of larvae up to stage V6 (57.5\u00b19.5% for chlorantraniliprole and 40\u00b18.1% for cyantraniliprole), indicating the translocation of insecticides into leaves of corn plants when applied via seed treatment. However, the translocation of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole from sprayed leaves to new leaves was not observed, regardless of the stage of application plus the next first, second, and third stages. An increased dosage of cyantraniliprole did not influence its translocation in plant tissues; however, it influenced the present amount of active ingredient. The application of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole in seed treatment is an important alternative for integrated pest management. The absorption and redistribution capacity of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole throughout the plant confer a prolonged residual action with satisfactory control of S. frugiperda.",
