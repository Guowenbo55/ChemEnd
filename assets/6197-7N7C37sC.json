    "Description": "Cycloheximide is a dicarboximide that is 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidine-2,6-dione in which one of the hydrogens attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxy group is replaced by a 3,5-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl group. It is an antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces griseus. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a protein synthesis inhibitor, a neuroprotective agent, an anticoronaviral agent and a ferroptosis inhibitor. It is a member of piperidones, a piperidine antibiotic, an antibiotic fungicide, a dicarboximide, a secondary alcohol and a cyclic ketone. It is functionally related to a piperidine-2,6-dione.",

            "content": "The research highlights the systemic activity of cycloheximide in plant fungal disease control, particularly in white pine species. Evidence demonstrates its systemic nature in both eastern and western white pines, revealing its potential as a systemic fungicide. Tritium-labeled cycloheximide was employed to investigate its systemic behavior in eastern white pine seedlings, confirming its upward translocation through the transpiration stream, concentrating in the needles and upper stem after application. While not rapidly degraded by eastern white pine needles, it persists longer, especially at higher concentrations, indicating its systemic nature within the plant tissues for extended periods, up to at least 57 days without significant loss. Although the translocation in eastern white pine might be less efficient compared to western white pine, the persistence of cycloheximide in the former species points to its systemic behavior, offering insights into its application and distribution in plant tissues. This tritium-labeling technique presents an accurate approach for studying cycloheximide's translocation and persistence within pine seedlings, offering wide applicability in systemic studies of this pesticide.",
