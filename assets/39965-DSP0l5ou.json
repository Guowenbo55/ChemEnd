            "Value": "SOIL: The spatial distribution of hexazinone was measured in forest soil for 2 yr following the aerial application of a granular formulation, Pronone 10G, in northern Alberta, Canada. Initial deposition rates of two hexazinone treatments averaged 2.3 and 4.1 kg/ha for each triplicated plot. One yr after application, residues of hexazinone averaged 0.25 and 0.40 kg/ha in 2.3 and 4.1 kg/ha treatment, respectively, in the 0-10 cm surface soil; and were distributed vertically in soil depths of 0-10 cm surface, 10-20 cm at rations of 10:11:2 and 10:5:2, respectively, in 2.3 and 4.1 kg/ha treatment. Two yr after application, the vertical movement of hexazinone in soil was quantifiable to 40 cm depth in both 2.3 and 4.1 kg/ha treatment plots. Trace amounts of hexazinone were detected at 130 cm only in the 2.3 kg/ha plot, which is likely due to the more freely downward movement of hexazinone to deeper horizons along decayed root channels(1)."

After four hours, 14C was detected in all sections of winged elm treated with both 14C-tebuthiuron and 14C-hexazinone. The absorption of tebuthiuron label by the other species through the roots occurred in the following order: loblolly pine > bur oak > black walnut = eastern redcedar. Similarly, the absorption of hexazinone label followed the sequence: loblolly pine > black walnut > bur oak = eastern redcedar. Regarding foliar accumulation, the tebuthiuron label was found to accumulate in the following order: bur oak > loblolly pine > eastern redcedar = black walnut. On the other hand, the sequence for hexazinone accumulation was: loblolly pine > bur oak > black walnut = eastern redcedar. The presence of three metabolites of hexazinone in loblolly pine suggests that this species may exhibit resistance to hexazinone due to its ability to degrade the herbicide rather than its ability to limit uptake.",
