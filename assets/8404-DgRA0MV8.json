Because alpha-tetralol and beta-tetralol have been shown to be matabolites of tetralin, it may be that reported differences in the susceptibility of different species to the cataractogenic effects of tetralin depend on differences in their metabolism of the compound."

Urine samples were collected for 48 hr and analyzed for metabolites. The rats were killed at the end of the exposure period and the kidneys were removed. One kidney was taken for histopathological examination. The other was homogenized and the homogenates were analyzed for metabolites. Six urinary metabolites were identified; no metabolites were detected in the kidney homogenates. Histopathological changes included increased amounts of cytoplasmic hyaline droplets in proximal convoluted tubular epithelial cells and cellular degeneration in the proximal convoluted tubules. No intratubular cellular casts, overt glomerular changes, or significant inflammation was observed. It was concluded that with the exception of 2-tetralol, all of the urinary tetralin metabolites show that oxidation has occurred on the carbon atoms of the saturated ring closest to the aromatic ring. Tetralin induces the classical lesions of hydrocarbon induced nephropathy."
