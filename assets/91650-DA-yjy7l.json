    "Description": "Pyrimethanil is a member of the class of aminopyrimidines that is N-phenylpyrimidin-2-amine carrying two additional methyl substituents at positions 4 and 6. A fungicide used to control grey mould on fruit, vegetables and ornamentals as well as leaf scab on pome fruit. Also commonly employed to control Botrytis cinerea throughout the winemaking process in grapes, must, fermenting must and wine. It has a role as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aminopyrimidine, a secondary amino compound and an anilinopyrimidine fungicide.",

            "content": "The present study aimed to investigate the distribution and migration of eleven systemic and non-systemic pesticides between the skin and pulp of apples. It also examined the behavior of these pesticides during thermal processes ranging from 40\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C in two apple varieties. Gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed for analytical investigations. Variations in pesticide concentrations between the pulp and skin were observed depending on the apple variety. Pirimicarb showed the highest transfer to the pulp, while boscalid and deltamethrin remained predominantly on the skin. Surprisingly, boscalid was found to be more present in the apple skin than in the pulp. Drying and dry pasteurization processes were the most effective in reducing pesticide levels in apples with and without skin, respectively. Thermal processes resulted in processing factors ranging from 0.06 to 0.98 for ten pesticides, with acetamiprid being the only pesticide whose levels were not decreased. The study discussed the relationship between pesticide distribution, behavior, and physico-chemical properties, particularly water solubility. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pesticide efficacy and removal in apples.",

Fungicide residue analysis was based on a whole fruit assay. Washing and brushing did not significantly remove pyrimethanil residues, even after the fruit had been stored for 7 months in CA. The results from the bioassays on fungicide residues in fruit flesh clearly indicate that pyrimethanil is able to move within the fruit flesh to the seed cavity area and that residues of pyrimethanil in apple fruit flesh can last for several months under conditions commercially used for storage of apples, explaining why pyrimethanil residue was not significantly removed by washing and brushing. Persistence of pyrimethanil residues has also been observed on other fruit crops (1,2). Angioni et al. (2) reported that residues of pyrimethanil in strawberries cannot be removed by home tap water washing. These results indicate that pyrimethanil has some level of systemic activity in these fruit crops, at least in apple fruit as documented in this study.",
