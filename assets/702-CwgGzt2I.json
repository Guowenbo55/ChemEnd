            "Value": "... Ethanol is known to affect a large number of membrane proteins that participate in signaling pathways such as neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, and there is extensive evidence that ethanol interacts with a variety of neurotransmitters. The major actions of ethanol involve enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at GABAa receptors and blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate, an excitatory amine acid (EAA) receptor. Animal studies indicate that the acute effects of ethanol result from competitive inhibition of glycine binding to NMDA receptor and disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission by inhibiting the response of the NMDA receptor. Persistent glycine antagonism and attenuation of glutamatergic neurotransmission by chronic ethanol exposure results in tolerance to ethanol by enhancing EAA neurotransmission and NMDA receptor upregulation. The latter appears to involve selective increases in NMDA R2B subunit concentrations and other molecular changes in specific brain loci. The abrupt withdrawal of ethanol thus produces a hyperexcitable state that leads to the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and excitotoxic neuronal death. GABA-mediated inhibition, which normally acts to limit excitation, is eliminated during ethanol withdrawal syndrome and further intensifies this excitation. In addition, NMDA receptors function to inhibit the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and mesolimbic structures, which modulate the reinforcing action of addictive xenobiotics such as ethanol. By inhibiting NMDA receptor activity, ethanol could increase dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area and could thus create dependence. Chronic  ethanol administration also results in tolerance, dependence, and an ethanol withdrawal syndrome, mediated, in part, by desensitization and or downregulation of GABAa receptors."

            "Value": "The development of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) requires that a combination of physical and physiologic events occur. The normal response to starvation and depletion of hepatic glycogen stores is for amino acids to be converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate can serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, be converted to acetyl-CoA, which can enter the Krebs cycle or can be utilized in various biosynthetic pathways (eg, fatty acid, ketone bodies, cholesterol, and acetylcholine) ... Ethanol metabolism generates NADH, resulting in an excess of reducing potential. This high redox state favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, diverting pyruvate from being a substrate for gluconeogenesis. To compensate for the lack of normal metabolic substrates, the body mobilizes fat from adipose tissue and increased fatty acid metabolism as an alternative source of energy. This response is mediated by a decrease in insulin and an increased secretion of glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone, and cortisol. Fatty acid metabolism results in the formation of acetyl-CoA and it combines with the excess acetate that is generated from ethanol metabolism to form acetoacetate. Most of the acetoacetate is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate due to the excess reducing potential or high redox state of the cell. Volume depletion interferes with the renal elimination of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and contributes to the acidosis. An elevated lactate concentration may result from shunting from pyruvate or from hypoperfusion or infection that may coexist with the underlying ketoacidosis."

            "Value": "Adenosine may mediate many of the acute and chronic motor effects of ethanol on the brain. Ethanol, probably through its metabolite, acetate, prevents adenosine uptake, raising synaptic adenosine concentrations. Excessive stimulation of several adenosine receptors in the cerebellum may explain much of the motor impairment from low ethanol concentrations. In fact, animals made tolerant to ethanol develop cross-tolerance to adenosine agonists. In mice, adenosine receptor agonists increase ethanol-induced incoordination while adenosine antagonists decrease this intoxicating response."

            "Value": "Chronic ethanol (alcohol) administration has been associated with alterations in the binding and function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. To evaluate the mechanism underlying these changes, /the authors/ measured the steady state levels of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits of the GABAA receptor after chronic ethanol administration to rats and ethanol withdrawal for 24 hr. The results indicated that chronic ethanol administration resulted in a 61% decline in the level of the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs [3.8 and 4.3 kilobases (kb)] in the cerebral cortex in rats. The levels of the alpha 2 subunit mRNAs (6 and 3 kb) and the alpha 5 subunit mRNA (2.8 kb) were also reduced, by 61, 45, and 51%, respectively, whereas there was no change in the level of the alpha 3 subunit mRNA (3 kb). Furthermore, the ethanol-induced decrease in receptor mRNA levels persisted for 24 hr, after withdrawal of ethanol and returned to control values at 36 hr of withdrawal. alpha 1 mRNA levels in cerebellum also decreased by 28%. The level of the alpha 6 subunit mRNA, which selectively encodes Ro15-4513 binding sites, was found to be increased by approximately 76% in the cerebellum. Also, the photoaffinity labeling studies using [3H]Ro15-4513 indicated an increase in the levels of various protein components of the GABAA receptor, in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex (e.g., 50- and 55-kDa proteins in the cerebellum and 41- and 50-kDa proteins in the cortex), after chronic ethanol treatment. The increase in alpha 6 mRNA in the cerebellum might be related to the increased labeling of the 55-kDa (approximately 56-kDa) protein and partially responsible for the increased binding ... . Because the alpha 6 subunit is not expressed in cortex, involvement of an as yet unknown subunit in this region cannot be ruled out. The effect of chronic ethanol treatment appears to be specific for GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs, because the same treatment did not alter the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase mRNA or poly(A)+ RNA. In summary, these data indicate that chronic ethanol treatment results in an alteration in the regulation of expression of GABAA receptor subunit-encoding mRNAs, which could be due to alterations in transcription or mRNA stability."

To further define the molecular pathway regulating ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, /the authors/ analyzed the effects of acute ethanol exposure on cerebellar internal granule cell neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Ethanol produced extensive Bax-dependent caspase-3 activation and neuron apoptosis in the cerebellar internal granule cell layer, which was maximal at approximately 6 hours postadministration. This effect was recapitulated in vitro and required new gene transcription, protein translation, Bax expression, and caspase activation. Ethanol-induced neuron death was independent of p53 expression and was unaffected by deficiency in the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bid or Bad.

Binge drinking may exert cardiac toxicity and interfere with heart function, manifested as impaired ventricular contractility, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly defined. ALDH2 transgenic mice were produced using the chicken beta-actin promoter. Wild-type FVB (friend virus B) and ALDH2 mice were challenged with ethanol (3 g/kg, intraperitoneally), and cardiac function was assessed 24 hr later using the Langendroff and cardiomyocyte edge-detection systems. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein phosphatase 2A and 2C (PP2A and PP2C), phosphorylation of Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the transcription factors Foxo3 (Thr32 and Ser413). ALDH2 reduced ethanol-induced elevation in cardiac acetaldehyde levels. Acute ethanol challenge deteriorated myocardial and cardiomyocyte contractile function evidenced by reduction in maximal velocity of pressure development and decline (+/-dP/dt), left ventricular developed pressure, cell shortening, and prolonged relengthening duration, the effects of which were alleviated by ALDH2. Ethanol treatment dampened phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK associated with up-regulated PP2A and PP2C, which was abrogated by ALDH2. ALDH2 significantly attenuated ethanol-induced decrease in Akt- and AMPK-stimulated phosphorylation of Foxo3 at Thr32 and Ser413, respectively. Consistently, ALDH2 rescued ethanol-induced myocardial apoptosis, protein damage, and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. /The/ results suggest that ALDH2 is cardioprotective against acute ethanol toxicity, possibly through inhibition of protein phosphatases, leading to enhanced Akt and AMPK activation, and subsequently, inhibition of Foxo3, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction."

The ethanol-induced inactivation of antioxidant enzymes resulted in the cellular oxidative damage and modulation of redox status as well as mitochondrial dysfunction in HepG2 cells. The cytoxicity of ethanol and inactivation of antioxidant enzymes were effectively protected by manganeses(III) tetrakis(N-methyl-2-pyridyl) porphyrin, a manganese SOD mimetic, and N'-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.

Approximately 50% of burn patients are intoxicated at the time of hospital admission, which increases days on ventilators by 3-fold, and doubles the length of hospitalization, compared to non-intoxicated burn patients. The most common drinking pattern in the United States is binge drinking, where an individual rapidly consumes alcoholic beverages (4 for women, 5 for men) in 2 hr. An estimated 38 million Americans binge drink, often several times per month. Experimental data demonstrate that a single binge-ethanol exposure, prior to scald injury, impairs innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby enhancing infection susceptibility and amplifying pulmonary inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and edema, and is associated with increased mortality. Since these characteristics are similar to those observed in ARDS burn patients, our study objective was to determine whether ethanol intoxication and burn injury and the subsequent pulmonary congestion affect physiological parameters of lung function, using non-invasive and unrestrained plethysmography in a murine model system. Furthermore, to mirror young adult binge-drinking patterns, and to determine the effect of multiple ethanol exposures on pulmonary inflammation, we utilized an episodic binge-ethanol exposure regimen, where mice were exposed to ethanol for a total of 6 days (3 days ethanol, 4 days rest, 3 days ethanol) prior to burn injury. Our analyses demonstrate mice exposed to episodic binge ethanol and burn injury have higher mortality, increased pulmonary congestion and neutrophil infiltration, elevated neutrophil chemoattractants, and respiratory dysfunction, compared to burn or ethanol intoxication alone. Overall, our study identifies plethysmography as a useful tool for characterizing respiratory function in a murine burn model and for future identification of therapeutic compounds capable of restoring pulmonary functionality."

On postnatal day P34 (adolescents) or P69 (adults), rats were habituated to the testing apparatus for 30 min.

Adolescent females maintained aversions to 1 and 1.5 g/kg across days, whereas adult females continued to show an aversion to the 1.5 g/kg dose only. These opposite patterns of sensitivity that emerged among males and females at each age in the propensity to maintain an ethanol-induced taste aversion under social conditions may contribute to age- and sex-related differences in ethanol intake.

Although excessive ethanol consumption may enhance thymocyte apoptosis, reports investigating the autophagic response of the thymus to ethanol toxicity are still lacking. We investigated apoptosis and autophagy in thymi of an animal model of binge ethanol exposure. Adult male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally either with 5 g/kg ethanol or phosphate buffer saline (for the control group) and sacrificed 0, 3, 6 and 24 hours after injection. Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed enhanced formation of TBMs phagocytosing many apoptotic thymocytes in the thymic cortex of the ethanol-treated rats (ETRs), and this formation was particularly marked at 24 hr. The macrophages showed signs of activation under TEM and immunofluorescence double labeling with RM4 (a macrophage marker) and iNOS. Additionally, in comparison to the control group, autophagy was enhanced in ETR thymic TBMs as evidenced ultrastructurally by accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, immunohistochemical increases in LC3 puncta, Western blot analysis of the latter protein, and colocalization of LC3 and RM4 in immunofluorescence double labeling. Immunoelectron microscopy also revealed LC3-labeled autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cell phagosomes in ETR TBMs, suggesting the possibility of LC3-related phagocytosis. This was confirmed by enhanced colocalization of LC3 with lysosomal cathepsins in double labeling. These results indicate that enhanced autophagy in ETR thymic TBMs is not only a cytoprotective mechanism but could also be involved in the clearance of apoptotic thymocytes, thus preventing autoimmune reactions and suppressing inflammatory response."

The aim of this study was to establish a new prognostic model of acute alcohol pancreatitis in rats. To ascertain the effect of continuous infusion of ethanol on each phase, i.e., progression and recovery, in caerulein-induced pancreatic injury in rats, /the authors/ infused a physiological or supramaximal dose of caerulein intravenously to conscious Wistar rats for up to 6 hr (time: 0-6 hr) with or without ethanol infusion for 9 hr (time: 3-12 hr). Ethanol did not induce the pancreatic injury alone or when combined with a physiological dose of caerulein. In the progression phase, ethanol infusion for 3 hr (time: 6 h) did not aggravate the pancreatic injury induced by a supramaximal dose of caerulein in terms of plasma amylase and lipase activities but did increase the pancreatic calcium level. In the recovery phase, however, ethanol infusion for 9 hr (time: 12 hr) significantly restrained the recovery from pancreatic injury as monitored in terms of these activities. Further, ethanol infusion for 9 hr significantly increased the cumulative urinary excretion of amylase from 12 to 27 h but did not do the same from 0 to 12 hr. In the histological evaluation at 27 hr, the induction of acinar cell vacuolization and dilation of the glandular lumina and ducts were significant in the caerulein plus ethanol-treated group. The  findings suggest that ethanol administration delays the recovery rather than worsens the progression in acute pancreatic injury induced by exocrine hyperstimulation..."

This caused an accumulation of secretory vesicles laden with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles which were seen 90 min after administration and later disappeared. Lysosomes and Golgi complex secretory vesicle (GCSV) fractions were isolated. The proteolytic and lipolytic activities of these fractions were measured in order to assess their possible role in the elimination of the initially retained secretory material. There was no change in proteolysis either in lysosomes or in the GCSV-fraction from ethanol-intoxicated rats when measured by the release of degradation products during incubation. Similarly, the activities of acid hydrolases were unaffected by acute ethanol intoxication. On the other hand, lipolysis increased by some 50-100% in the GCSV fraction, whereas the lysosomes displayed unchanged lipolytic levels compared with controls. Ultrastructurally, the GCSV-fraction from ethanol-intoxicated rat livers showed signs of disintegrated VLDL particles. It is concluded that acute ethanol intoxication causes an increase in lipolysis but not in proteolysis in the operationally defined GCSV fraction. Since triacylglycerol lipase activities did not change in the GCSV fraction, increased amounts of substrate seem to cause the enhanced lipolysis observed."

However, because the action of ethanol on gastric acid secretion was proposed to involve the release of histamine, we decided to investigate the effects of ethanol and some alcoholic beverages (red wine and beer) on histamine release from the dog stomach. After performing a splenectomy in anesthetized beagle dogs, the gastrosplenic vein draining the corpus of the stomach was cannulated for blood withdrawal to evaluate the local release of gastrin and histamine by radioimmunoassay. Intragastric administration of 200 mL of beer (4.8% ethanol) or red wine (12.5% ethanol) caused a significant enhancement in gastrin and histamine concentrations in venous blood from the stomach. By contrast, intragastric administration of pure ethanol in distilled water at the same concentrations of wine or beer did not significantly modify gastrin and histamine release. Integrated histamine responses for 20 min to beer and wine paralleled gastrin concentrations and were of the same magnitude of those induced by intravenous infusion of pentagastrin at 1 and 6 ug/kg/hr, respectively. We conclude that: 1) beer and red wine, but not pure ethanol, are potent releasers of histamine; 2) histamine release seems to be related to the gastrin response and probably occurs at the level of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells; 3) the ethanol content of these drinks is not important for their stimulant effect, indicating that some other components of beer and wine are responsible for gastrin and histamine release from the dog stomach."

In this respect, alcohol-preferring (like C57BL/6 mice) and alcohol-avoiding lines (like DBA/2 mice) of animals served as models in the search for neurobiological substrates of excessive ethanol consumption. One of the systems that is thought to be associated with the incidence of alcoholism is the endogenous opioid system. In the first experiment, basal mRNA levels of mu- and delta-opioid receptors, and of opioid-degrading enzymes enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase 24.11; NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the brain regions of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice did not reveal genetically determined differences in these parameters between the two strains. Furthermore, in the brain regions studied, the corresponding enzyme activities of NEP and ACE did not differ significantly between the lines of mice, except for a higher NEP activity in the striatum and olfactory bulb of DBA/2 mice (p < 0.01). In the second experiment, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice were offered a free choice between water and 10% ethanol solution for 4 weeks and were killed thereafter; from another group, ethanol was removed for 3 days and from a third group ethanol was removed for 3 weeks before killing. In the striatum, a highly significant increase in the ACE mRNA amount was detected after 3 weeks of removal of ethanol in C57BL/6 mice, whereas in DBA/2 mice the delta-opioid receptor mRNA level was increased at this time when compared with the corresponding ethanol treatment group. The most striking changes were seen in the hypothalamus, where mu-opioid receptor, ACE, and NEP mRNA amounts markedly decreased after ethanol treatment in both strains. Thus, chronic ethanol intake caused significant changes in the gene expression of distinct components of the endogenous opioid system. These findings further underline an involvement of the opioid system in the effects of ethanol."

Therefore, consumption of alcoholic beverages may have considerably different effects on expression of hepatic microsomal monooxygenases than the relatively selective induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1 observed after consumption of pure ethanol. In the current study, we compared the effects of two beers: lager (a light roasted beer) and stout (a dark roasted beer) with those of an equivalent amount of pure ethanol on hepatic CYP expression. Beer or pure ethanol was part of a complete total enteral nutrition diet that was infused intragastrically into male Sprague Dawley rats for 21 days. At the end of the infusion period, rats were euthanized, and liver and intestinal microsomes were prepared. Expression and activity of CYP1A1/2, CYP2B1, CYP2E1, CYP3A, and CYP4A were assessed by Western immunoblotting and by using CYP enzyme-specific substrates, respectively. mRNA and protein levels of CYP4A1 were elevated only in stout-treated animals. However, lauric acid 12-hydroxylase activity (a CYP4A-specific activity) was reduced (p < or = 0.05) in microsomes from lager- and stout-fed rats. After oxidation with potassium ferricyanide, this activity was significantly increased in microsomes from stout-fed animals. The relative expression of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1 and the activities toward p-nitrophenol, pentoxyresorufin, or benzyloxyresorufin did not differ between beers or compared with pure ethanol or controls. However, the mean expression of CYP1A2, CYP3A, and CYP4A apoproteins was greater in liver microsomes from stout-infused rats than in those from lager-infused rats, ethanol-infused rats, and diet controls (p < or = 0.05). In addition, although no significant differences were observed in ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD), methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (MROD), midazolam, or testosterone hydroxylase activities between groups, stout-infused rats had greater hepatic microsomal erythromycin N-demethylase activity than other groups (p < or = 0.05).

The daily ethanol intake levels for the beer fed and 10% ethanol fed rats were equivalent. In addition, CYP450 spectral features of microsomes from beer fed and ethanol fed rats were markedly different. Spectral examination of microsomes from beer fed rats revealed that about 40% of the total CYP450 content existed in the form of a metabolic intermediate (MI) complex, while no evidence was found for MI complex formation in microsomes of ethanol fed rats."

Autophagy and lysosome biogenesis are linked. Both are regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Here, we tested whether TFEB can be used as a singular indicator of autophagic activity, by quantifying its nuclear content in livers of mice subjected to acute and chronic EtOH administration. We correlated nuclear TFEB to specific indices of autophagy. In acute experiments, we gavaged GFP-LC3(tg) mice with a single dose of EtOH or with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We fed mice chronically by feeding them control or EtOH liquid diets. Compared with PBS-gavaged controls, livers of EtOH-gavaged mice exhibited greater autophagosome (AV) numbers, a higher incidence of AV-lysosome co-localization, and elevated levels of free GFP, all indicating enhanced autophagy, which correlated with a higher nuclear content of TFEB. Compared with pair-fed controls, livers of EtOH-fed mice exhibited higher AV numbers, but had lower lysosome numbers, lower AV-lysosome co-localization, higher P62/SQSTM1 levels, and lower free GFP levels. The latter findings correlated with lower nuclear TFEB levels in EtOH-fed mice. Thus, enhanced autophagy after acute EtOH gavage correlated with a higher nuclear TFEB content. Conversely, chronic EtOH feeding inhibited hepatic autophagy, associated with a lower nuclear TFEB content. Our findings suggest that the effect of acute EtOH gavage on hepatic autophagy differs significantly from that after chronic EtOH feeding. Each regimen distinctly affects TFEB localization, which in turn, regulates hepatic autophagy and lysosome biogenesis."

Moreover, all evidence for a pro-carcinogenic role of ethanol in colorectal cancer is derived from correlations observed in epidemiological studies or from rodent studies with additional carcinogen application or tumor suppressor gene inactivation. In the current study, wild-type mice and mice with depletion of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1b1 (Aldh1b1), an enzyme which has been proposed to play an important role in acetaldehyde detoxification in the intestines, received ethanol in drinking water for 1 year. Long-term ethanol consumption led to intestinal tumor development in wild-type and Aldh1b1-depleted mice, but no intestinal tumors were observed in water-treated controls. Moreover, a significant increase in DNA damage was detected in the large intestinal epithelium of ethanol-treated mice of both genotypes compared with the respective water-treated groups, along with increased proliferation of the small and large intestinal epithelium. Aldh1b1 depletion led to increased plasma acetaldehyde levels in ethanol-treated mice, to a significant aggravation of ethanol-induced intestinal hyperproliferation, and to more advanced features of intestinal tumors, but it did not affect intestinal tumor incidence. These data indicate that ethanol consumption can initiate intestinal tumorigenesis without any additional carcinogen treatment or tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and we provide evidence for a role of Aldh1b1 in protection of the intestines from ethanol-induced damage, as well as for both carcinogenic and tumor-promoting functions of acetaldehyde, including increased progression of ethanol-induced tumors."

Risk shows a striking correlation with the content of higher alcohols in the drinks, although the alcohols per se have not been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. To test the concept that higher alcohols modulate the esophageal carcinogenicity of nitrosamines by altering their metabolism, we studied the effect of certain higher alcohols on the metabolism of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine by rat esophageal mucosal and liver microsomes. In esophagus, the alcohols were 1000 times more inhibitory than ethanol, and in liver 100 times. This suggests that enhancement of carcinogenesis may not result from an effect on nitrosamine metabolism. Higher alcohols could act by increasing the rate of replication of cells already initiated for malignancy by previous exposure to nitrosamines. Intubation of 2-methylbutanol produces a very much greater increase in esophageal basal-cell proliferation than does ethanol."

Embryonic ethanol exposure (3-24 hours post fertilization, hpf) led to defects in atrio-ventricular (AV) valvulogenesis beginning around 37 hpf, a morphogenetic event that arises long after ethanol withdrawal. Valve leaflets of the control embryos comprised two layers of cells confined at the compact atrio-ventricular canal (AVC). Ethanol treated embryos had extended AVC and valve forming cells were found either as rows of cells spanning the AVC or as unorganized clusters near the AV boundary. Ethanol exposure reduced valve precursors at the AVC, but some ventricular cells in ethanol treated embryos exhibited few characteristics of valve precursors. Late staged larvae and juvenile fish exposed to ethanol during embryonic development had faulty AV valves. Examination of AVC morphogenesis regulatory networks revealed that early ethanol exposure disrupted the Bmp signaling gradient in the heart during valve formation. Bmp signaling was prominent at the AVC in controls, but ethanol-exposed embryos displayed active Bmp signaling throughout the ventricle. Ethanol exposure also led to mislocalization of Notch signaling cells in endocardium during AV valve formation. Normally, highly active Notch signaling cells were organized at the AVC. In ethanol-exposed embryos, highly active Notch signaling cells were dispersed throughout the ventricle. At later stages, ethanol-exposed embryos exhibited reduced Wnt/beta-catenin activity at the AVC.

The ethanol-fed rats showed cytoplasmic mitochondrial atrophy and vacuolar structures of the epithelial cells of the distal tubules and collecting ducts not seen in control rats. No obvious difference was found in the glomerular, proximal tubule, or loop of Henle architecture between the two groups. These findings suggest that rats prenatally exposed to ethanol have renal ultrastructural abnormalities that may be important in the genesis of functional disturbances."

While the toxic potential of developmental EtOH exposure is well characterized clinically, the effect of timing on the extent of toxicity remains unknown. Fish models such as the Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, provide a convenient system for investigating the effects of developmental EtOH exposure in vivo. In this study, medaka embryo toxicity tests were used to assess temporal variations in developmental EtOH toxicity. Fertilized eggs were collected and incubated during early, middle or late egg development (e.g., 0-3, 3-6 or 6-9 days post-fertilization) with various sub-lethal concentrations of EtOH [0.1% (17.2 mM), 0.5% (86.0 mM) or 1% (172 mM)]. Uptake of EtOH by the embryo was 60-68% of the solution concentration across all windows. Time to hatch, head width, total body length and whole embryo caspase activity were used to assess toxicity. Hatching delays were noted only at the highest concentration of EtOH. Head width was affected at all ethanol levels, regardless of the window of exposure. EtOH-induced decreases in body length, however, appeared to be most pronounced when exposure occurred either during the first or last window. The effect on caspase-3/7 activity also depended on the window of exposure, with increases in caspase noted in embryos treated on days 1 or 2 (first window) and decreases seen in embryos treated on day 6 (second window) or day 8 (third window). In general, these data suggest that critical periods for heightened sensitivity to developmental EtOH exposure may vary according to the specific endpoint used to assess toxicity."

In the present report /the authors/ utilize total enteral nutrition (TEN) to specifically understand the roles of nutrition and caloric intake in EtOH-induced fetal toxicity. Time-impregnated rats were intragastrically fed either control or diets containing EtOH (8-14 g/kg/day) at a recommended caloric intake for pregnant rats or rats 30% undernourished, from gestation day (GD) 6-20. Decreased fetal weight and litter size (P < 0.05) and increased full litter resorptions (33% vs. 0%), were observed in undernourished dams compared to adequately fed rats given the same dose of EtOH, while undernutrition alone did not produce any fetal toxicity. Undernutrition led to impairment of EtOH metabolism, increased blood EtOH concentrations (160%), and decreased maternal hepatic ADH1 mRNA, protein, and activity. Microarray analyses of maternal hepatic gene expression on GD15 revealed that 369 genes were altered by EtOH in the presence of undernutrition, as compared to only 37 genes by EtOH per se (+/-2-fold, P < 0.05). Hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analysis revealed that stress and external stimulus responses, transcriptional regulation, cellular homeostasis, and protein metabolism were affected uniquely in the EtOH-under-nutrition group, but not by EtOH alone. Microarray data were confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. Undernourished EtOH-fed animals had 2-fold lower IGF-1 mRNA and 10-fold lower serum IGF-1 protein levels compared to undernourished controls (P < 0.0005). Examination of maternal GH signaling via STAT5a and -5b revealed significant reduction in both gene and protein expression produced by both EtOH and undernutrition. However, despite significantly elevated fetal BECs, fetal IGF-1 mRNA and protein were not affected by EtOH or EtOH-undernutrition combinations. Our data suggest that undernutrition potentiates the fetal toxicity of EtOH in part by disrupting maternal GH-IGF-1, signaling thereby decreasing maternal uterine capacity and placental growth."

Oxidative metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase or cytochrome P450 2E1 has been implicated in some of ethanol's teratogenic effects, either via production of acetaldehyde or competitive inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis. Generalized oxidative stress in response to ethanol may also play a role in its teratogenicity. Among the developmental defects that ethanol has been implicated in is holoprosencephaly, a failure to define the midline of the forebrain and midface that is associated with a deficiency in Sonic hedgehog pathway function. Etiologically, holoprosencephaly is thought to arise from a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. We have developed a gene-environment interaction model of holoprosencephaly in mice, in which mutation of the Sonic hedgehog coreceptor, Cdon, synergizes with transient in utero exposure to ethanol. This system was used to address whether oxidative metabolism is required for ethanol's teratogenic activity in holoprosencephaly. We report here that t-butyl alcohol, which is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenases or Cyp2E1, is a potent inducer of holoprosencephaly in Cdon mutant mice. Additionally, antioxidant treatment did not prevent ethanol- or t-butyl alcohol-induced HPE in these mice. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that ethanol itself, rather than a consequence of its metabolism, is a holoprosencephaly-inducing teratogen."

Male rats were submitted to 6 months of ethanol treatment followed by a 2-month withdrawal period. Stereological methods were applied to estimate the total number of microglia and activated microglia detected by CD11b immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal formation. The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, COX-2 and IL-15 were measured by qRT-PCR. Alcohol consumption was associated with an increase in the total number of activated microglia but morphological assessment indicated that microglia did not exhibit a full activation phenotype. These data were supported by functional evidence since chronic alcohol consumption produced no changes in the expression of TNF-alpha or COX-2. The levels of IL-15 a cytokine whose expression is increased upon activation of both astrocytes and microglia, was induced by chronic alcohol treatment. Importantly, the partial activation of microglia induced by ethanol was not reversed by long-term withdrawal.

Along with their role in addiction, nAChRs also contribute to motor control circuitry. The alpha-7 nAChR subtype is highly expressed in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a brainstem cholinergic center that contributes to motor performance through its projections to thalamic motor relay centers, including the mediodorsal thalamus. We demonstrate that EtOH concentrations just above the legal limits for intoxication in humans can inhibit alpha-7 nAChRs in LDTg neurons from rats. This EtOH-induced inhibition is mediated by a decrease in cAMP/PKA signaling. The alpha-7 nAChR-positive allosteric modulator PNU120596 [N-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N'-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)-urea], which interferes with receptor desensitization, completely eliminated EtOH modulation of these receptors. These data suggest that EtOH inhibits alpha-7 responses through a PKA-dependent enhancement of receptor desensitization. EtOH also inhibited the effects of nicotine at presynaptic alpha-7 nAChRs on glutamate terminals in the mediodorsal thalamus. In vivo administration of PNU120596 either into the cerebral ventricles or directly into the mediodorsal thalamus attenuated EtOH-induced motor impairment. Thus, alpha-7 nAChRs are likely important mediators of the motor impairing effects of moderate EtOH consumption. The motor-impairing effects of ethanol contribute to intoxication-related injury and death. Here we explore the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced motor impairment. Physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibit activity of a nicotinic receptor subtype that is expressed in brain areas associated with motor control.

We analyzed the impact of chronic (18 two-bottle choice intake sessions spread across 42 days, session length: 18 hr) ethanol [or only vehicle (control group)] self-administration during adolescence or adulthood on the induction of deltaFosB in several brain areas, anxiety-like behavior, and ethanol-induced locomotor activity and conditioned place preference (CPP) in Wistar rats. Adolescent rats exhibited a progressive escalation of ethanol intake and preference, whereas adult rats exhibited a stable pattern of ingestion. Few behavioral differences in the open field or light-dark test were observed after the intake test. Furthermore, ethanol self-administration did not promote the expression of ethanol-induced CPP. There were, however, large age-related differences in the neural consequences of ethanol drinking: a significantly greater number of ethanol-induced deltaFosB-positive cells was found in adolescents vs. adults in the prelimbic cortex, dorsolateral striatum, nucleus accumbens core and shell, and central amygdala nucleus capsular and basolateral amygdala, with sex-related differences found at central amygdala. This greater ethanol-induced deltaFosB induction may represent yet another age-related difference in the sensitivity to ethanol that may put adolescents at higher risk for problematic ethanol use."

Rat dams were exposed for 6.5 hr daily to the vapors at concentrations of 0, 3000, 6000, or 9000 ppm in inhalation chambers from gestational day (GD) 9 through 20. Cage controls (offspring of non-exposed dams that remained in the animal facility during these exposures) were also assessed in the E0 experiment, but showed no consistent differences from the offspring of air-exposed controls. Offspring were tested as adults with trace fear conditioning, Morris water maze, or appetitive operant responding. With fear conditioning, no significant effects were observed on cue or context learning. In the water maze, there were no differences in place learning or escaping to a visible platform. However, during the reference memory probe (no platform) male rats exposed prenatally to E85 vapor (6000 and 9000 ppm) failed to show a bias for the target quadrant. Across studies, females (treated and some controls) were less consistent in this measure. Males showed no differences during match-to-place learning (platform moved each day) in any experiment and females showed only transient differences in latency and path length in the E0 experiment. Similarly, no differences were observed in delayed match-to-sample operant performance of E0 males or females; thus, this test was not used to evaluate effects of E15 or E85 vapors. During choice reaction time assessments (only males were tested) decision and movement times were unimpaired by any prenatal exposure, while anticipatory responses were increased by vapors of E0 (9000 ppm) and E15 (6000 and 9000 ppm), and the latter group also showed reduced accuracy. E85 vapors did not disrupt any choice reaction time measure. Finally, no response inhibition deficit was observed in a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) response schedule in males or females in the E15 or E85 experiments. In summary, prenatal exposure to these fuel blends produced few deficits in adult offspring on these cognitive tests. Significant effects found during a water maze probe trial and choice reaction time tests were observed at vapor concentrations of 6000 ppm or higher, a concentration that is 4-6 orders of magnitude higher than those associated with normal automotive fueling operations and garages. Similar effects were not consistently observed in a previous study of inhaled ethanol, and thus these effects cannot be attributed to the concentration of ethanol in the mixture."

Electrophysiological measurements showed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in pyramidal neurons from the ethanol group.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic maternal ethanol (EtOH) consumption during pregnancy and lactation on glutamatergic transmission regulation, energy deficit, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of the offspring. EtOH was administered to dams in drinking water at increasing doses (2 to 20%) from the gestation day 5 to lactation day 21. EtOH and tap water intake by treated and control groups, respectively, were measured daily. Results showed that EtOH exposure does not affect fluid intake over the course of pregnancy and lactation. The toxicity of maternal exposure to EtOH was demonstrated by decreased offspring body weight at experimental age, on postnatal day 21. Moreover, maternal EtOH exposure decreased (45) Ca(2+) influx in the offspring's hippocampus. Corroborating this finding, EtOH increased both Na(+) -dependent and Na(+) -independent glial [(14) C]-glutamate uptake in hippocampus of immature rats. Also, maternal EtOH exposure decreased glutamine synthetase activity and induced aspartate aminotransferase enzymatic activity, suggesting that in EtOH-exposed offspring hippocampus, glutamate is preferentially used as a fuel in tricarboxylic acid cycle instead of being converted into glutamine. In addition, EtOH exposure decreased [U-14C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in offspring hippocampus. The decline in glucose transport coincided with increased lactate dehydrogenase activity, suggesting an adaptative response in EtOH-exposed offspring hippocampus, using lactate as an alternative fuel. These events were associated with oxidative damage, as demonstrated by changes in the enzymatic antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation. Taken together, the results demonstrate that maternal exposure to EtOH during pregnancy and lactation impairs glutamatergic transmission, as well as inducing oxidative stress and energy deficit in immature rat hippocampus."

In the present study, we tested the same cohort of mice in an open field as juveniles on postnatal day (PD) 23-25 and as young adults on PD65-67 for prenatal ethanol effects on exploration and emotionality with measures of activity, rearing, grooming and defecation. We evaluated the effects of dose, sex, day of treatment and day of birth by multiple regression analyses. We found that, compared to the respective gavage controls, juvenile mice that had been prenatally exposed to the low BEC on either GD7 or GD8 were significantly hypoactive on the first 2 test days, reared significantly more on the last 2 test days, and groomed and defecated significantly more on all 3 test days. Only mice that had been treated on GD7 remained hypoactive as adults. Juvenile mice prenatally exposed to the moderate BEC on GD7 groomed significantly more, while those exposed on GD8 reared and defecated significantly more. Sex differences were highly significant in adult control mice, with control males less active and more emotional than females. Similar, but smaller, sex differences were also evident in adults exposed to ethanol prenatally. Persistence into later life of a deleterious effect of premature birth (i.e., birth on GD19 rather than GD20) on weight and behavior was not consistently supported by these data. Importantly, mice shown previously to be delayed in sensorimotor development as neonates, in the present study demonstrated hypoactivity and increased emotionality in open field behaviors as juveniles, and those mice exposed during gastrulation remained hypoactive as adults. Thus, we propose that the delayed motor development, hypoactivity and emotionality we observed in mice exposed to a low BEC during gastrulation or neurulation may relate to an attention deficit-activity disorder in humans, possibly the inattentive subtype, or Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT). We further discuss concerns about occasional light or moderate alcohol consumption during the 3rd or 4th week of human pregnancy."

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying attention deficits in FASD are not well understood. We show here that after developmental binge-pattern ethanol exposure, adult mice exhibit impaired performance on the five-choice serial reaction time test for visual attention, with lower accuracy during initial training and a higher rate of omissions under challenging conditions of high attention demand. Whole-cell electrophysiology experiments in these same mice find dysregulated pyramidal neurons in layer VI of the medial prefrontal cortex, which are critical for normal attention performance. Layer VI neurons show decreased intrinsic excitability and increased responses to stimulation of both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors.

Mice were selected from a prenatal ethanol exposure (PAE) cohort that had been tested as neonates for their sensorimotor development and as juveniles and young adults for open field activity levels and emotionality. Mice exposed on either of the two gestational days to acute, low or moderate levels of ethanol were deficient in overall performance in the RAM in adulthood. Importantly, mice in ethanol exposed groups took longer to reach criterion in the RAM, and many mice in these groups failed to do so after 48 trials when testing was terminated. Exposure to a low level of ethanol on either GD7 or GD8, or a moderate level on GD7, resulted in significant impairment in spatial reference (long-term) memory, while only mice exposed on GD7 to the low level of ethanol were significantly impaired in spatial working (short-term) memory. Mice exposed to the low ethanol level on either day had significantly shorter response latencies, which may reflect impairment of processes related to response inhibition or executive attention in these mice. For all measures, distributions of individual scores revealed a relatively small subset of mice in each PAE group who scored well outside the range of the control group, which skewed the population distributions to varying degrees in the direction of worse performance for the PAE groups. Overall the data suggest that after acute, low level ethanol exposure early in gestation, the likelihood that an individual mouse embryo experienced measureable ill-effects due to the exposure was rather low, but in a few of the embryos, damage occurred that resulted in significant deficits in later performance. The overall characteristics of our cohort of PAE mice, including delayed sensorimotor development, mild hypoactivity and increased emotionality, as shown in previous studies, together with deficits in spatial learning and memory as shown here, resemble those in a subset of human Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) diagnoses, specifically ADHD-Inattentive type (ADHD-I) and/or Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT).

A large body of evidence shows that ethanol produces multiple abnormalities in the developing central nervous system (CNS), such as smaller brain size, reduced volume of cerebral white matter, permanent loss of neurons, and alterations in synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis. The effects of ethanol on the developing spinal cord, however, receive little attention and remain unclear. We used a third trimester equivalent mouse model to investigate the effect of ethanol on the developing spinal cord. Ethanol caused apoptosis and neurodegeneration in the dorsal horn neurons of mice of early postnatal days, which was accompanied by glial activation, macrophage infiltration, and increased expression of CCR2, a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). Ethanol-induced neuronal death during development resulted in permanent loss of spinal cord neurons in adult mice. Ethanol stimulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, and activated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Knocking out MCP-1 or CCR2 made mice resistant to ethanol-induced apoptosis, ER stress, glial activation, and activation of GSK3beta and JNK. CCR2 knock out offered much better protection against ethanol-induced damage to the spinal cord. Thus, developmental ethanol exposure caused permanent loss of spinal cord neurons and CCR2 signaling played an important role in ethanol neurotoxicity."

Survived embryos were maintained in clean ERM and used either for gene expression analysis on 2- and 6-dpf or allowed to hatch for behavioral study. Photomotor response of 3-4 day post hatch larvae were tracked for 3 hr with light-dark transitions. It was observed that larval swimming was phototactic; enhanced in presence of light, declined in dark. Phototactic response was also observed in larvae prenatally exposed to ethanol or 5-azaC; however, the total distance swum by these larvae compared to controls declined. Further analysis indicated that, in light phases, total swimming activity and average swimming speed were reduced in larvae prenatally exposed to ethanol (300 mM) or 5-azaC. Expression analysis of baz1a and baz2a in embryos indicated developmental regulation. Ethanol (100-300 mM) or 5-azaC (2 mM) were able to modulate downregulation of both baz1a and baz2a mRNAs only in 6 dpf embryos of 300 mM ethanol and 5-azaC (2 mM) groups. These studies indicated that prenatal exposure to ethanol or 5-azaC was able to disrupt movements and thus swimming behavior in FASD phenotypes probably due to delayed remodeling of genome and epigenome."

Our objective was to evaluate factors affecting the reward value of low alcohol doses and risk factors for increasing alcohol doses due to reward progression caused by alcohol exposure patterns. We thus performed conditioned place preference (CPP) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced locomotor sensitization tests in mice. Low-dose EtOH (0.5 or 1 g/kg twice/week)-induced CPP was stronger than that produced by saline control treatment, but the effect decreased with increasing numbers of conditioning trials. Moderate-dose/long-term EtOH exposure induced a weaker CPP than high-dose/short-term EtOH (2 g/kg twice/week) exposure with the same total EtOH dose (8 g/kg/experiment). Acamprosate calcium, an anti-relapse drug, preclusively reduced EtOH-induced CPP. EtOH induced CPP and locomotor sensitization in black but not white chamber, although the initial preference and the basal locomotion in each chamber were equal. Therefore, the brightness of the chamber had an effect on EtOH-induced sensitization. Moreover, additional studies indicated that EtOH-induced locomotor sensitization also depends on the dose but not the administration interval. Paired associative learning with EtOH exposure is a potent factor influencing the level of reward produced by EtOH. Moreover, exposure to high doses of alcohol, even on an intermittent schedule, carries a higher risk of addiction than exposure to moderate doses over longer periods."

In one task, subjects acquired a new 3-response sequence (acquisition), whereas in the other task, subjects completed a well-rehearsed 3-response sequence (performance). Both tasks though could be completed using an identical response topography and used the same sensory stimuli and schedule of reinforcement. More important, comparing neural patterns during sequence acquisition to those during sequence performance allows for a subtractive approach whereby activity associated with learning could potentially be dissociated from the activity associated with ongoing behavior. At sites where CA1 activity was closely associated with behavior, the patterns of activity were differentially modulated by key position and the serial position of a response within the schedule of reinforcement. Temporal shifts between peak activity and responding on particular keys also occurred during sequence acquisition, but not during sequence performance. Ethanol disrupted CA1 activity while producing rate-decreasing effects in both tasks and error-increasing effects that were more selective for sequence acquisition than sequence performance. Ethanol also produced alterations in the magnitude of modulations and temporal pattern of CA1 activity, although these effects were not selective for sequence acquisition. Similar to ethanol, hippocampal micro-stimulation decreased response rate in both tasks and selectively increased the percentage of errors during sequence acquisition, and provided a more direct demonstration of hippocampal involvement during sequence acquisition. Together, these results strongly support the notion that ethanol disrupts sequence acquisition by disrupting hippocampal activity and that the hippocampus is necessary for the conditioned associations required for sequence acquisition."

The 2 modes of exposure were equivalent in the magnitude of their effects. Human adolescents, however, are likely to experience the drug in a social setting as both an EtOH observer and demonstrator. That is, both interacting with an intoxicated peer and experiencing EtOH's postingestive consequences in conjunction with hematogenic olfaction. Therefore, we tested whether combined adolescent exposure as both an observer and demonstrator differed from either form of individual experience. Beginning on postnatal day (P) 29, naive rats received EtOH or water exposures in a social interaction paradigm as either an observer, a demonstrator, or combined experience (where each animal in the interaction was, itself, an observer and demonstrator). Exposures occurred 4 times, once every 48 hours. On P37, the reflexive behavioral response to EtOH odor was tested, using whole-body plethysmography.

Moreover, combined exposure as both an EtOH observer and demonstrator significantly differed from either form of individual EtOH experience. EtOH's component chemosensory qualities are known to be central contributors to its acceptance and increases in the acceptability of EtOH's odor, resulting from a social transmission experience, are predictive of enhanced EtOH avidity in adolescence. Our findings demonstrate that combined exposure as an observer and demonstrator, within a socially relevant framework, may represent a higher risk scenario for increased EtOH avidity in adolescence (and by extension adult persistence) as compared to the individual effects of direct ingestion or social experience with the drug."

There is thus a possible link between the hypophyseal-pituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioral actions of developmental ethanol exposure. ..."

Relatively little is known, however, about age-related differences in stress modulation of ethanol drinking or stress modulation of ethanol-induced sedation and hypnosis. We observed that chronic restraint stress transiently exacerbated free-choice ethanol drinking in adolescent, but not in adult, rats. Restraint stress altered exploration patterns of a light-dark box apparatus in adolescents and adults. Stressed animals spent significantly more time in the white area of the maze and made significantly more transfers between compartments than their non-stressed peers. Behavioral response to acute stress, on the other hand, was modulated by prior restraint stress only in adults. Adolescents, unlike adults, exhibited ethanol-induced motor stimulation in an open field. Stress increased the duration of loss of the righting reflex after a high ethanol dose, yet this effect was similar at both ages. Ethanol-induced sleep time was much higher in adult than in adolescent rats, yet stress diminished ethanol-induced sleep time only in adults. The study indicates age-related differences that may increase the risk for initiation and escalation in alcohol drinking."

Another aim was to determine whether AIE alone or in combination with stress influenced intake of a sweetened ethanol solution (Experiment 1) or a sweetened solution (\"supersac\") alone (Experiment 2) under social circumstances. Animals were exposed to restraint on P66-P70 (90 min/day) or left nonstressed, with corticosterone (CORT) levels assessed on day 1 and day 5 in Experiment 2. Social anxiety-like behavior emerged after AIE in non-stressed males, but not females, whereas stress-induced social anxiety was evident only in water-exposed males and females. Adult-typical habituation of the CORT response to repeated restraint was not evident in adult animals after AIE, a lack of habituation reminiscent of that normally evident in adolescents. Neither AIE nor stress affected ethanol intake under social circumstances, although AIE and restraint independently increased adolescent-typical play fighting in males during social drinking. Among males, the combination of AIE and restraint suppressed \"supersac\" intake; this index of depression-like behavior was not seen in females. The results provide experimental evidence associating adolescent alcohol exposure, later stress, anxiety, and depression, with young adolescent males being particularly vulnerable to long-lasting adverse effects of repeated ethanol. ..."

Alcohol is bidirectionally linked to TBI as many TBI patients are intoxicated at the time of their injury and we recently reported that, in accordance with human epidemiological data, animals injured during juvenile development self-administered significantly more alcohol as adults than did sham injured mice. There are also clinical data that drinking after TBI significantly reduces the efficacy of rehabilitation and leads to poorer long-term outcomes. In order to determine whether juvenile traumatic brain injury also increased the vulnerability of the brain to the toxic effects of high dose alcohol, mice were injured at 21days of age and then seven weeks later treated daily with binge-like levels of alcohol 5g/kg (by oral gavage) for ten days. Binge-like alcohol produced a greater degree of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation in mice that sustained a TBI. Further, mice that sustained a juvenile TBI exhibited mild learning and memory impairments in adulthood following binge alcohol and express a significant increase in hippocampal ectopic localization of newborn neurons. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that a mild brain injury occurring early in life renders the brain highly vulnerable to the consequences of binge-like alcohol consumption."

We also analyzed aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity as a measurement of ethanol metabolism. Adolescent and adult Swiss mice were treated with saline (SAL) or 2.0 g/kg ethanol (EtOH) during 15 days (groups: Adolescent-SAL, Adolescent-EtOH, Adult-SAL and Adult-EtOH). Five days after the last injection, mice were exposed to the three-bottle choice protocol using sucrose fading procedure (4% + sucrose vs. 8%-15% ethanol + sucrose vs. water + sucrose) for 2 hr during the dark phase. Sucrose was faded out from 8% to 0%. The protocol was composed of a 6-week acquisition period, followed by four withdrawals and reexposures. Both adolescent and adult mice exhibited ethanol behavioral sensitization, although the magnitude of sensitization in adolescents was lower than in adults. Adolescent-EtOH displayed an escalation of 4% ethanol consumption during acquisition that was not observed in Adult-EtOH. Moreover, Adult-EtOH consumed less 4% ethanol throughout all the experiment and less 15% ethanol in the last reexposure period than Adolescent-EtOH. ALDH activity varied with age, in which older mice showed higher ALDH than younger ones. Ethanol pretreatment or the pattern of consumption did not have influence on ALDH activity. Our data suggest that ethanol pretreatment during adolescence but not adulthood may influence the pattern of ethanol consumption toward an escalation in ethanol consumption at low dose, without exerting an impact on ALDH activity."

The effects of ethanol exposure during development are both time and dose dependent. Although many animal models of FASD use more chronic ethanol exposure, acute developmental alcohol exposure may also cause long-lasting neuronal changes. Our research employed behavioral measures to assess the effects of a single early postnatal ethanol intoxication event in mice. Mice were dosed at postnatal day 6 (a 2.5 g/kg dose of ethanol or a saline control administered twice, 2 hr apart) as a model of third trimester binge drinking in humans. This exposure was followed by behavioral assessment in male mice at 1 month (1M) and at 4 months of age (4M), using the Barnes maze (for learning/memory retrieval), exploratory behavior, and a social responsiveness task. Ethanol-exposed mice appeared to be less motivated to complete the Barnes maze at 1M, but were able to successfully learn the maze. However, deficits in long-term spatial memory retrieval were observed in ethanol-exposed mice when the Barnes maze recall was measured at 4M. No significant differences were found in open field behavior or social responsiveness at 1M or 4M of age. Acute ethanol exposure at P6 in mice leads to mild but long-lasting deficits in long-term spatial memory.

Here we investigate for the first time whether repeated EtOH exposure (REE) alters the social behavior of zebrafish and influences brain oxidation processes. Animals were exposed to water (control group) or 1% (v/v) EtOH (EtOH group) for 8 consecutive days (20 min per day). EtOH was added directly to the tank water. At day 9, the social behavior and biochemical parameters were assessed. REE increased shoal cohesion by reducing inter-fish and farthest neighbor distances. SOD and CAT activities, as well as NPSH levels decreased in brain tissue. Moreover, REE increased lipid peroxidation suggesting oxidative damage. In summary, changes in oxidation processes may play a role in the CNS effects of EtOH, influencing the social behavior of zebrafish.

In experiment 1, male Wistar rats received 30 min access to \"near-beer\" each day (a malt beverage that looks and tastes like beer but which contains <0.5% ethanol).

Published information relevant to the assessment of the possible genotoxic potential of ethanol has been reviewed and evaluated in terms of the safety of ethanol as an industrial chemical, rather than as a component of beverages. The available data on ethanol from standard genotoxicity test methods are incomplete. There is clear evidence that ethanol is not a bacterial or mammalian cell mutagen but in vitro assays for chromosome aberration, although mostly negative, have generally not included exogenous metabolic activation. Evidence from the use of ethanol as a vehicle control suggests that it is not mutagenic or clastogenic in vitro. Reported tests for chromosome aberration induction in vivo are all negative and only a minority of micronucleus tests are positive. Conflicting results have been reported for the dominant lethal assay, although an inter-laboratory study performed to OECD guidelines was negative. There is some evidence that ethanol induces SCE in vivo and can also act as an aneugen at high doses. Many in vivo studies were designed to model alcoholism and used very high doses, sometimes for long periods. Outcomes may have been affected by disturbances of metabolism giving rise to secondary effects. It is concluded that there is no significant evidence that ethanol is a genotoxic hazard according to the criteria normally applied for the purpose of classification and labeling of industrial chemicals. Some degree of genotoxicity may result from excessive alcohol drinking, but this is not considered relevant to any conceivable exposure obtainable by either inhalation or dermal exposure in the workplace."

In rodents, adolescents have distinct responses to acute ethanol, and prolonged alcohol exposure during adolescence can maintain these phenotypes into adulthood. One brain region that is particularly sensitive to the effects of both acute and chronic ethanol exposure is the hippocampus. Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) produces long lasting changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and dendritic morphology, as well as in the susceptibility to acute ethanol-induced spatial memory impairment. Given the pattern of changes in hippocampal structure and function, one potential target for these effects is the ethanol sensitive GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is known to be involved in synaptic plasticity and dendritic morphology. Thus we sought to determine if there were persistent changes in hippocampal GluN2B signaling cascades following AIE. We employed a previously validated GluN2B-targeted proteomic strategy that was used to identify novel signaling mechanisms altered by chronic ethanol exposure in the adult hippocampus. We collected adult hippocampal tissue (P70) from rats that had been given 2 weeks of AIE from P30-45. Tissue extracts were fractionated into synaptic and non-synaptic pools, immuno-precipitated for GluN2B, and then analyzed using proteomic methods. We detected a large number of proteins associated with GluN2B. AIE produced significant changes in the association of many proteins with GluN2B in both synaptic and non-synaptic fractions. Intriguingly the number of proteins changed in the non-synaptic fraction was double that found in the synaptic fraction. Some of these proteins include those involved in glutamate signaling cytoskeleton rearrangement, calcium signaling, and plasticity. Disruptions in these pathways may contribute to the persistent cellular and behavioral changes found in the adult hippocampus following AIE. Further, the robust change in non-synaptic proteins suggests that AIE may prime this signaling pathway for future ethanol exposures in adulthood."

EtOH withdrawal elicited a selective CA1 pyramidal cell injury in mature slices, but not in immature slices. A significant increase in the expression of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in mature slices revealed that slice maturation is presumably associated with the development of new synapses. Incubation with chronic EtOH for 7 days and its removal from the medium induced a significant decrease in GluA1 and GluA2 expression levels; a significant reduction in the expression of synaptophysin and GluN2A was observed only after EtOH withdrawal. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that incubation with EtOH for 7 days induced a significant decrease in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency in CA1 pyramidal cells of immature slices and a trend toward a decrease in sEPSC amplitude. Electron microscopy revealed a disorganization of neurotubuli in immature slices after chronic exposure to EtOH. These results indicate that prolonged incubation with EtOH and its subsequent withdrawal from the medium induce an impairment of excitatory synaptic transmission and possibly an incorrect formation of neuronal circuits in developing hippocampus in vitro, which is suggestive of mechanisms that may lead to mental retardation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders."

In addition, we found that ethanol induced autophagy and cardiac injury largely via the sequential triggering of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and dissociation of the Beclin 1/Bcl-2 complex. By contrast, inhibition of ethanol-induced autophagic flux with pharmacologic agents in the hearts of mice and cultured cells significantly alleviated ethanol-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart injury. Elimination of ROS with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or inhibition of JNK with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced ethanol-induced autophagy and subsequent autophagy-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, metallothionein (MT), which can scavenge reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, also attenuated ethanol-induced autophagy and cell apoptosis in MT-TG mice.

Ethanol (2 mg/mL) treatment for 1 hr decreased Na+ pump density (x 100,000 molecules ouabain per cell) from a control of 2.80 + or - 0.30 to 1.70 + or - 0.11 (p < 0.001). At 6 and 24 hr (3)H-ouabain binding showed a pattern similar to that seen with the K+ influx, tending to return to pretreatment levels. There was no change in individual pump turnover rates in the presence of ethanol. Following exposure to ethanol, cellular Na+ content steadily increase over the first 6 hr and then returned to control levels. When corrected for parallel changes in cell vol, intracellular Na+ concentration increase by 17% (p < 0.01) after 1 hr and thereafter remained at this higher level throughout the 24 hr period. Measurements of membrane fluidity showed that it was increased markedly by ethanol at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and that the effect bore a close temporal relationship to the changes in active K+ influx and Na+ pump density."

Double immunofluorescence using anti-CYP2E1 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that CYP2E1 was distributed over the cytoplasm and processes, although labeling was more pronounced over the nuclear membrane. Immunogold labeling confirmed this pattern of distribution. Addition of 25 mM ethanol to the astrocyte culture medium for 14 days resulted in an increase in the CYP2E1 content, as determined by confocal microscopy and dot blot. In addition, ethanol induced a dose-dependent increase in the formation of reactive oxygen species that was partially prevented by incubating the astrocytes with anti-CYP2E1. Alcohol also induced a dose-dependent increase in malonaldehyde and hydroxynonenal formation and a depletion of the glutathione (GSH) content. These results suggest that ethanol induces oxidative damage in astrocytes, which could explain some of the toxic effects of ethanol on these cells, such as cytoskeletal alterations. This assumption is supported here by the fact that an increase in GSH content prevents the deleterious effects of alcohol on the cytoskeleton of astrocytes. These results suggest the importance of oxidative stress as a mechanism involved in alcohol-induced neural and brain damage."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ In recent years, it has been hypothesized that muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism may represent a relevant target for the developmental neurotoxicity of ethanol. Age-, brain region-, and receptor-specific inhibitory effects of ethanol on this system have been found, both in vitro and after in vivo administration. As a direct consequence of this action, alterations of calcium homeostasis would be expected, through alterations of inositol trisphosphate formation, which mediates intracellular calcium mobilization. In the present study, the effects of ethanol (50-500 mM) on carbachol-stimulated PI metabolism and free intracellular calcium levels were investigated in rat primary cortical cultures, by measuring release of inositol phosphates and utilizing the two calcium probes fluo-3 and indo-1 on an ACAS (Adherent Cell Analysis and Sorting) Laser Cytometer. Ethanol exerted a concentration-dependent inhibition of carbachol-stimulated PI metabolism. In addition, ethanol's inhibitory effect paralleled the temporal development of the muscarinic receptor signal transduction system, with the strongest inhibition (25-50%) occurring when maximal stimulation by carbachol occurs (days 5-7). Ethanol also exerted a concentration-dependent decrease in free intracellular calcium levels following carbachol stimulation. Both initial calcium spike amplitude, seen in all responsive cells, as well as the total number of cells responding to carbachol, were decreased by ethanol. The inhibitory effects of ethanol seemed dependent upon preincubation time, in that a longer preincubation (30 min) with the lowest dose (50 mM), showed almost the same decrease in responding cell number and reduction in spike amplitude in responding cells, as a shorter incubation (10 min) with the highest ethanol dose (500 mM). The specificity of the response to carbachol was demonstrated by blocking the response with 10 microM atropine. Moreover, experiments with carbachol in calcium-free buffer with 1 mM EGTA indicated that the initial calcium spike was due to intracellular calcium mobilization from intracellular stores. Since calcium is believed to play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, these results support the hypothesis that this intracellular signal-transduction pathway may be a target for ethanol, contributing to its developmental neurotoxicity."

The polyphasic time course of the F-actin content also resembled that under supramaximal CCK-8 stimulation and was counteracted by inhibition of PKC. The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I did not increase the ethanol- induced alpha-amylase secretion, but the suboptimally CCK-8-stimulated secretion via high-affinity receptors.  Ethanol, like supramaximal CCK-8 concentrations, inhibits acinar secretion by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via PKC activation.

Morphometric analyses revealed that exposure to 12.5 mM ethanol for 14 days induced an increase in the number of residual bodies, which are lysosomes containing electron-dense, amorphous materials. Some cells exposed to 50 mM ethanol for 14 days contained an accumulation of glycogen granules, increasing in inverse proportion to the mitochondrial volume. The volumetric proportion of myofibrils on day 14 decreased as the ethanol dose became lower, and was in proportion to large and giant mitochondria within the limits of three ethanol groups. Dose-dependent increases in the size and volumetric proportion of mitochondria were observed after the 14-day exposure; at a low dose (12.5 mM) mitochondria of usual size tended to increase, whereas at a high dose (200 mM) giant mitochondria increased. Coincidentally with this mitochondrial increase or gigantism, all ethanol groups showed higher beat rates than the control. Consequently, it is most likely that chronic 14-day exposures to these three ethanol doses remodel the cellular function of the in vitro myocardium in different ways; the 200-mM dose induced mitochondrial hypertrophy, an adaptive response to switch myocardial energy metabolism over to some special one; the 50-mM dose was a boundary dose; and the 12.5-mM dose mostly mimicked the chronic in vivo administration of ethanol and induced slightly degenerative alterations-increased residual bodies and lysosomes, decreased myofibrils and lowered mitochondrial respiratory function."

ZYC26 reduced the cell death and malondialdehyde levels at a lower dose (1 microM) than 17beta-estradiol (10 microM). The increased carbonyl contents were reduced only by ZYC26 treatment.

However, previous work, using very high exogenous doses of retinol, found that ethanol toxicity led to decreased formation of atRA, apparently due to competitive inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase, which is purportedly involved in the conversion of retinol to retinal. A new study, using assays that are highly sensitive for endogenous atRA, has reported that ethanol toxicity in mice actually increased atRA concentration in certain tissues, including brain hippocampus, apparently due to a mobilization of hepatic retinyl esters that led to increased retinol and atRA in specific tissues."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) system has been suggested to play a key role in ethanol preference and intake, the acute effects of ethanol, and in the development of withdrawal symptoms following ethanol dependence. Ethanol-dependent alterations in glutamatergic signaling within the lateral/basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) are critical for the development and expression of withdrawal-induced anxiety. Notably, the eCB system significantly regulates both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity within the BLA. Chronic ethanol exposure significantly alters eCB system expression within regions critical to the expression of emotionality and anxiety-related behavior, including the BLA. Here, we investigated specific interactions between the BLA eCB system and its functional regulation of synaptic activity during acute and chronic ethanol exposure. In tissue from ethanol naive-rats, a prolonged acute ethanol exposure caused a dose dependent inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic activity via a presynaptic mechanism that was occluded by CB1 antagonist/inverse agonists SR141716a and AM251. Importantly, this acute ethanol inhibition was attenuated following 10 day chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE). CIE exposure also significantly down-regulated CB1-mediated presynaptic inhibition at glutamatergic afferent terminals but spared CB1-inhibition of GABAergic synapses arising from local inhibitory-interneurons. CIE also significantly elevated BLA N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA or anandamide) levels and decreased CB1 receptor protein levels. Collectively, these data suggest a dynamic regulation of the BLA eCB system by acute and chronic ethanol."
