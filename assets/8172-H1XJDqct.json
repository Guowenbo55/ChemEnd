This was preceded by a probe 14-day study. For both studies the dietary concentrations were 0 ppm (control), 10,000, 20,000 or 50,000 ppm TEG, resulting in daily TEG consumptions in the 14-day study of 1132, 2311 or 5916 mg/kg with males, and 1177, 2411 or 6209 mg/kg with females. The corresponding values for the 90-day study were 748, 1522 or 3849 mg/kg (males), and 848, 1699 or 4360 mg/kg (females). In the 14-day study there were no mortalities or clinical signs, and no effects on body weight, hematology, serum chemistry, organ weights, and gross or microscopic pathology. Food consumption was increased at the high dosage. Urinalysis showed increased urine volume and decreased pH with high dose males and females, and increased volume with mid-dose males. In the subchronic study there was neither mortality nor signs of toxicity, and no dosage-related effects with serum chemistry, gross and microscopic pathology. Body weights were reduced during the dosing period with both males and females of the high dosage. Body weight gains were reduced at all dosages with males and females. No hematological effects were seen with females, but males of the mid- and high-dosage groups had slightly reduced erythrocyte count and hematocrit, and high-dose males had decreased hemoglobin concentration with increased mean corpuscular volume. These were considered to reflect a mild hemodilution related to the absorption of large TEG doses. Urinalysis showed dosage-related decreased pH, and increased urine volume mainly at the high dose. These were probably related to the renal excretion of absorbed TEG and/or metabolites. Kidney weight was increased for high-dose females, and increased relative (to body) weight of kidneys for males and females from the mid- and high-dose groups were observed, probably related to the renal excretion of the absorbed TEG and/or its metabolites. These findings indicate that the subchronic continuous po dosing of TEG to rats does not result in local or systemic specific organ or tissue toxicity."

Mortalities occurred at 4824 mg/cu m between exposure days 2 and 5. Nonspecific indications of toxicity at 2011 mg/cu m were signs of irritation, decreased body weight and increased food and water consumption; evidence of hepatic dysfunction was indicated by increased serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities, but liver histology was normal. Fluid imbalance was suggested by increases in water consumption, blood urea nitrogen, relative kidney weight and urine volume, with decreased urine osmolality, pH and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity. At 494 mg/cu m there were minimal signs of irritation, increased water consumption and slightly increased alkaline phosphatase; histology of the kidney was normal. Thus, in this 9 day repeated aerosol whole body exposure study a No-Observed-Effect-Level (NOEL) could not be established. Since preening of the fur at these high aerosol concentrations exposures might have led to a confounding factor from the resultant oral intake, another 9 day repeated aerosol study was conducted, but by nose-only exposure of rats for 6 hr /day to TEG aerosol concentrations of 0, 102, 517 and 1036 mg/cu m. In this study there were no clinical signs, no effects on food and water consumption, and no biochemical or histological evidence of hepatorenal dysfunction. By the end of the exposure period, male and female rats of the 1036 mg/cu m group had body weights lower than those of the controls, but not with statistical significance.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Timed-pregnant CD rats and CD-1 mice were dosed daily by gavage with undiluted triethylene glycol (TEG) over gestational days (gd) 5-15 at 0.0 (water control), 1126, 5630 or 11,260 mg/kg/day with rats and 0.0, 563, 5630 or 11,260 mg/kg/day with mice. They were examined daily, and gestational body weights and food and water consumption measured throughout gestation. At necropsy on gd 21 (rats) or gd 18 (mice) dams were examined for body, gravid uterine, liver and kidney weights, and implantation sites. Maternal kidneys were examined histologically. Fetuses were weighed, sex determined, and examined for external, soft tissue and skeletal variations and malformations. Rat dams had reduced body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption, and increased water consumption and relative kidney weights at 11,260 mg/kg/day. They also had reduced body weight and increased water consumption at 5630 mg/kg/day. Mice had clinical signs and increased relative kidney weight at 11,260 mg/kg/day. Renal histology was normal in both species. Neither species had treatment-related effects on corpora lutea or implantations. Fetal body weights were reduced at 11,260 mg/kg/day (both species) and 5630 mg/kg/day (mice). In rat fetuses there was a pattern of delayed ossification in the thoracic region at 11,260 mg/kg/day. Mouse fetuses had delayed ossification in the frontal and supraoccipital bones, cervical region, hind-limb proximal phalanges and reduced caudal segments at 11,260 mg/kg/day, and in the skull bones at 5630 mg/kg/day. These patterns of delayed ossification are consistent with reduced fetal body weights. No biologically significant embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at any dosage in either species. The NOEL for TEG given by gavage over the period of organogenesis was 1126 mg/kg/day in the rat and 5630 mg/kg/day in the mouse for maternal toxicity, and 5630 mg/kg/day (rat) and 563 mg/kg/day (mouse) for developmental toxicology."
