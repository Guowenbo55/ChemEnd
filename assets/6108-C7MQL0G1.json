After 180 minutes, little oxygen consumption by phenol adapted biological cultures occurred with 4-nitrobenzoic acid(2). The amounts of oxygen consumed after the 180 minute test time are 55 uL (endogenous), 64 uL (cells plus 100 mg/L 3-nitrobenzoic acid), and 346 uL (cells plus phenol - after 90 minutes) which results in a ratio of only 1.2 endogenous to 4-nitrobenzoic acid oxygen consumption(2). In a 2 week Japanese MITI test using 100 mg/L 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 30 mg/L sludge, 4-nitrobenzoic had a theoretical BOD of 62%(3). 4-Nitrobenzene reached 50.2% of its BOD in river water collected from Songhua River, China after 5 days. The river water samples contained about 8.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen, 800-3000/mL bacteria counts, pH 6.8-7.0, and temperatures of 15-20 \u00b0C(4)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: 4-Nitrobenzoic acid was deemed well degraded in the following tests: coupled units test, Zahn-Wellens test, MITI test, Sturm test, OECD Screen test with DOC removal at least 77 % in 28 days or less; but not in a closed bottle test where a theoretical BOD of 48% was obtained(1). In the AFNOR test, 4-nitrobenzoic acid gave 96 and 97 percent removal of DOC in 28 and 42 days, respectively, with no inhibition(2). The UV absorbency of the mononitrobenzoic acid compounds disappeared in 7 days when incubated with sewage effluent in the presence of oxygen, suggesting ring cleavage and possible mineralization(3). The lag time for the degradation of 16 mg/L of 4-nitrobenzoic acid was 3-5 days by wastewater and soil(4). The degradation of 4-nitrobenzoate by domestic sewage was inhibited by benzoate(5). According to the Japanese MITI test, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is considered to be readily biodegradable(6). Three moles of hydrogen are required to reduce the nitro group to an amino group in microbial transformations with the para nitro group being more readily reduced than the ortho group for nitrobenzoic acids(7)."

The probable metabolic pathway for the breakdown of 4-nitrobenzoate in activated sludge is 4-nitrobenzoic acid to p-aminobenzoic acid to p-hydroxybenzoic acid to protocatechuic acid to beta-ketoadipic acid to succinic acid(3). 4-Nitrobenzoic acid biodegraded after a lag of 60-65 hours at a rate of 0.042-0.060 per hour which corresponds to a half-life of 140-170 hours using an electrolytic respirometer(4)."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-nitrobenzoic acid is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of 4-nitrobenzoic acid is 3.44(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
