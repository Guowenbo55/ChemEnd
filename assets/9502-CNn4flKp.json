It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a dichlorobenzene and a member of phenylureas. It is functionally related to a N-methyl urea.",

            "Value": "Linuron residues accumulated in bluegill fish during 28 days of exposure to water treated at 0.1 and 1.0 ppm [C14] linuron(1). Maximum bioconcentration factors were 49 for whole fish, 34 for a muscle and 39 for carcass tissues. After 28 days of exposure, linuron residues in the viscera were identified as desmethyl linuron, norlinuron, and glucuronide conjugates. The edible tissues were not analyzed for linuron residues. Residues rapidly declined to approximately 10% of maximum levels after the 14-day depuration period(1). In one bioaccumulation study, orange-red killifish were exposed to 0.02 to 0.2 mg/l of linuron for 28 days(2). At the end of the experiment, the BCF of linuron in the fish ranged from 13 to 23. According to a classification scheme(3), BCF values ranging from 13 to 49 suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from low to moderate."

            "Value": "Most evidence indicates that linuron's loss in soil is due to biodegradation(1-2). Biodegradation is mainly cometabolic(1-2). Evidence for linuron's biodegradation in soil is found in the fact that degradation proceeds far slower in soil sterilized by heat or with chemicals(1). Loss of linuron also correlates with soil respiration(3). The degradation rate also is correlated with soil organic carbon content, adsorptivity and clay content(1,3). The rate of biodegradation increases as the concn of linuron in the soil decreases(4). The rate constant for the decomposition in soil increases as the square root of the concn at high concns and linear with the concn at low concns(2). At higher soil moistures and temperatures, linuron degrades faster(1,5). In most soils, at normal application rates, linuron degrades within 3-4 months(1). The half-lives of 4 ppm linuron incubated at 25 \u00b0C in 18 mineral soils ranged from 22 to 86 days(5). The degradation rate of linuron in a sandy loam soil at 20 \u00b0C was 0.0080 per day (half-life 87 days)(3)."

            "Value": "Laboratory experiments which assessed the affect of soil moisture and temperature on linuron degradation found that the half-life at 12% soil moisture increased from approximately 30 days at 30 \u00b0C to 90 days at 5 \u00b0C(1). At 25 \u00b0C, the half-life increased from 34 days to 45 days as the soil moisture decreased from 18% to 4%. Linuron degradation proceeded by the loss of the carbonyl group(1). The half-lives in two soils were linearly related to soil moisture content(1). In laboratory experiments on Colorado and Oregon soils, the half-lives at 25 \u00b0C were 38 and 52 days, respectively, at 16.8% moisture content and 638 and 154 days, respectively, at 2.5% mositure content(2). The 638 day half-life in Colorado soil is out of line with other data - at 5.1% moisture, the half-lives were respectively 109 and 136 days for Colorado and Oregon soils(2). The half-life of linuron in Colorado loam at 25 \u00b0C was 29 days under wet conditions (soil moisture at field capacity) and 98 days under dry conditions (soil moisture at 25% field capacity)(3).

In contrast to other studies, a study performed on four Hungarian soils, both sterilized and untreated, in which the soil was incubated for 10 weeks at different temperatures, concluded that degradation proceeds primarily by abiotic means(2). Chemical decomposition predominated at 10 \u00b0C with the proportion of chemical to microbial degradation decreasing with increasing temperature and then increasing at 37 \u00b0C. Mixed populations of microorganisms in river water or sewage did not biodegrade linuron during a period of 4 months(3). A possible explanation for linuron's biodegradation in soil and lack of biodegradation in solution may be a surface catalyzation as has been offered for a similar pesticide, diuron(4). Linuron, present at 100mg/l, reached 0% of it theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(5). Linuron is taken up by the roots and extensively metabolized in plants(6)."

The upper section of the soil contained 500 mg/kg(3). In a field study, some linuron did leach into the 2-4 cm soil layer of soil; results were not conclusive due to variability of residues in core samples(4). Many studies have shown that after spraying linuron, residues are most commonly found in the top 5 cm, and generally not deeper than 10 cm(5). The mean adsorption of linuron to 10 New Jersey soils taken from the A horizon was 1,498 and 2,964 ug/100 g of soil loadings of 500 ug/100 ml and 1,000 ug/100 ml, respectively(6).

            "content": "The absorption and translocation of atrazine and linuron were studied in carrot, parsnip, lettuce, and turnip seedlings. Significant differences were observed among species in herbicide distribution within the plants. Carrot and parsnip seedlings retained a high proportion of absorbed linuron in their root systems, while lettuce and turnip translocated over 60% of absorbed linuron to the shoot. With atrazine, differences among species were less pronounced. The amount of herbicide translocated correlated with the amount of water transpired by the plants, but the effective concentrations in the transpiration stream were lower than in the treatment solutions. Thin-layer chromatography of plant extracts revealed that up to 45% of translocated linuron in parsnip and carrot was metabolized, while little metabolism occurred in the shoots of lettuce and turnip or in the roots of any species. These findings suggest that parsnip and carrot seedlings' tolerance to linuron is due to a combination of root fixation and metabolism in the shoot.",
