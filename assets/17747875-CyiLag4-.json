            "content": "The herbicide aminocyclopyrachlor demonstrates systemic properties, exhibiting varying degrees of absorption and translocation among different plant species. The study investigated its uptake and movement in prickly lettuce, yellow starthistle, and rush skeletonweed. The absorption varied across species and formulations (DPX-MAT28 and DPX-KJM44), with rush skeletonweed displaying the highest absorption rates for both forms. Yellow starthistle absorbed more DPX-KJM44 than DPX-MAT28, while prickly lettuce showed lower absorption overall. Translocation from treated leaves to the rest of the plant was notably higher in yellow starthistle compared to the other species, particularly for DPX-KJM44. Rush skeletonweed exhibited early translocation to root tissue and relatively slower de-esterification of DPX-KJM44 into DPX-MAT28. The differences in absorption and translocation patterns were influenced by the active ingredient's structure, species sensitivity, and the process of de-esterification. The study highlights that while DPX-KJM44 enhances absorption, its delayed de-esterification affects early translocation in certain species like rush skeletonweed, emphasizing the importance of understanding sensitivity and de-esterification rates for effective weed control strategies using aminocyclopyrachlor.",
