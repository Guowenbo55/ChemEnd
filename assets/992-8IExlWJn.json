Intermediate products of 3,5-dichlorophenol, 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol were reported(1). Increasing the concn of pentachlorophenol, from 1 to 10 mg/L, increased the time required for complete biodegradation. Complete biodegradation at pH 7 and 8 required 13 and 3 days, respectively; only 20% biodegradation was reported by day 19 for cultures incubated at pH 6(1). Anaerobic biodegradation of a pentachlorophenol-contaminated soil resulted in an initial increase in pentachlorophenol concns due to desorption; this was followed by a period of dechlorination giving 2,3,4,5- and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol as initial metabolites(2). No biodegradation occurred in anaerobic clay loam soil with no added nutrients(3). Other studies in soil have suggested greater biodegradation under anaerobic conditions producing pentachloroanisole and tri- and tetrachlorophenols(4,5). The order of pentachlorophenol dechlorination in anaerobic sediment is ortho to produce 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol, ortho to produce 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, meta to produce 2,4-dichlorophenol, and para or ortho to produce 2-chlorophenol or 4-chlorophenol(6)."

            "Value": "As with other chlorophenols, the biochemical action of pentachlorophenol is active uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The molecular basis for this is not clear. PCP binds to mitochondrial protein and inhibits mitochondrial ATP-ase activity. Thus, both the formation of ATP and the release of energy to the cell from the breakdown of ATP to ADP are prevented. Electron transport is not inhibited by PCP, although reactions dependent on available high-energy bonds, such as oxidative and glycolytic phosphorylation, are affected. Binding to enzymic protein has been reported and may lead to the inhibition of other cellular enzymes. There is an increase in cellular oxygen demand during the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. This causes the initial rise in respiration rate reported in individuals poisoned by PCP. PCP is toxic to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. The toxicity of PCP is increased by impurities in some formulations. In some instances, it is very difficult to know whether the impurities have affected the poisoning. Dermatitis and chloracne are caused by contaminants such as PCDDs and PCDFs."

Deaminase assay performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to chlorophenolic compounds and its derivatives demonstrated a decreased proliferation rate and cell death. Chlorophenolic exposure also led to impaired production of IL-21 and IL-9 along with many other cytokines and chemokines that potentiate the inflammatory response. Using the PBMC activation model and gene expression profiling provide insights into mechanisms by which the chlorophenolic compounds and their derivatives, especially pentachlorophenol (PCP) dysregulate the inflammatory response.

Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted. /Chlorophenols/"

At 6.5 mg/kg/day, one male and one female dog were sacrificed in extremis on days 247 and 305, respectively, due to significant clinical toxicity (significant weight loss, lethargy, marked dehydration, vomiting, icterus). Group mean body weight in surviving male dogs at the 6.5 mg/kg/day dose was decreased by 15% at week 13, and 21% at study termination. In females, a 19% decrease in group mean body weight was observed at week 13, and bodyweight remained significantly decreased until study termination. Decreased red cell count (16%), hemoglobin (9%), and hematocrit (8%), was observed in males at the 6.5 mg/kg/day dose at week 13. These decreases were also observed at week 26 and at necropsy. In females, significant decreases of 10-17% in these hematologic parameters were observed at 6.5 mg/kg/day from week 26 until study termination. Activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were significantly elevated for both sexes throughout the study at the 6.5 mg/kg/day dose. Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity was increased in male dogs at week 13 by 45%. Absolute and relative liver weight in males and females was elevated by 32% and 49% over control at 6.5 mg/kg/day. Absolute and relative thyroid weight was also increased significantly in females at the 6.5 mg/kg/day dose. Gross stomach lesions consisting of multiple, raised mucosal foci were observed in increased incidence in all treated groups of male and female dogs with only one female control dog showing a similar lesion. Dark, discolored liver was also observed in increased incidence in male and female treated dogs, but a dose-response was observed only for males. Microscopically, increased incidence of lymphocytic mucosal inflammation was observed in the stomach of treated males and females. The lesion was presenting in all treated and control groups, but the severity of the lesion was increased, especially at the 3.5 and 6.5 mg/kg/day doses.

Mean body weights of mice exposed to technical-grade pentachlorophenol and EC-7 were comparable to those of controls until weeks 36-82. Thereafter, a 4%-22% dose-related decrease was observed in the mid and high dose mice exposed to EC-7 and in high dose mice exposed to technical-grade pentachlorophenol. Females were more affected than males. Feed consumption by exposed mice was similar to that by controls. The average daily doses of technical-grade pentachlorophenol were approximately 17-18 or 35 mg/kg compared with 17-18, 34-37, or 114-118 mg/kg of EC-7. Survival of mice did not appear to be affected by exposure to either technical-grade pentachlorophenol or EC-7 at the doses used in these studies. The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were increased (dose related) in male and female mice exposed to either technical-grade pentachlorophenol or EC-7, although the increase was less marked in females exposed to technical-grade pentachlorophenol (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: technical-grade: male-- control, 7/32, 22%; low dose, 26/47, 55%; high dose, 37/48, 77%; female--3/33, 9%; 9/49, 18%; 9/50, 18%; EC-7: male--control, 6/35, 17%; low dose, 19/48, 40%; mid dose, 21/48, 44%; high dose, 34/49, 69%; female-- 1/34, 3%; 4/50, 8%; 6/49, 12%; 31/48, 65%).

For purified pentachlorophenol, the number of rats per group was as follows: control, 33 rats; 5 mg/kg, 15 rats; 15 mg/kg, 18 rats; 30 mg/kg/, 20 rats; 50 mg/kg, 19 rats. For the commercial grade of pentachlorophenol: 5 mg/kg, 18 rats; 15 mg/kg, 17 rats; 30 mg/kg, 19 rats; 50 mg/kg, 15 rats. Additional groups of rats were administered 0 or 30 mg/kg/day pentachlorophenol (type of a.i. not specified) on days 8-11 or 12-15 of gestation. Maternal toxicity from purified pentachlorophenol was evidenced by decreased maternal weight gain at the 30 and 50 mg/kg dose groups for days 6-21 of gestation (74% decrease vs. control). For the commercial grade, weight gain was decreased 43% at the 50 mg/kg dose, and by 22% at the 30 mg/kg dose. Weight gain appeared more significantly affected by purified pentachlorophenol. No other significant signs of maternal toxicity were observed. Fetal incidence of resorption was significantly increased at 30 and 50 mg/kg purified and commercial grade pentachlorophenol. The report stated that the fetal and litter incidence was also significantly increased at 15 mg/kg commercial grade pentachlorophenol, but the fetal incidence (7 and 8% at control and 15 mg/kg/day) as well as the litter incidence (55 and 64% at control and 15 mg/kg/day) did not appear biologically meaningful. Fetal body weight was reported significantly decreased for commercial grade pentachlorophenol at 30 and 50 mg/kg/day and at 30 mg/kg/day for purified pentachlorophenol, but actual values were not reported. Crown-rump length was significantly decreased at 30 mg/kg/day purified pentachlorophenol. The litter incidence of subcutaneous edema, lumber spurs, and supernumerary, lumber or fused ribs was significantly increased at 30 and 50 mg/kg commercial grade pentachlorophenol, but the data did not indicate a dose-response, i.e. the number of litters affected with subcutaneous edema, rib and vertebral abnormalities were greater at 30 mg/kg than at 50 mg/kg for the commercial grade of pentachlorophenol and for the purified pentachlorophenol. The number of litters at the high dose of purified pentachlorophenol was also severely limited (only 2 litters at this dose). Resorptions were significantly increased when pentachlorophenol (both grades) was administered on gestation days 8-11, but not on gestation days 12-15. Based on the results of this study, the Maternal NOAEL can be considered as 15 mg/kg/day, based on body weight effects, for both grades of pentachlorophenol. The Developmental NOAEL would appear to differ according to grade of pentachlorophenol used. Limited data for purified pentachlorophenol at the 50 mg/kg/dose hampers evaluation of a NOAEL and LOAEL for this grade. For the commercial grade of pentachlorophenol, the NOAEL can be considered as 15 mg/kg/day, and the LOAEL as 30 mg/kg/day, based on decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length. The responses observed at the low dose of commercial grade pentachlorophenol for fetal anomalies (i.e. lumber spurs, anomalous ribs, subcutaneous edema) do not show a dose-response pattern at the higher doses of pentachlorophenol, and are also limited by reduced number of litters at the high dose."

Gestational and lactational body weights of P1 and F1 female rats were also significantly decreased. Fertility index and number of litters were decreased in both generations at 60 mg/kg/day pentachlorophenol. Days to vaginal patency were significantly increased in P1 female pups, as was days to preputial separation in P1 male pups. Estrous cycling was not significantly affected in either P1 or F1 females, but in F1 males, the number of sperm observed with a broken flagellum was significantly increased at 60 mg/kg/day, and the average testicular spermatid count was significantly decreased at 60 mg/kg/day. Testis weight in F1 generation males was also decreased. Decreased brain weight (4-8%) and increased liver weight (20-33%) were observed in both P1 and F1 male and female rats at 60 mg/kg/day. Macroscopic pathology (enlarged liver) and microscopic pathology (centrilobular hypertrophy, subacute inflammation, single cell necrosis, pigment deposition) were observed in increased incidence at 60 mg/kg/day. The single cell necrosis and pigment deposition were considered related to treatment. Mean litter size, number of live pups, and viability index were significantly reduced in the P1 and F1 pups. Decreased weight of the liver, brain, spleen, and thymus were observed in F2 pups at 60 mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, body weight and weight gain decreases of approximately 11% were observed in F1 female parental rats. Significant decreases in average testicular spermatid count and testis weight were observed in F1 male parental rats. Based on the data in this study, the Systemic NOAEL = 10 mg/kg/day for male and female parental rats. The Systemic LOAEL = 30 mg/kg/day for male and female rats, based on decreased body weight and weight gain in F1 generation parental rats, and adverse testicular effects in F1 male rats (decreased testis weight, decreased spermatid count). The reproductive NOAEL = 10 mg/kg/day in this study. The reproductive LOAEL = 30 mg/kg/day, based on decreased group mean litter weight."

The extent of axonal conduction block was determined by measuring the compound action potentials evoked by supramaximal stimulation. Desheathed sciatic nerve preparations were incubated with 0.3 to 3 mM pentachlorophenol for 20 min, following which the preparations were placed in fresh medium. Compound action potentials were measured for up to 60 min to assess the reversibility of the block. Sheathed or desheathed nerve preparations were incubated with 3 mM pentachlorophenol at pHs 7.0 and 9.0 to assess the effect of pH on the axonal block. Phenol, pentachlorophenol, and procaine induced axonal conduction block in a dose dependent manner. The doses for causing a 50% block were phenol 6.30 mM, pentachlorophenol 1.00 mM, and procaine 2.00 mM. The block was irreversible. Shifting the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 9.0 in the absence of pentachlorophenol caused a nonsignificant axonal conduction block. When pentachlorophenol was present the same pH change caused a significant decrease in the axonal block. The eighth ganglia from the paravertebral chain of C-caudiverbera spinal cords were incubated with 0.003 to 0.03 mM pentachlorophenol at pH 7.0 and 9.0. In some experiments 0.1 mM 3,4-diaminopyridine was present. The effects on synaptic transmission were assessed by measuring compound action potentials as before. Pentachlorophenol induced a synaptic transmission block that was dose dependent and irreversible. The pentachlorophenol induced block at pH 9.0 was significantly less than at pH 7.0. 3,4-Diaminopyridine antagonized the effect of pentachlorophenol."

When the chlorine was present in both ortho positions to the hydroxyl group, the competitor was more efficient. The relative affinity of binding of PCP to TTR was twice that of T4. PCP mainly decreased the affinity constant while the binding capacity was not altered. This indicated a competitive type of inhibition. PCP competed successfully with T4 sites on albumin as well with a relative affinity of 0.25.

The concentrations reducing the respiratory control ratio of the control to 50% ranged from 599 uM with 2 chlorophenol to 0.110 uM with pentachlorophenol. The RCR50 concentrations for the five chlorophenols were compared to six physicochemical parameters for the same chlorophenols; high degrees of correlation between the the concentrations reducing the respiratory control ratio of the control to 50% and the physicochemical parameters were found (r : 0.890). The highest correlation coefficient obtained was with the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (r = 0.991), indicating that the ability of chlorophenols to partition into the lipid mitochondrial membrane plays a significant role in eliciting its toxic effects. The concentrations reducing the respiratory control ratio of the control to 50% were also compared to nine currently existing short-term toxicity tests. High degrees of correlation were obtained with several of the tests, including algal, bacterial, and fish bioassays. This suggests that the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the major mechanism by which chlorophenols cause toxicity to intact cells as well as more complex organisms. The use of mitochondrial respiratory parameters appears to offer a complementary approach as a short term toxicity test for this class of compounds. Further development and testing with a variety of other toxicants is suggested."

Since lag times were observed for the expression of cytotoxicity by the pesticides, biotransformation appeared important for the toxicity. Currently the concentration of pesticides is very low in the environment, and therefore the possibility of causing an impact on human health is low.

Cells exposed to increasing concentrations of PCP show increasing inhibition to RNA and ribosome synthesis, and to cell growth. TCH causes a delay of the growth of the cell culture (prolongation of the lag phase) but does not cause inhibition. After treatment with TCH the maximum of the RNA synthesis was retarded, but subsequently reached nearly the same level as the untreated control cells. On ribosome synthesis and ribosome content, treatment with increasing concentrations of PCP, as well as of TCH, leads to a substantial decrease in ribosomal synthesis and, finally, total inhibition. Parallel to this, the content of free and membrane-bound ribosomes is diminished. PCP exhibits a stronger effect than TCH. The protein synthesis is only slightly reduced after treatment with PCP or TCH (with concentrations up to 20 ug/mL)."

Pentachlorophenol has been reported to be highly embryolethal and embryotoxic in rats. However, data pertaining to the developmental toxicities of other important chlorophenols are limited. In this study, the toxicities of phenol, chlorophenol homologues and their isomers, selected phenyl acetates, anisoles, sodium phenates, and tetrachlorobenzoquinones (a total of 38 chemicals) were evaluated using cultures of Hydra attenuata. Developmental hazard index (A/D ratio) was determined for selected test chemicals (ie, those chemicals which resulted in an early toxic endpoint at the lowest whole-log concn in the adult hydra assay). These same chemicals were evaluated at equimolar concentration in postimplantation rat whole embryo culture. Hydra attenuata and whole embryo culture studies demonstrated a linear relationship between toxicity and the degree of chlorine substitution with pentachlorophenol > 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol > 2,3,5-trichlorophenol > 3,5-dichlorophenol > 4-chlorophenol > phenol. The developmental hazard index A/D ratios from the Hydra attenuata assay were approximately 1 for all of the chemicals tested. Findings from the whole embryo culture assay indicated similar results based on growth, gross morphology, and DNA and protein content of embryos."

To assess the direct effects of technical grade pentachlorophenol on B cells, the splenic plaque-forming cell response and serum antibody titers to the T-independent antigen, dinitrophenyl Ficoll, were examined. Technical grade pentachlorophenol exposure altered the kinetics and the magnitude of the humoral antibody responses to sheep red blood cells and dinitrophenyl Ficoll. Peak splenic antibody production and serum antibody responses were dose-dependently suppressed by technical grade pentachlorophenol exposure. IgM responses appeared to be more sensitive to technical grade pentachlorophenol induced suppression than the IgG response. Significant depresssion of the IgM anti-sheep red blood cells splenic hemolytic antibody isotope release response was apparent as early as 2 wk after initiation of technical grade pentachlorophenol exposure and persisted for at least 8 wk after terminination of technical grade pentachlorophenol feeding. Liver wt and serum lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly elevated during technical grade pentachlorophenol exposure and returned to control levels after a 4-6 wk recovery period.

Twelve adult nonlaboratory Holstein cattle were administered 0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mg/kg purified pentachlorophenol for 95 days.

All plant parts and soil samples were extracted and separated into nonpolar and polar fractions. Major nonpolar and polar metabolites were identified by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Nonpolar fractions from both soybean and spinach plants were found to contain pentachlorophenol and its metabolites, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, methoxytetrachlorophenol, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole, and pentachloroanisole. Cleavage of polar metabolites from the soybean plants by acid hydrolysis yielded organic solvent-extractable products. These products were identified as pentachlorophenol, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, and methoxytetrachlorophenol. Cleavage of polar materials from spinach plants yielded only pentachlorophenol. The polar metabolites from the soybean plants were also subjected to enzymatic cleavage by \u03b2-glucosidase. The conjugates consisted mostly of O-glucosides of the same metabolites released by acid hydrolysis. Failure of hydrolysis by aryl sulfatase indicated that very little or no sulfates were present. The metabolites found in the plants were not detected in soil samples obtained from pots immediately after the plants were harvested.",
