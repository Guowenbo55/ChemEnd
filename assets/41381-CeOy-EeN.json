In field enclosures, cucumbers treated with 1.68 or 3.36 kg ai/ha preemergence soil-surface applications of 14C-ethalfluralin accumulated significantly more 14C in leaves than in petioles, stems, or fruits. In greenhouse studies, 14C-ethalfluralin vapor was absorbed by both cucumber seedling stems and cotyledons. Seedlings absorbed 14C-ethalfluralin from a nutrient solution and translocated 14C into all plant parts. Cucumber absorbed 14C-ethalfluralin topically applied to the stem and translocated 14C acropetally, while only limited basipetal translocation occurred. Although cotyledons absorbed 14C-ethalfluralin, very little 14 C moved out of the treated tissue.",

Two treatments resulted in ethalfluralin being applied at rates of 1.68 and 3.36 kg/ha, respectively. The culverts were irrigated with approximately 1.0 cm of water after application.",

Four replications of one plant for each treatment were used for the vapor uptake study, and three replications of two plants for each treatment were used for the root uptake study."
