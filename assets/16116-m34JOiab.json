            "Value": "The Koc of siduron is predicted in one study to be 420(1). Using a log Kow of 3.80(2) and a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(3), the Koc is estimated as 330(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that siduron is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. A Pesticide Leaching Potential (PLP) Index of 53 for foliar application and 57 for soil application was calculated for siduron using commonly reported Koc, persistence (half-life), and rate of application values(5,6). PLP values of 0 and 100 indicate no leaching potential and maximum leaching potential, respectively(6). Siduron was classified as having low mobility using retention factors from soil TLC using Hagerstown silty clay loam soil plates(7)."

The amount adsorbed on Keyport silt loam in equilibrium with 1 ppm in soil solution at 22.5 \u00b0C is 2.5 ppm (average Koc is 420 mL/g). Siduron is moderately resistant to leaching. Movement is least in soils high in clay or organic matter and greatest in sand."

The maximum absorption observed was 0.13 \u00b5M, representing 3% of the added 14C. While siduron absorbed by barley leaves did not move into the roots, approximately 50% of the siduron-14C absorbed by roots was translocated to the shoots. The soluble 14C was more prevalent in the shoots than in the roots, with 7% of the absorbed 14C in roots and 6% in shoots being incorporated into the insoluble residue. Importantly, the absorbed siduron did not seem to undergo metabolism into other compounds, suggesting possible intact incorporation. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that only siduron was present in the labeled compound within both root and shoot soluble fractions, indicating its persistence without transformation into other substances.",
