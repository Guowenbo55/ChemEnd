Acetone cyanohydrin, present at 100 mg/L, reached 53-64% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(2). Acetone cyanohydrin dissociates in water (an equilibrium reaction), with half-life of 9 minutes at neutral pH, to form acetone and hydrogen cyanide(3); using the same Japanese MITI test, acetone has theoretical BOD of 98%(2) which might suggest the presence of hydrogen cyanide decreases the biodegradation rate with respect to acetone cyanohydrin in this test(SRC)."

Cyanide release is believed to be a possible mechanism of toxicological action. Under experimental conditions, cyanide antagonists altered the acute toxicity of aliphatic nitriles. Electron transport is thought to be interrupted through inhibition of cytochrome-oxidase by cyanide, thus compromising oxidative metabolism and phosphorylation. Enzymatic studies indicated that metabolic conversion was required prior to activation, and that free cyanide was detected after aliphatic nitrile overexposure in animals."

Irritation of the eyes and/or nose and breathing difficulties in the mid (29.9 ppm) and high (59.6 ppm) exposure group were observed during exposure. Signs associated with anoxia/hypoxia, such as respiratory distress, tremors and/or convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and prostrate were observed following the first exposure in four high exposure (59.6 ppm) males. Three of these animals subsequently died. Chromorhinorrhea and signs of irritation about the eyes were also observed at pre- and post exposure periods.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ Konzo is a neurotoxic motor disease caused by excess consumption of insufficiently processed cassava. Cassava contains the cyanogenic glucoside linamarin, but konzo does not present the known pathological effects of cyanide. We hypothesized that the aglycone of linamarin, acetone cyanohydrin, may be the cause of konzo. This nitrile rapidly decomposes into cyanide and acetone, but the particular exposure and nutrition conditions involved in the emergence of konzo may favor its stabilization and subsequent acute neurotoxicity. A number of preliminary observations were used to design an experiment to test this hypothesis. In the experiment, young female Long-Evans rats were given 10mM acetone cyanohydrin in drinking water for 2 weeks, and then 20 mM for 6 weeks. Nutrition deficits associated with konzo were modeled by providing tapioca (cassava starch) as food for the last 3 of these weeks. After this period, rats were fasted for 24 hr in order to increase endogenous acetone synthesis, and then exposed to 0 (control group) or 50 umol/kg-hr of acetone cyanohydrin for 24 hr (treated group) through subcutaneous osmotic minipump infusion (n=6/group). Motor activity and gait were evaluated before exposure (pre-test), and 1 and 6 days after exposure. Brains (n=4) were stained for neuronal degeneration by fluoro-jade B. Rats exposed to 50 umol/kg-hr of acetone cyanohydrin showed acute signs of toxicity, but no persistent motor deficits. Two animals showed fluoro-jade staining in discrete thalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular and the ventral reuniens nuclei; one also exhibited labeling of the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. Similar effects were not elicited by equimolar KCN exposure. Therefore, acetone cyanohydrin may cause selective neuronal degeneration in the rat, but the affected areas are not those expected in an animal model of konzo."

The results demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against the cells of Ehrlich ascites tumor. The concentrations of 20 and 30 ug x mL(-1) was 100% of cell death in only 1 and 2 hours respectively. In lower doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ug x mL(-1) the cytotoxic effect was less intense, increasing gradually with time. At low concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ug x mL(-1), more than 90% of cell death was observed only after 24 hours of incubation which is the evidence that the tumor cell has the ability to poison cumulatively and irreversibly itself with the acetone cyanohydrin when compared with the results presented by human lymphocytes that the same doses and at the same time of incubation reached a maximum of 30% of cell death, suggesting an activity of rhodanese differentiated between the two cells."
