    "Description": "Metsulfuron methyl is a N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfonyl group is attached to a 2-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl group while a (4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group replaces one of the amino hydrogens of the remaining urea group. It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a benzoate ester, a N-sulfonylurea and a methoxy-1,3,5-triazine.",

            "content": "The locoweeds, woolly loco and silky crazyweed, contribute to livestock poisoning in the western United States. Differences in response of these two locoweeds to foliar-applied picloram and metsulfuron was investigated by evaluating differences in herbicide uptake, translocation, and metabolism. Silky crazyweed compared to woolly loco was more than 10 times as sensitive to increasing rates of either herbicide. The two species absorbed 8 to 15%, and 11 to 17% of applied picloram and metsulfuron, respectively. Translocation of picloram and metsulfuron out of treated leaflets of either species was less than 3% of that absorbed after 96 h. Approximately 70 and 100% of the absorbed herbicides remained as picloram and metsulfuron, respectively, in both species. Therefore, differences in picloram or metsulfuron uptake, translocation, and metabolism appear inadequate to account for the differential response to each herbicide by the two locoweed species. Selectivity differences between these locoweed genera to picloram and metsulfuron most likely are due to sensitivity differences at sites of action.",

            "content": "Old World climbing fern is one of the most invasive plants in natural areas of central and southern Florida. The fern spreads across the landscape by wind-blown spores and invades isolated and undisturbed habitats such as interior portions of the Florida Everglades. Land managers in Florida have reported that multiple herbicide treatments are required to control the fern, which could indicate that herbicides do not translocate throughout the plant in long-established populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the absorption and translocation patterns in Old World climbing fern using the three herbicides most commonly used for management of this plant by land managers in Florida. Using 14C-labeled herbicides, we evaluated absorption and translocation of glyphosate (2.25 kg ai ha\u22121), metsulfuron (0.10 kg ai ha\u22121), and triclopyr (1.68 kg ai ha\u22121) in Old World climbing fern using five different application scenarios (cut-and-spray, basal spray, 25% foliar spray, 50% foliar spray, and 100% foliar spray). Triclopyr was absorbed to the greatest extent (60.3%) of applied radioactive compounds compared to glyphosate (31.2%) and metsulfuron (19.8%). The majority of radioactivity remained in treated leaves for all herbicides with only small percentages of the absorbed radioactivity being detected in other plant parts. All three herbicides translocated acropetally and basipitally to some extent. Radioactivity, for the most part, translocated evenly throughout the plants but the greatest amount of radioactivity derived from triclopyr occurred in rhizomes when the cut-and-spray and basal applications were used. The radioactivity in rhizomes derived from glyphosate was greater in those treated using cut-and-spray. Based on autoradiographs, there was limited horizontal movement of any herbicide in the rhizomes of Old World climbing fern which could explain why resprouts are observed several weeks following treatment.",
