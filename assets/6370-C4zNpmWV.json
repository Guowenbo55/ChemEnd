According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The BCF of dichlorofluoromethane is reported as low using carp (Cyprinus carpio) which were exposed over an 8-week period (actual BCF value not reported)(4)."

In soil samples collected from a forest, complete degradation of dichlorofluoromethane, initially present at approximately 26 ppm, by methanotrophic bacteria occurred within approximately 5 days when methane was added to the soil(1). In batch experiments using soil pre-exposed to landfill gas incubated with methane and air, dichlorofluoromethane degraded with an oxidation rate 0.509 ug/g soil-hour(2). Dichlorofluoromethane, present at 11.6 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at a reported concentration of sludge of 1 drop/L in the Japanese MITI test(3)."

Approximately 90% of dichlorofluoromethane was degraded in 24 hours (degradation rate of 0.3 umol/hour) by a mixed methanotrophic culture (ENV2041) suspended in a 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid solution at 20 degrees C with a pH of 7.4; degradation rates of 0.2 and 0.1 were observed using M. trichosporium (OB3b) and M. vaccae (JOB5), respectively(2). The degradation half-life of dichlorofluoromethane in an anaerobic sewage sludge microcosm experiment was 30 days with chlorofluoromethane identified as a degradation product(3). The degradation half-life of dichlorofluoromethane in an anaerobic aquifer sediment microcosm experiment was 63.7 days with chlorofluoromethane identified as a degradation product(3)."

Histopathologic examination showed centrilobular necrosis with related changes.

Four dogs exposed at both levels showed weight loss. Cirrhosis was evident in rats exposed at both levels, but with dogs histopathologic changes in the liver were mild and evident only at the 5000 ppm."

It may be concluded from this study that FC 11, FC 12 and FC 114 exhibit a vasodepressor activity on skeletal muscle vascular bed which is readily overcome by the hypotension-induced activation of the sympathetic system but which becomes evident when reflex activity is prevented by vagotomy. ..."
