            "content": "Flucetosulfuron is a sulfonylurea herbicide effective against barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in paddy rice (Oryza sativa). This study aimed to understand the physiological basis of selectivity between barnyardgrass and rice regarding the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of foliar-applied flucetosulfuron. Results showed that barnyardgrass initially absorbed over 70% of [14C]flucetosulfuron at 6 hours after treatment (HAT), while rice absorbed only about 20% of the applied radioactivity. Over time, barnyardgrass absorbed 3.6, 2.8, 1.7, and 1.6 times more than rice at 12, 24, 48, and 72 HAT, respectively. This greater absorption led to about 3 times more translocation out of the treated leaf in barnyardgrass compared to rice.",

                "Plant Grown Condition": "Seeds were germinated in flats with commercial greenhouse soil mix and watered with tap water. Plants were grown in a greenhouse maintained at 25\u00b13/15\u00b13\u00b0C day/night with a 14-hour photoperiod for 6 days until the 3 to 3.5 leaf stage at application time.",

                "Pesticide Application Details for the Plant": "10 \u03bcl of the radiolabelled solution was applied in 10 droplets to the adaxial leaf surface of the middle of third fully expanded leaf of rice and barnyardgrass.",
                "Other Information": "Plants were harvested at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours after treatment (HAT). At harvest, the treated 3rd leaf was washed sequentially three times with acetonitrile:water (20:80 v/v) to remove unabsorbed 14C. Plants were separated into treated leaf, first/second leaves, fourth leaf, and roots. Oxidative combustion followed by liquid scintillation counting was used to quantify 14C in each plant part. The study did not mention replicates."
