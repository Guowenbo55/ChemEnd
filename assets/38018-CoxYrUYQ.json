            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: Between 1989 and 1991, 181 sediment samples from Woods Pond, Lenox MA were collected and studied to determine the extent of PCB biodegradation in situ(1). Sediment samples had been contaminated with a mixture of both Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 with a ratio of approximately 95:5. Contamination of the sediment samples was a result of two transformer manufacturing plants located upstream from Woods Pond. All 181 samples collected from Woods Pond showed evidence of dechlorination, but even those showing the most extensive dechlorination had lost only 13.7% of the meta and para chlorines. In Woods Pond, meta-dechlorination was favored over para-dechlorination, and only meta and para chlorines located adjacent to other chlorines were removed by dechlorination(1). Although the dechlorination was modest, it substantially reduced the concns of the congeners that are reported to be most persistent in humans. The most extensively dechlorinated sediment PCBs showed decreases of 20-28% in the congeners with half-lives in humans of 10-100 yrs and corresponding increases in congeners with half-lives of 0.01-1.0 yrs. Reductive dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 residue in Woods Pond sediment samples was investigated for a year at incubation temperatures from 4 to 66 \u00b0C(2). Sediment slurries were incubated anaerobically with and without 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorobiphenyl as a primer for dechlorination of the Aroclor 1260 residue. Dechlorination occurred only in live samples primed with 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorobiphenyl at temperature ranges of 8 to 34 \u00b0C and at 50 to 60 \u00b0C(2). At 8 to 34 \u00b0C, the dechlorination resulted in 28 to 65% decreases of the hexa- through nonachlorobiphenyls and corresponding increases in the tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyls(2). At 12 to 30 \u00b0C, 30 to 40% of the hexa- through nonachlorobiphenyls were dechlorinated in just 3 months(2). The optimal temperature for overall chlorine removal was 20 to 27 \u00b0C. Reductive dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 was investigated in anaerobic slurries of estuarine sediments from Baltimore Harbor, Baltimore MD(3). The sediment slurries were amended with 800 ppm Aroclor 1260 with and without the addition of 350 uM 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (2,3,4,5-CB) or 2,3,5,6- tetrachlorbiphenyl (2,3,5,6-CB) and incubated at 30 \u00b0C under methanogenic conditions(3). After 6 months, extensive meta dechlorination and moderate ortho dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 occurred in all incubated cultures except for sterilized controls(3). Overall, total chlorines per biphenyl decreased by up to 34%(3). Results showed that meta chlorines were removed 65, 55 and 45% and ortho chlorines were removed 18, 12, and 9%, respectively, when 2,3,4,5-CB, 2,3,5,6-CB, or no additional congener was supplied. Single congener additions to the sediment slurries not only increased Aroclor 1260 dechlorination but decreased lag time(3)."

The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of 3 PCB mixtures, 24 PCB congeners, and 1 dibenzofuran /have now been studied/ for their effects on PKC translocation by measuring (3)H-phorbol ester ((3)H-PDBu) binding in cerebellar granule cells (7 days in culture). All the PCB mixtures studied increased (3)H-PDBu binding significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner. However,  Aroclor 1016 and Aroclor 1254 were more potent than Aroclor 1260. Of the 24 congeners studied, di-ortho congeners such as 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (-TeCB), 2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl (-PeCB), 2,2',4,6-TeCB, and 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl (-DCB) were the most potent (E50 = 28-43 uM) while non-ortho congeners such as 3,3',4,4'-TeCB and 3,3',4,4'5-PeCB were not effective. The potential contaminant of PCB mixtures, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran had no significant effect on (3)H-PDBu binding.  The SAR among these congeners revealed: (i) congeners with ortho-chlorine substitution such as 2,2'-DCB (EC50 = 43 +/- 3 uM) or ortho-lateral (meta, para) chlorine substitution such as 2,2',5,5'-TeCB (EC50 = 28 +/- 3 uM) and 2,2'4,6-TeCB (E50 = 41 +/- 6 uM) were most potent; (ii) congeners with only para-substitution such as 4,4'-DCB or high lateral content in the absence of ortho-substitution such as 3,3',4,4',5,5'-HCB were not effective; and (iii) increased chlorination was not clearly related to the effectiveness of these congeners, although hexa- and heptachlorination was less effective than di- and tetrachlorination. Low lateral substitution, especially without para-substitution, or lateral content in the presence of ortho-substitution, may  be the most important structural requirement for the in vitro activity of these PCB congeners in neuronal preparations."

The 2,2',4,6,6'-isomer with full substitution at the ortho positions produced less enhancement than the 2,2',3,5',6-isomer, indicating that some degree of rotation about the biphenyl bond may be important for full activity. Results from studies with hippocampal slices from freshly dissected rat brains indicated that perfusion with a tri-ortho congener (2,2',3,5',6-pentaCB) enhanced ryanodine binding and inhibited electrophysiological responses to electrical pulse stimulations, but a mono-ortho congener (2,3',4,4'-tetraCB) showed no enhancement of ryanodine binding and no inhibition of electrophysiological responses to stimulation. Offspring of rats exposed to gavage doses of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day 2,2',3,5',6-pentaCB on gestation days 10-16 displayed neurobehavioral changes as adults (depressed open field locomotor activity, faster acquisition on a working memory task, and no changes in a delayed spatial alternation task) and changes in ryanodine binding to calcium channels in specific regions of the brain (e.g., decreased in hippocampus and increased in cerebral cortex). Although it is not understood how these changes in ryanodine binding are specifically related to the observed neurobehavioral changes, the results from this series of studies emphasize the potential importance of Ah receptor independent mechanisms in PCB-induced neurological and neurodevelopmental effects."

            "Value": "Lifetime oral exposure to any one of four commercial PCB mixtures (Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, and 1260) has been demonstrated to produce liver tumors in female rats; Aroclor 1260 also induced liver tumors in male rats. Mixtures with high chlorination content (e.g., Aroclor 1254) were generally more potent than mixtures with low chlorine content (e.g., Aroclor 1016). Tumor promotion by commercial PCB mixtures following initiation by a variety of chemical agents also has been investigated in a number of animal systems including rat liver, rat kidney, mouse skin, and newborn mouse liver and lung. The tumor promoting effect of extended exposure to PCB mixtures was demonstrated principally in the liver of rats; there is some evidence that PCB mixtures also can promote tumors in mouse lung and mouse skin, but not in rat kidneys. The mechanism of PCB-induced cancer is poorly understood, but there is evidence to suggest that both Ah-receptor dependent and independent mechanisms may be involved. PCB promotion of tumors does not appear to be solely an Ah-receptor mediated process, since individual congeners that are not Ah receptor agonists have tumor promotion capabilities in animal systems. For example, 2,2',5,5'-tetraCB, 2,2',4,4'-tetraCB, and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaCB were shown to promote liver tumors in female Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, 2,2',5,5'-tetraCB, 2,2',3,3',4,4'-hexaCB, and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaCB were potent inhibitors of in vitro gap junctional cellular communication, an assay that is indicative of tumor promotion capacity. A general working mechanistic hypothesis for PCB promotion of liver tumors involves indirect stimulation of cell proliferation following cell or tissue injury by reactive metabolites of PCBs. Alternatively, the cell injury could be caused by increased intracellular concentrations of other reactive species (e.g., superoxide anion or other reactive oxygen species) caused by an overall imbalance from PCB-induced perturbations of cellular biochemical processes, including induction of CYP oxygenases and glutathione S-transferases, repression of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases, and/or disruption of calcium homeostatic processes and signal transduction pathways."

            "Value": "The approximate distribution of chlorinated biphenyls in Aroclor 1260 is: <0.1% di-, 1.8% tri-, 17.1% tetra-, 49.3% penta-, 27.8% hexa-, 3.9% hepta-, <0.05% octa-, and <0.05% nonachlorobiphenyl(1). A review of experimental log Koc for Aroclor 1260 range from 4.8 to 6.8(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this range of Koc values suggests that Aroclor 1260 is expected to be immobile in soil. In the presence of organic solvents, which may be possible at waste sites, Aroclor 1260 will have a greater tendency to leach through soil(SRC)."
