    "Description": "Quinomethionate is a dithioloquinoxaline that results from the formal condensation of 6-methylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiol with phosgene. It has been used as a fungicide and acaricide for the control of mites and powdery mildew on citrus, vegetables, and walnuts, but is not approved for use in the EU. It has a role as an agrochemical. It is a quinoxaline acaricide, a quinoxaline antifungal agent and a dithioloquinoxaline.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC), provided the compound is not altered physically or chemically once released into the environment.

The mobility of oxythioquinox was tested in a soil thin-layer chromatographic system using Hagerstown silty clay loam (surface soil with 2.5% organic material, 39.5% clay, soil water content is 34.1%, pH is 6.8)(4). Oxythioquinox was immobile by both autoradiographic and bioassay visualization using the TLC system indicating strong absorption to the soil medium(4)."
