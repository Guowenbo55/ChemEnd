    "Description": "Glyphosate is a phosphonic acid resulting from the formal oxidative coupling of the methyl group of methylphosphonic acid with the amino group of glycine. It is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide, and the only one to target the enzyme 5-enolpyruvyl-3-shikimate phosphate synthase (EPSPS). It has a role as an agrochemical, an EC 2.5.1.19 (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) inhibitor and a herbicide. It is a phosphonic acid and a glycine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of a glyphosate(2-) and a glyphosate(1-).",

No residues of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the glyphosate metabolite were found in cowberries and billberries at any of the sampling intervals.

The concentration of AMPA were 0.25, 0.85, and 2.1 ppm, respectively. Thirteen months after being treated with glyphosate at a rate of 0.75 kg/ha, residues of glyphosate and AMPA in one sample of reindeer lichen was 6.4 and 0.3 ppm, respectively.

Absorption of 14C-glyphosate in velvetleaf was not significantly different among the three formulations up to 50 h after treatment (HAT). More absorption of 14C-glyphosate occurred in the IPA1 (26.0%) vs. the IPA2 (17.7%) formulation over 74 h. Of the total 14C-glyphosate absorbed, 20 to 35% was translocated from the treated leaf to the rest of the plant. Initial absorption of 14C-glyphosate was rapid in common waterhemp with the IPA1 (42.7%) and IPA2 (30.7%) formulations; both were higher compared with absorption of the DA formulation (11.5%) by 2 HAT. These differences continued up to 26 HAT, but no differences were evident by 74 HAT. Up to 65% of the 14C-glyphosate absorbed was translocated out of the treated leaf by 74 HAT, with roots the primary sink. Initial absorption of 14C-glyphosate was slow in pitted morningglory compared with the other species. More foliar absorption occurred in plants treated with the DA (13.6%) vs. the IPA2 formulation (4.9%) by 6 HAT. Absorption beyond 26 HAT was not different among the three glyphosate formulations. Translocation of 14C-glyphosate to roots was 27% greater as the DA salt than IPA1 and IPA2 by 74 HAT. The distribution pattern of glyphosate was similar in all species; phosphorimages demonstrated movement both acropetal and basipetal, with accumulation in roots greater than in any other plant parts.

Proper adjuvants likely aid in absorption and translocation. In other perennial weeds like Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) and annual species, glyphosate also exhibits translocation behavior, moving to areas of highest metabolic activity such as growing points and meristematic tissues.The study found that pre-treating quackgrass with the herbicide bentazon reduced the subsequent translocation of 14C-glyphosate, while additives like iron or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) did not affect glyphosate activity on wheat (Triticum aestivum).Glyphosate treatment significantly reduced respiration in quackgrass 9 days after application, and impacted photosynthesis more severely in quackgrass compared to wheat, likely due to its systemic movement and effect on metabolically active sites.",

The plants were collected and fractionated into application leaf, other leaves, stems, and roots. In S. latifolia, approximately 88% of the glyphosate remained in the application leaf and a small amount was translocated to roots at 72 HAT. However, 75% of the herbicide applied on T. procumbens remained in the leaf that had received the treatment, with greater glyphosate translocation to the floral bud. It was concluded that the smaller amount of glyphosate observed in S. latifolia and T. procumbens may partly account for their higher tolerance to glyphosate. However, I. nil tolerance to glyphosate may be associated with other factors such as metabolization, root exudation or compartmentalization, because a large amount of the herbicide reached the roots of this species.",

The negative effects appeared to grown tea saplings when the nutrient solution contained of glyphosate, above 200 mg L\u22121. Glyphosate was highest in the roots of the tea plant, where it was also metabolized to AMPA. The glyphosate and AMPA in the roots were transported through the xylem or phloem to the stems and leaves. The amount of AMPA in the entire tea plant was less than 6.0% of the amount of glyphosate. The glyphosate level in fresh tea shoots was less than that in mature leaves at each day. These results indicated that free glyphosate in the soil can be continuously absorbed by, metabolized in, and transported from the roots of the tea tree into edible leaves, and therefore free glyphosate residues in the soil should be controlled to produce teas free of glyphosate.",

The observations in the field indicated that common milkweed was susceptible to glyphosate but not to 2,4-D, while hemp dogbane showed the opposite response. It was found that both herbicides were absorbed more by common milkweed, which was attributed to factors such as less epicuticular wax, a thinner cuticle, a lower contact angle of the herbicide spray, and the presence of stomata and trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface. There were no significant differences in herbicide translocation between the two species, but glyphosate exhibited faster translocation compared to 2,4-D. Areas of high meristematic and metabolic activity accumulated more glyphosate than 2,4-D. Common milkweed showed rapid metabolism of 2,4-D in leaves above the treated leaves, whereas no detectable metabolism of 2,4-D was observed in hemp dogbane roots after 20 days. In contrast, 60% of the 2,4-D in common milkweed roots was metabolized. Limited absorption of glyphosate by hemp dogbane and the metabolism of 2,4-D by common milkweed were identified as primary factors responsible for the observed differences in susceptibility.",
