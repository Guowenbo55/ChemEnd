            "Value": "AEROBIC: Trichloroacetic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 7% of its theoretical BOD in four weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(1). The rate of degradation of trichloroacetic acid was studied in untreated, fertilized, and limed fine sand and humus soil. The soils were treated with 12.6 mg/kg radioactively labeled TCA and the total count of bacteria able to utilize trichloroacetic acid for growth was determined after two weeks of inoculated bacteria incubation at 14-15 \u00b0C. Bacteria able to grow in trichloroacetic acid fine sand samples ranged from about 25 to 275 C.F.U. (colony forming units) X10+5/g soil; growth on trichloroacetic acid humus samples ranged from about 15 to 60 C.F.U X10+6/g soil. Liming increased the rate of trichloroacetic acid degrading bacteria, especially in sandy soil(2). A half-life of trichloroacetic acid in soil was reported as 119.6 days in a laboratory experiment(3). General soil studies indicated that trichloroacetic acid was subject to microbial decomposition. Disappearance of trichloroacetic acid was favored by warm moist conditions and trichloroacetic acid breakdown in soils was most rapid under conditions conducive to high microbiological activity. Trichloroacetic acid breakdown was low in sandy soils. Trichloroacetic acid experienced a lag period in biodegradation: a period in which low degradation was followed by rapid degradation(4)."

            "Value": "Trichloroethylene may act as a promoter, because it inhibits intercellular communication in vitro. It is converted to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in mice, but not much in rats. TCA acts as a peroxisome proliferator, and the neoplasm in the liver of mice may arise through this mechanism. These chemicals are conjugated with GSH, yielding products that are converted to the reactive metabolites in the kidneys through the action of beta-lyase. These steps occur to a greater extent in rats than in mice, and account for the pronounced nephrotoxicity, involving alpha-2-microglobin accumulation, probably a key reaction. The nephrotoxicity explains the low but definite yield of kidney neoplasms."

The compound induced peroxisome proliferation in mouse but not in rat kidney, and it induced peroxisome proliferation in primary cultures of hepatocytes from rats and mice but not in those from humans."

Hepatocellular hypertrophy with intracellular glycogen and a marked accumulation of lipofuscin (indicative of massive intracellular lipid peroxidation) developed. These data suggest that TCA induced hepatotoxicity in mice was related to the generation of free radicals during its in vivo biotransformation. Neither necrosis nor hyperplasia were seen in TCA exposed mice."

The mobility of trichloroacetic acid in Hagerstown silt clay loam was determined using soil thin layer chromatography. Results showed an Rf value of 0.96, corresponding to a classification of 5, high mobility(2). Trichloroacetic acid was found to have a Koc value of 1, very high mobility in soil, and a short half-life of 20 days in soil. The pH of the soil was not recorded(3). Trichloroacetic acid was applied to stands of Typha spp. and Phragmites australis in earthen supply canals in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas and Districts of New South Wales, Australia. The dissipation interval of 17-19 days showed that the trichloroacetic acid was eluted from the sediment into the flowing water in proportion to the square root of time, giving average concns over three days of discharge of more than 0.4 g/cu m(4). After preplant application of 60 kg/ha of trichloroacetic acid to strawberries, the level of total nitrogen in the soil had decreased 1.3 to 2 fold; the level of potassium and phosphorus had decreased 1.5 to 8 fold. Ammonium and nitrate disappeared almost completely. The effect of trichloroacetic acid lasted for 3.5 to 4 months(5)."
