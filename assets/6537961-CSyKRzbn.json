Triticonazole equivalents taken up by wheat plants reached 5.7% and 14.6% of the applied dose in the shoots and the roots, respectively. Between the two- to three-leaf stage and the beginning of the booting phase, the concentration of triticonazole equivalents in the shoots decreased from 2.5 to 0.15 \u00b5g/g fresh weight. This decrease was attributed to the uptake of triticonazole by roots not keeping pace with shoot growth and increased retention in the roots of triticonazole taken up. The main factor limiting the uptake of triticonazole by the roots may be the rapid growth of the uptake-active apical root parts out of the dressing zone which had formed in the soil. Distribution of triticonazole equivalents taken up by the main shoot showed a decreasing concentration gradient from the oldest to the youngest leaf. An increase in the seed treatment dose was investigated as a way to increase the concentration of triticonazole in the shoots, but its influence remained limited.",
