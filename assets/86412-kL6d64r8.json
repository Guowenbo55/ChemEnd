    "Description": "Acibenzolar-S-methyl is a benzothiadiazole that is the S-methyl thioester derivative of acibenzolar. A profungicide (by hydrolysis of the thioester group to give the corresponding carboxylic acid), it is used as a fungicide and plant activator on a variety of crops, including cotton, chili peppers, lettuce, onions, spinach, tobacco, and tomatoes. It has a role as a plant activator, an antifungal agrochemical and a profungicide. It is a benzothiadiazole and a thioester. It is functionally related to an acibenzolar.",

            "content": "Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a plant activator widely used to protect various plant species against a broad spectrum of diseases and pests. It does not possess direct antimicrobial activity but instead triggers the plant's natural systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response, which enhances the plant's ability to resist pathogens. ASM can be applied through foliar spray, seed treatment, root-dip, and soil drench methods. The main metabolic pathway of ASM in plants and soil involves the hydrolysis of the parent molecule into the acidic metabolite CGA210007. Despite numerous reports on the suppression of plant pathogens and the induction of SAR in tomato plants after foliar application, there is limited information available on the persistence and translocation of both ASM and its acid derivative CGA210007 in plant tissues. Furthermore, while there have been studies on the effects of SAR activators like ASM when applied to the soil, there is a lack of data regarding the root uptake and translocation of ASM in above-ground plant parts. This study aimed to investigate the uptake, translocation, and persistence of ASM residues in tomato plants treated with soil application in the root zone.",

The results from the growth chamber experiments demonstrated that ASM treatment at a concentration of 300\u00b5M provided systemic and local protection against the pathogen. This was evident from the reduction in the number and size of bacterial spots, as well as the inhibition of bacterial growth within the plants. The acid derivative of ASM, CGA 210007, which could be produced through hydrolysis in the plant, also exhibited systemic protection. The efficacy of ASM was further confirmed in open field conditions, where both the leaves and fruit of the pepper plants were safeguarded against the disease. The highest level of efficacy, approximately 67%, was achieved by multiple applications of a mixture containing ASM and copper hydroxide. Persistence and translocation data obtained from the growth chamber experiments revealed that ASM remained effective for up to five days after treatment, with rapid translocation and minimal formation of the acid derivative. Notably, the observed protection against bacterial spot disease persisted even after complete degradation of ASM, suggesting that it was attributed to the activation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR).",
