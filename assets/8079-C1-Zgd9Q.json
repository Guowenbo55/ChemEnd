Approximately 20% of THOD was observed when cyclohexene was incubated with activated sewage sludge acclimated to benzene(2). Cyclohexene did not support growth of two strains of Cladosporium resinae isolated from aircraft jet fuels systems when used as the sole carbon source(3,4). 2- and 3-cyclohexene-1-ol were produced in the oxidation of cyclohexene by Pseudomonas oleovorans(5)."
