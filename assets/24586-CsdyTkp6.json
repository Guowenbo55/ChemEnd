Sulfide and phosphate reduced the toxicity of Ni by the formation of insoluble salts. The clay minerals, montmorillonite and kaolinite, and the hydrous oxides of aluminum or manganese reduced the toxicity, presumably by the adsorption of cationic Ni to their negatively charged surfaces. Amino acids, such as aspartic acid; complex organics, such as tryptone; ... yeast extract; and chelating agents, such as citrate, 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, and EDTA, significantly reduced the toxicity of Ni, presumably as the result of decreased attraction between the negatively charged cell surfaces and the complexed Ni."

Nickel chloride and nickel sulfate induced chromosomal aberrations primarily in heterochromatin in both cell lines, while calcium chromate showed no preference for heterochromatin or euchromatin. Nickel compounds also showed a preferential effect on the condensation state of the heterochromatic long arm of X-chromosome, this effect was more dramatic with nickel sulfate. No effect was observed with calcium chromate. Calcium chromate was more effective than the nickel compounds in inducing chromosomal aberrations."

Two groups were used: one with normal protein diet, whereas the other with protein-restricted diet served as control. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues such as the testes, seminal vesicles, epididymisand prostate were dissected out, wiped clean, and stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) activities, glycogen content, cholesterol content, and total protein content of the testes were estimated. Nickel sulfate administration significantly decreased the body weight of both normal protein-fed and protein-restricted groups of animals; the organ weights were also decreased. Significant decrease of LDH activity was observed, but GOT activity was not altered significantly. Testicular glycogen and cholesterol increased significantly in both experimental groups, but total protein content decreased. Nickel sulfate seems to have an adverse effect on the male reproductive system in both groups of animals fed with normal protein (18% casein) diet and protein restricted (5% casein) diet."

Twenty-four hours following the end of such treatment, all animals survived and no apparent clinical signs of toxicity were noted. The final mean body weights of various nickel sulfate-treated rats were not significantly decreased except for the 0.1% nickel sulfate treated group when compared to those in the control. The absolute and relative organ weights were either increased or decreased or remained unchanged, depending on the organ and the dose of nickel sulfate. Total plasma proteins, plasma albumin and globulins, and plasma glutamic pyruvic transaminase activity were all significantly decreased in 0.1% nickel sulfate-treated rats. Lymphocyte subpopulations (T and B cells) were induced at lower dose levels, but suppressed at the highest (0.1%) dose group. A significant decrease in urine volume and an increase in BUN were observed at the highest dose group. Biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue showed some lung damage, whereas no damage to the testis or DNA in liver and kidneys were found. No gross or microscopic changes were seen in any of the various tissues examined. The relative order of bioaccumulation of nickel in different organs of rats when treated at 0.1% nickel sulfate (223.5 mg Ni/L) was kidneys > testes > lung = brain > spleen > heart = liver. But with regard to order of toxicity, both immune and pulmonary systems were found to be very sensitive targets, followed by kidney."
