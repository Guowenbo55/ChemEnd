            "Value": "AEROBIC: Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles, such as acetonitrile, has been shown to proceed by two distinct routes(1,2); a nitrilase transforms the nitriles directly into acids plus ammonium ion, or a nitrile hydratase forms the amide which is hydrolyzed to acid plus ammonium ion by amidase(1,2). A mixed microbial culture isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs utilized acetonitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(3). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/L of acetonitrile; the final pH and ammonia concentration were determined to be 8.81 and 80.1 umol/mL, respectively(3). The biodegradation studies of acetonitrile with mixed cultures of microorganisms from activated sludge and sewage show that degradation proceeds sluggishly without acclimatization of microorganisms, particularly at high concentration(4,5). Degradation is faster with acclimatization(6-11). With activated sludge as microbial inoculum, the lag period of acetonitrile degradation was about 1 day after which the compound degraded with a half-life of 1.2 days(8). Acclimated mixed microbial cultures isolated by an enrichment culture technique degraded 58% acetonitrile in 5 days(9). The biodegradability of acetonitrile was also observed with river water; the 12 day ThOD (theoretical oxygen demand) with river water was 40%(10,11). Acclimation of the microorganisms was examined by redosing; the degradation was 5 times faster after acclimation; it was also 4 times faster at 20 \u00b0C than at 5 \u00b0C(10,11). The biodegradation is expected to be much slower in seawater than in freshwater(12).  Acetonitrile, present at 100 mg/L, reached 65% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(13)."

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile, although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into 3 groups. In group 1, acute toxicity was greatly reduced by carbon tetrachloride pretreatment, in group 2, toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher at death in the brains of mice given group 1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. The relation between log (1/LD50) and log p for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear. For most nitriles, the in vitro metabolism was inhibited when the incubation mixture contained either SKF-525A, carbon monoxide, or microsomes from mice treated with carbon tetrachloride. When mice were dosed with ethyl alcohol, metabolic enhancement of nitriles was seen compared with the control. However, ethyl alcohol, when added to the incubation mixture, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of nitriles."

No common pattern could be drawn for all the eight nitriles tested in vitro, although there were some similarities between the malformations elicited by propionitrile and n-butyronitrile or between those elicited by the five unsaturated nitriles. Presence of a rat hepatic microsomal fraction and NADPH in the culture medium enhanced the embryotoxic effects of the five unsaturated nitriles tested but had no effects on saturated nitriles embryotoxicity. In addition to these in vitro experiments, pregnant rats were given a single oral dose of each compound on Day 10 of gestation and the embryos were evaluated on Day 12 of gestation, i.e., at a time of development corresponding to the developmental stage at the end of the whole embryo culture.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Pregnant Syrian golden hamsters (6 to 12/group) were exposed to 0, 1,800, 3,800, 5,000, or 8,000 ppm acetonitrile (0, 3,022, 6,380, 8,395, or 13,432 mg/cu m, respectively) for 1 hour on gestational day 8 and then sacrificed on gestational day 14. Parameters of maternal and developmental toxicity were evaluated. There were no effects of exposure on dams or offspring at 1,800 ppm. One dam at 3,800 ppm died after exhibiting dyspnea, tremors, hypersalivation, ataxia, and hypothermia. All offspring from the other five surviving animals in this group were normal. At 5,000 ppm, all animals exhibited irritation and excessive salivation; one dam in this group died after displaying dyspnea, hypothermia, and tremors. Six abnormal fetuses exhibiting exencephaly and rib fusions were recovered from two litters of this exposure group. In the 8,000-ppm group, clinical effects included respiratory difficulty, lethargy, ataxia, hypothermia, irritation, and gasping (4/12 dams), followed by tremors, deep coma, and death (3/12 dams). Histopathological examination of the liver, kidneys, and lungs from the dams that died in all groups did not reveal any significant treatment-related effects. Fetotoxicity occurred in offspring of dams exposed to 8,000 ppm, as evidenced by decreased fetal body weight compared to controls (not concentration-related). Five of the nine surviving litters at 8,000 ppm developed severe axial skeletal dysraphic disorders; one 8,000-ppm fetus exhibited extrathoracic ectopia cordis with accompanying defects in the sternum of the heart. This study identifies a NOAEL and /Frank Effect Level/ (FEL) of 1,800 ppm (3,022 mg/cu m) and 3,800 ppm (6,380 mg/cu m) for maternal toxicity, respectively, and a NOAEL and LOAEL of 3,800 ppm (6,380 mg/cu m) and 5,000 ppm (8,395 mg/cu m) for developmental effects."

Controls consisted of 10 nonpregnant females per exposure group. The 1,200-ppm dams exhibited hypoactivity (14/33) and appeared emaciated (6/33). Deaths occurred in two 1,200-ppm dams and one 400-ppm dam. The death at 400 ppm was suggested by the investigators to be the result of a possible spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. There was no effect on body or organ weights in pregnant dams. Fertility did not appear to be affected by ACN exposure; mean pregnancy rate for sperm-positive females was 79%. A slight increase in percentage of resorptions per litter (particularly late resorptions) was seen at the high concentration, but the effect was not significant or concentration-related. The percent of live fetuses per litter was not affected for any group, nor were there treatment-related fetal malformations. The only effect on skeletal variations was a significant increase in percent of supernumerary ribs per litter at 100 ppm, but the effect did not occur for the other groups. While ACN was readily measurable in maternal blood (determined in a separate group of nonpregnant animals), cyanide was not detectable except in the 1,200 ppm group. Considering that mortality was treatment-related at 1,200 ppm and exposure may also have played a role in the one death at 400 ppm, it is prudent to consider 400 ppm (672 mg/cu m) as an FEL. The NOAEL for developmental effects is 1,200 ppm (2,015 mg/cu m)."

There was no mortality at other concentrations. Acetonitrile did not affect fertility (i.e., no differences in number of pregnancies). A markedly increased percentage of nonlive implants per litter (resorptions and dead fetuses) and early resorptions per litter were observed at 1,827 ppm, along with a decrease (not significant) in the mean number of live fetuses per litter. One litter was completely resorbed at 1,827 ppm. No differences were observed between the other exposed groups and the controls. Acetonitrile exposure had no significant effect on the mean number of implantation sites per litter, fetal sex ratio, or fetal weights per litter. Incidences of any visceral or skeletal anomalies were not significantly different between exposed and control groups. A NOAEL of 1,592 ppm (2,673 mg/cu m) was determined for maternal and developmental toxicity and a Frank Effect Level (FEL) of 1,827 ppm (3,067 mg/cu m). Based on increased percentage of nonlive implants per litter, a LOAEL of 1,827 ppm was identified for developmental toxicity."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ The effects of ingested acetonitrile (ACN) on pregnant hamsters and their fetuses were examined. Pregnant Syrian golden hamsters (6-12/group) received gavage doses of 0, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg ACN (in distilled water) on gestation day 8, and were sacrificed on gestation day 15. Parameters of maternal and developmental toxicity were evaluated. Maternal effects (not specified) were evident in dams given 300 and 400 mg/kg, and death occurred in 1/6 and 4/12 dams in these groups, respectively. There was a significant reduction in body weight gain in dams (gestation days 8-15) given up to 300 mg/kg ACN compared to controls (no incidence data provided); however, this effect was not seen at 400 mg/kg. Slight, but significant, decrease in fetal body weight (p < 0.05) was seen in all exposed groups; however, the effect was not dose-related. A significant increase in the number of resorptions per group (not dose-related) was noted in dams exposed to 200 or 400 mg/kg (incidences were 0, 6%, 12%, 0, and 22%). A significant increase in the number of malformed offspring per group occurred in dams exposed to 300 or 400 mg/kg ACN (0, 10%, 0, 19%, and 18%). The most common effect was rib fusions. The reason for the nonlinear effects was not explained by the investigators. A concurrent group was administered 300 mg/kg thiosulfate by intraperitoneal injection 20 minutes prior to inhalation, and repeated every 2 hours for the next 10 hours. Treatment with thiosulfate prevented both maternal and developmental toxicity, indicating a causal connection between cyanide and the effects observed. This study identifies a NOAEL of 200 mg/kg and LOAEL of 300 mg/kg for maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for fetotoxicity could not be established on the basis of the nonlinear effects in the fetuses."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ Genetic and biochemical assays were conducted to determine if nitrile induced adult paralysis and germline aneuploidy in female Drosophila melanogaster requires a biochemical activation mechanism which results in the release of free cyanide. Two nitriles predicted to differ substantially in their susceptibility to enzymatic cyanide release were found to be equally effective inducers of aneuploidy. Regardless of differences in chemical structure, nitriles seem to be affecting a common cellular target as judged by the lack of synergistic effects when two nitriles are presented simultaneously. Mitochondrial respiration was not inhibited by acetonitrile under conditions in which sodium cyanide completely blocked respiration. A sensitive luciferase enzyme inhibition assay suggests that some, but not all, nitriles may affect hydrophobic protein interactions. These results suggest that there is no single biochemical mechanism by which all nitriles induce aneuploidy, although the cellular target disrupted is probably the same for each chemical. The implications of these findings for structural alert based pre-screening of mutagens are discussed. /Nitriles/"

Groups of NMRI mice, five males and five females, were administered a single i.p. dose of acetonitrile, corresponding to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 100 or 125 mg/kg body wt for males and females, respectively. Bone marrow was sampled at 18, 24 or 36 hr after treatment, while peripheral blood was sampled before and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr after treatment. Positive controls were administered cyclophosphamide (65 mg/kg i.p.). Acetonitrile did not increase the incidence of MNPCE in either bone marrow or peripheral blood in male mice or in peripheral blood in females. A small, but statistically significant (P: < 0.05), increase was observed in female bone marrow 36 hr after administration, but since this was within the range of the control data it is not considered to be of biological significance. Cyclophosphamide increased the incidence of MNPCE in bone marrow and peripheral blood of both sexes. It is concluded that acetonitrile is neither clastogenic nor aneugenic in the bone marrow of the mouse at the MTD."

Increasing concentrations of acetonitrile, monofluoroacetonitrile (MFAN), monochloroacetonitrile (MCAN), and monobromoacetonitrile (MBAN) up to 10 mM failed to produced 50% inhibition of the activity of GST enzyme. However, dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN), dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN), and monoiodoacetonitrile (MIAN) were potent inhibitors with I50 values of 2.49, 0.34, 0.82, and 4.44 mM, respectively. At concentrations equivalent to their I50, MIAN, DCAN, and DBAN decrease both apparent Km and Vmax of the enzyme activity toward glutathione (GSH) to 20-50% of control. TCAN significantly increases both apparent Km and Vmax for GSH to 650 and 120% of control values, respectively. The inhibitory effect of haloacetonitriles (HAN) on hepatic GST activity toward CDNB was found to be a mixed type. The inhibitory effect of DCAN, DBAN, and TCAN on the hepatic GST activity was found to be reversible and the activity was completely recovered after dialysis of the inhibited enzyme. MIAN, however, inhibited GST activity in an irreversible manner. Haloacetonitriles' induced inhibition of hepatic GST activity in vitro is consistent with that observed in vivo. The data presented in this study show that haloacetonitriles induced reversible inhibition of hepatic GST activities, and this effect may lead to decreased detoxification of other electrophilic chemicals."

A detailed submolecular picture for the formation mechanism of the L(beta)I phase was provided during the L(beta prime) to L(beta)I phase transition at c(CH(3)CN) = 4 wt %: the conformation state and the hexagonal packing mode of the lipid acyl chains and the hydration properties of the lipid polar groups do not change, and the only difference is that the formed L(beta)I phase has a tighter lipid acyl chain packing than that of the L(beta prime) phase. When c(CH(3)CN) > 12 wt %, the added CH(3)CN molecules selectively dehydrate the interfacial carbonyl groups. Thus, two different kinds of L(beta)I phases differing only in the hydration states of the interfacial carbonyl groups of phospholipids exist in the c(CH(3)CN) regions of 5-12 and 13-40 wt %, respectively. The strong ability of acetonitrile to induce interdigitation in the lipid bilayers has been discussed in the viewpoint of its toxicity."
