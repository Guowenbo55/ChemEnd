            "Value": "The mechanism of thyroid hyperplasia and carcinogenicity of alachlor in the rat is based on the induction of T4/T3 glucuronic acid transferase (UDPGT) in the liver. Due to the enhanced glucuronidation of T4 and T3 and subsequent biliary excretion of the conjugates, the plasma concentrations of T4 and T3 are decreased. To compensate for this change, the pituitary produces more thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to enhance T4 production by the thyroid. Continuous stimulation of the thyroid by increased plasma TSH levels leads to hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium and subsequently to tumor formation. The occurrance of thyroid follicular tumors following induction of hepatic UDPGT is a well-known phenomena in rats and is generally considered to be of little to no relevance for human risk assessment. Alachlor does not bind to human thyroid hormone receptor, human thyroid binding globulin or human transthyretin."

All three compounds produce tumors of the thyroid follicular cells in rats by way of a non-genotoxic mode of action that includes UDPGT induction, increased TSH, alterations in T3/T4 hormone production and thyroid hyperplasia. The FIFRA Science Advisory Panel noted in /1997/, additionally, that even though the evidence illustrated that a common mechanism could be used to group certain chemicals for the development of thyroid tumors, it was recommended that this endpoint not be used in combining margins of exposure because the toxic effects were noted at doses above the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)."

            "Value": "...there is ample evidence ...that the development of nasal olfactory epithelium tumors in rats dosed with chloroacetanilides involves the following sequence of steps,: 1) Acetochlor conjugates with glutathione (GSH) and is excreted in the bile. 2) The conjugate is biotransformed to a series of sulfur-containing products. Enterohepatic circulation of these products creates a pool of metabolites that are delivered to the nose. 3) Biotransformation to tissue-reactive and toxic metabolites. Metabolism by nasal enzymes, results in formation of a benzoquinoneimine, an electrophile and redox-active molecule. 4) Binding of toxic metabolite to cellular proteins plus possible generation of oxidative stress . 5) Cytotoxicity 6) Regenerative cell proliferation. 6) Sustained cytotoxicity and cell proliferation that results in neoplasia. The following three events are considered key events for formation of nasal olfactory epithelium tumors by the proposed non-linear, non genotoxic mode of action (MOA): Quinone imine- formation (protein binding) goes to cytotoxicity goes to cell proliferation."

Stomach: Evidence was presented that the carcinomas resulting from alachlor were ...  carcinoids, not adenocarcinomas or gastric sarcomas, and that these carcinoids are probably related to the proposed gastrin-induced effect. ...  Although the tumor increases were significant only at the highest dose (excessive), it was noted that there was also 1 tumor (vs 0 in controls) at the mid-dose (which was considered to be adequate, not excessive) and this is a rare tumor type. Nasal tumors: The /EPA/ Science Advisory Panel considered these possibly relevant to humans but only at exposures in excess of anticipated human exposures for pesticide use. ... In accordance with the EPA proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (April 23,1996), alachlor was characterized as \"likely\" to be a human carcinogen at high doses, but \"not likely\" at low doses, by all routes of exposure. This conclusion was based on increased incidences of malignant and combined benign/malignant multiple tumor types in both sexes of the Long Evans rat, which occurred mainly at higher doses. Based on a consideration of modes of action for these tumors, the Committee agreed that a non-linear margin of exposure (MOE) approach should be used for the purpose of risk assessment. The consensus ... was that MOEs for both the malignant mixed gastric tumors and the nasal adenomas be presented for a risk management decision. The Committee recognizes that while the response occurs only at higher doses and quantitative differences exist in sensitivity between rats and humans, a similar mechanism for nasal tumor production is present in humans, and therefore its relevance to humans cannot be dismissed."

            "Value": "Based upon the available data for alachlor, the following hypothesis has been proposed for the production of tumors in the nasal mucosa: alachlor is metabolized in the rat to the glutathione (mercapturic acid) conjugate, which is excreted through the bile into the gut. In the gut, enteric bacteria metabolize the conjugate to the thiol conjugate, with subsequent S-methylation of the thiol. This product, the methyl sulfide, is re-absorbed into the systemic circulation where conversion to the secondary sulfide occurs. Hydrolysis of the secondary sulfide by arylamidase produces the diethylaniline metabolite of alachlor. Oxidation of the diethylaniline metabolite produces the putative toxic metabolite, diethylbenzoquinone imine (DEBQI). This metabolite binds to cellular protein, resulting in eventual cell death. Ensuing regenerative cell proliferation can then lead to neoplasia through \"fixation\" of spontaneous mutations."

            "Value": "Chronic administration of alachlor in the diet at a level of 126 mg/kg/day has previously been shown to cause an increase in benign thyroid follicular cell tumors in male Long-Evans rats. Studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of the alachlor-induced thyroid tumors in the male rat by evaluating changes in parameters that are collectively associated with a hormonally mediated mode of action for thyroid neoplasia. Male Long-Evans rats were administered 126 mg alachlor/kg body wt/day via the diet for up to 120 days. One group of animals was removed from alachlor-treated diet after 60 days and received untreated diet for an additional 60 days. Liver and thyroid weights and serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) activity, were determined at 7, 14, 28, 60, and 120 days of treatment. Liver and thyroid weights, hepatic UDPGT activity, and circulating levels of TSH were significantly increased in animals administered alachlor. These increases were seen as early as 7 days after alachlor administration. Circulating levels of T4 in alachlor-treated animals were significantly decreased compared with controls at 7 days, but had returned to control levels by 60 days. T3 levels were elevated at all time points except at 28 days. The changes in TSH and T3 levels, hepatic UDPGT activity, and liver weights were all reversible on elimination of alachlor from the diet. Thyroid weights did not completely return to control levels after removal of alachlor from the diet, although some recovery was evident. The results of this study clearly suggest that alachlor-induced thyroid neoplasia, observed in previous chronic bioassays with alachlor, was associated with increases in circulating TSH levels. Increased metabolism of T4 via hepatic enzymatic conjugation (i.e., T4-UDPGT) appeared to be responsible for the increased TSH levels. These effects were shown to be reversible on cessation of exposure to alachlor. In summary, evidence is presented for a hormonally mediated process for the development of thyroid follicular cell tumors."

Genomic analysis of olfactory mucosa from rats given alachlor (126 mg/kg/d) for from 1 day to 18 mo suggested that matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated in the month following initiation of treatment. The present studies were designed to confirm this latter finding and to explore the potential role of MMPs in alachlor-induced olfactory carcinogenesis. Zymographic analysis of olfactory mucosal extracts confirmed that MMP-2 activity is higher in the olfactory mucosa of alachlor-treated rats. Therefore, rats were fed alachlor (126 mg/kg/d in the diet for 1 year) either with or without the MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor Ro 28-2653 (100 mg/kg daily by gavage for the first 2 months of alachlor treatment). The number of olfactory mucosal neoplasms was reduced by 25% after 1 year of alachlor treatment in rats that received both alachlor and Ro 28-2653. The morphology of alachlor-induced olfactory tumors was similar whether or not Ro 28-2653 had been given; the MMP inhibitor itself had no impact on olfactory mucosal histology. These data confirm that olfactory mucosal MMP-2 activity is increased following short-term alachlor exposure and show that administration of an MMP-2/9 inhibitor reduced the incidence of olfactory neoplasms in alachlor-treated rats, thereby implicating MMP-2 activity as a mediator of alachlor-induced carcinogenicity."

The occurrence of these signs began to decrease after post-exposure day 2, with the exception of matted fur, which persisted until day 6. Slight body weight decreases were observed on post-exposure day 1, but normal body weight gains were evident in most animal on day 3. At necropsy, the only treatment related effect observed was that scattered grey or red foci in the lungs of three females. All other animals appeared normal. ... The test method was U.W.

The results, using freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, showed that in these conditions several potentially DNA damaging metabolites were produced; this experimental condition was used to assess DNA damage induced by the mixture of alachlor and its metabolites. The alkaline elution technique showed that at 200 uM and more clearly at 400 uM there were some small fragments that eluted in the first fraction. This fragmentation was probably due to alachlor cytotoxicity. In addition to the small DNA fragments eluting in the first fraction there were other larger DNA fragments.

Experimental results confirm that alachlor adsorbs weakly to moderately to soil and the leaching of alachlor from soil is high to medium(4,5). The adsorption of alachlor increases with an increase in organic content, clay content and surface area of soil(4). Alachlor was not detected in groundwater from a soil with high organic and clay content(5). This is probably due to longer residence time in this soil allowing the degradation of alachlor before it reached the water table.

The study found that the total uptake of 14C-alachlor was higher at the higher temperature. However, the herbicide was primarily localized in the roots, where it underwent rapid metabolism. At the lower temperature, the distribution of the labeled compound was relatively equal among different plant parts except for cotyledons, and a smaller proportion of alachlor was metabolized. Under higher temperatures, both root uptake of 14C-alachlor and translocation to the shoots were significantly greater. Additionally, it was observed that approximately 60% of the alachlor volatilized from a watchglass at 27\u00b0C, and subsequent uptake of the volatilized compound occurred in adjacent snap bean plants within a closed system.",
