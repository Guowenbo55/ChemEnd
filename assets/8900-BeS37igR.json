In a study determining the primary aerobic biodegradation of biodiesel B20 fuel, the calculated half-life of n-heptane contained in the mixture was 2.3 days using unacclimated inocula from a rainwater detention pond(2). The theoretical oxygen demand of benzene acclimated activated sludge for n-heptane was 0.7, 4.3 and 23.4% after 6, 24, and 72 hr, respectively(3). One mg of n-heptane and 1 ml of a 1:10 suspension of Hudson-Collamer silt loam soil in mineral salts media were incubated in the dark at 25 \u00b0C(4). Controls without n-heptane were used to determine the net oxygen consumed(4). The average theoretical biological oxygen demand of trials for n-heptane was 28, 63, 70 and 70% after 2, 5, 10 and 20 days, respectively(4). n-Heptane (5 ml) was completely degraded 4 days after it was added to a microcosm inoculated with soil from a gasoline contaminated site(5). At intervals of 6, 12 and 24 hr, endogenous respiration was greater than that of 3 preparations of n-heptane and activated sludge from differing aeration units of sewage treatment facilities(6). n-Heptane was degraded to approximately 17% of its initial concentration (unspecified) after 2 days and 100% after 25 days, respectively, in gasoline (400 mg/L) inoculated with activated aerobic sewage sludge (100 mg dry wt/L)(7)."

These properties lead to a general comparison of the rotational and translational behaviors of the two solutes during the penetration of the membrane... For heptane the hindrance to penetrate into the membrane is significantly higher than for sulfur mustard. In contrast to heptane molecules, which spend the most of the time penetrating the tail groups, sulfur mustard needs more time to escape the tail group-head group interface of the membrane."

The nerve conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured before the beginning of the exposure and after exposure for four, eight, 12, and 16 weeks. The experiment showed that n-hexane disturbed the conduction velocity of the motor nerve and the mixed nerve and prolonged the distal latency in the rat's tail, but that n-pentane and n-heptane did not. The light and electron microscopic examination showed that the peripheral nerve, the neuromuscular junction, and the muscle fiber of the rats exposed to n-hexane were severely impaired, but those of the rats exposed to n-pentane or n-heptane showed no particular changes even after 16 weeks of exposure. /Petroleum distillate/"

The ABR was measured simultaneously with both needle electrodes and implanted electrodes. The wave forms recorded with the two types of electrodes were similar, but the amplitudes were largest on the recordings with implanted electrodes. The overall ratio between the amplitudes obtained with implanted electrodes and with needle electrodes was 1.4 for peak Ia and 2.5 for peak IV of the ABR. The exposure to n-heptane (4000 ppm) reduced the amplitudes of components Ia and IV of the ABR. The reduction was most consistent for component IV and most pronounced at higher frequencies and intensities. The reduction in ABR corresponds to an increase in the auditory threshold of approximately 10 dB at all frequencies. Neither the latencies nor the interpeak latencies of components Ia and IV were changed. No significant changes in ABR were observed in the group exposed to 800 ppm."

Dog 1 had been exposed to a commercial hydrocarbon waterproofing spray 24 hours before the development of clinical signs, and dog 2 was examined 18 hours after exposure to a waterproofing spray containing heptane, a highly flammable liquid hydrocarbon.  CLINICAL FINDINGS: In both dogs, major gastrointestinal tract abnormalities were ruled out but respiratory status worsened.  Thoracic radiography revealed a diffuse interstitial pulmonary pattern, and hypoxemia was detected.  TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Hospitalization for monitoring and care was required for both dogs.  The dogs recovered with supportive care, which included administration of oxygen, fluids, and bronchodilators.  Additionally, dog 1 received glucocorticoids via inhalation and supplemental enteral nutrition, whereas dog 2 was treated with an antimicrobial.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  The dogs of this report developed hydrocarbon pneumonitis following exposure to waterproofing sprays.  Such sprays contain potentially toxic hydrocarbons.  The severity of the adverse effects associated with exposure may have been amplified because the dogs were physically small and were exposed to a relatively large amount of aerosolized spray within small areas.  Development of chemical pneumonitis in pet animals is best prevented by application of waterproofing sprays in well-ventilated or outdoor areas from which pets have been excluded.  With prolonged hospitalization and considerable monitoring and care, affected dogs can recover from these exposures."
