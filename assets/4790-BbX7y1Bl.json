    "Description": "Phorate is an organic thiophosphate and an organothiophosphate insecticide. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide and an agrochemical. It is functionally related to an (ethylsulfanyl)methanethiol.",

Approximately one-third of the amount applied was present in the plant by the end of the sixth week. This implies that the insecticides are capable of providing protection to cotton against pests for approximately two months."

According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Bioconcentration of phorate from culture media by the blue green algae Anabaena sp. (ARM 310) and Aulosira fertilissima (ARM 68) was studied(1). Bioconcentration factors for phorate in Anabaena sp. were 3, 6 and 12 at 2.5, 5 and 10 ug/ml, respectively(3). In Anabaena fertilissima, at 2.5, 5 and 10 ug/ml of phorate, max bioconcentration of phorate was reached after 16, 16 and 32 hr, respectively, with bioconcentration factors of 8, 12 and 11 for the respective doses(3). Elodea nuttallii plants grown for 2 weeks in water with a deposit of C14-phorate in the bottom soil accumulated 30% of the originally soil-applied radiocarbon in their tissues; 56% of phorate accumulated in plant tissues when the insecticide was applied directly to the water(4)."

            "Value": "Degradation half-lives of phorate in various soils were: sandy loam, 7 days; silty clay loam, 9 days; and clay loam, 8 days(1). One-half of the applied phorate dosage to silt loam soil could no longer be detected after 6 days when applied to the soil surface and after 30 days when mixed with the upper 4-5 inch soil layer(2). In silt loam soil, phorate persisted beyond 16 weeks at 25 \u00b0C(3). The half-life of phorate in clay loam soil when applied as a granular formulation ranged from 5 to 10 days(4). In a field study, 67 and 70% of phorate was lost within 28 days from silty clay loam soil(5). Bioassays indicate the half-life of phorate, when applied to the top 4 inches of sandy loam soil at a concentration of 10 ppm, is about 68 days(6). In flooded agricultural loam soil, 1.7, 6.0, and 9.9% of the applied C14-phorate had been evolved as C14-CO2 after 3, 7, and 14 days incubation, respectively(7). In non-flooded soils, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3% of the applied C14-phorate had been evolved as C14-CO2 after identical incubation periods(7). Half-lives of 1.2 days and 1.1 days were determined for phorate in active sediment and water, respectively(8). In a 1 week laboratory assay, phorate mineralization was not significantly greater in soils with a history of phorate use than in soils with no history of phorate use(9). The microbial degradation of phorate in loam soil, sandy soil, and muck soil led to the formation of phorate sulfone and phorate sulfoxide; formation was much less in sandy soil(10). Phorate, when applied at a rate of 1.25 kg AI/ha to black clay loam soils under flooded conditions, degraded quickly(11). In shake flask tests, phorate showed more degradation in the presence of non-sterile estuarine sediment, half-life of about 1 day, than in the presence of sterile sediment, half-life of about 1.5 days(12). The half-lives of phorate in shake flasks containing a non-sterile sediment-water slurry were less than 1 day(12). In studies where 32 farm soils were incubated with phorate, initial half-lives of freshly-applied phorate ranged from <1 to >16 weeks(13). Accelerated degradation was stimulated by a single application and occurred most readily at pH's >7.4(13)."

A significant rise in creatinine level was observed from the 4th week of exposure until the end of the experiment. This rise suggests impairment of the glomerular function and tubular damage in the kidneys. These changes were confirmed by histopathological studies in the tubules. Kidney lesions were present throughout the experimental period. These consisted of mild to severe multifocal cloudy and hydropic degeneration with necrosis in the tubules, though the glomerular damage was not seen by light microscopy. After a 30-day recovery period, the histopathological and biochemical changes were absent and normal patterns were restored."

Maternal mortality was 7 of 25 in the high dose group (some due to intubation errors), 1 of 25 in the low dose group, and 0/25 in controls. Maternal NOEL = 0.25 mg/kg (mortality); Developmental NOEL = 0.25 mg/kg (enlarged hearts).  A possible adverse effect (enlarged fetal hearts) was noted."

All animals were sacrificed on day 20 of gestation and examined for total litter size, fetal weight, and fetal resorptions. No compound-related terata were found in the study. The highest dose produced a marginal increase in resorptions at the same dose associated with signs of maternal phorate poisoning."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ In an acute neurotoxicity study, 4 groups of 7 wk old Sprague-Dawley CD rats (20/sex/group) were given a single oral dose (by gavage) of phorate (91.8% ai) in corn oil at doses of 0, 0.25, 0.50, or 1.0 mg/kg bw. The first indication of a compound-related effect (miosis) detected by the FOB was reported at the 0.5 mg/kg (2/10 males and 2/10 females) and 1.0 mg/kg (2/10 males and 5/10 females) doses approximately 4-5 hrs after exposure to the test substance (time of peak effect). In addition to miosis, one female at the 1.0 mg/kg dose level showed evidence of slight tremors, fasciculations, slightly impaired locomotion, and splayed/dragging hind limbs. Another female in this dose group also exhibited moderate tremors. These symptoms resolved within the first wk and were no longer evident at the Day 8 observation period. Significant cholinesterase activity inhibition in plasma, red blood cells, and the brain was seen in both males and females at the 1.0 mg/kg dose level. A small but statistically-significant decrease in brain cholinesterase activity (6%) was also observed in males at the 0.5 mg/kg dose level. Under the conditions of this study, the LOAEL is established at 0.50 mg/kg/day based on the evidence of miosis and of statistically significant brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition in males. The NOAEL is 0.25 mg/kg/day."

            "Value": "In four different soils with percent organic carbon ranging from 0.087 to 0.65, phorate had an average Koc of 3200(1). Koc values of 543(2) and 2400(3) have also been reported for phorate. Phorate was found to be only slightly mobile in soil column studies(4). Phorate was less mobile in degraded chernozem and in black marsh soil, than in brown forest soil(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these Koc values suggest that phorate is expected to have low to slight mobility in soil. Phorate is most readily adsorbed to mineral solids and to silty loam and clay soils when the soils are dry(4). A soil mobility factor of 1.2 was calculated for phorate using soil column studies with Hagerstown silty clay loam (4.3% organic matter, 30% clay, pH 5.5) and Lakeland sandy loam(3.3% organic matter, 10% clay, pH 6.2)(6). A mobility factor of 1 represents no movement, while a mobility factor of 6 represents maximum movement(7). In a field study using watershed soils and their corresponding pond sediments, phorate was adsorbed more extensively by pond sediments (organic matter 1.4%, clay content 25%) than by Ca-saturated soils (organic matter 2.4%, clay content 16%)(7)."

While demeton and its metabolites were rapidly translocated within 24 hours of treatment, phorate required a longer preliminary treatment period, possibly up to 24 hours, for comparable control of aphids.
