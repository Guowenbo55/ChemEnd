    "Description": "Guanethidine is a member of the class of guanidines in which one of the hydrogens of the amino group has been replaced by a 2-azocan-1-ylethyl group. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an adrenergic antagonist and a sympatholytic agent. It is a member of guanidines and a member of azocanes. It is functionally related to a guanidine. It derives from a hydride of an azocane.",
