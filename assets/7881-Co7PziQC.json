According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC)."

            "Value": "The Koc of dibutyl phosphate is estimated as 490(SRC), using a water solubility of 1.72X10+4 mg/L(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that dibutyl phosphate is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The estimated pKa of dibutyl phosphate is 0.88(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). The sorption of organophosphorus compounds in soil depends on both organic matter and clay content of soil and the sorption increases as the pH of soil decreases(6)."
