            "content": "The uptake rates and distribution profiles of the fungicides SAN 789 F and cyproconazole were compared after applications to different parts of wheat seedlings. Despite their different lipophilicities, both compounds showed similar incorporation rates and distribution profiles in the seedlings. Uptake was most efficient via the embryo, with approximately 65% of the applied amount absorbed during the first 3 hours. The endosperm and radicle also absorbed significant amounts (approximately 45% and 30%, respectively), while only 5% entered via the coleoptile. When the embryo was treated, it accumulated half of the applied amount, with 15% and 25% located in the pericarp and testa, respectively. Application to the endosperm or radicle resulted in different distribution patterns. SAN 789 F was less mobile than cyproconazole, leading to a more concentrated seed dressing zone and more efficient absorption by wheat seedlings. These results suggest that water-soluble compounds are preferentially taken up via the embryo during germination, but can also enter via the testa and accumulate in the endosperm, with uptake dynamics strongly influenced by seed dressing zones rather than the lipophilicity of the fungicides.",

To enhance the chemical control of BRRD and prevent the emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study examined the control efficacy and systemic activity of fungicides with various modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with different modes of action were tested for their inhibitory effects on 39 P. noxius isolates from multiple regions. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (target-site G1) exhibited colony growth inhibition of P. noxius by 99.9% to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7% to 99.8% at 1 ppm. Another effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings, with cyproconazole and tebuconazole being the most efficiently absorbed by roots and transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments indicated that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD compared to mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Since all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered over trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.",
