Catechol was found to inhibit rather specifically the fast potassium(+) current as does 4-aminopyridine. Calcium(2+), sodium(+) and slow potassium(+) currents were not affected. Although both 4-aminopyridine and catechol were inhibitors of the fast potassium(+) channels, their sites of action were quite different. Catechol was effective when applied on the external surface of the cell membrane whereas 4-aminopyridine acted preferably internally. We assumed that a single fast potassium(+) channel has two distinct sites for blockers: the catechol site is exposed to the external medium or situated at the outer orifice of the pore, and the 4-aminopyridine site is located within the same channel but is more easily accessible from inside the nerve cell than outside. The 4-aminopyridine and catechol sites were not, however, completely separate and independent of each other since a synergistic interaction was observed between catechol and 4-aminopyridine."

            "Value": "Catechol, a naturally occurring and an important industrial chemical, has been shown to have strong promotion activity and induce glandular stomach tumors in rodents. In addition, catechol is a major metabolite of carcinogenic benzene. To clarify the carcinogenic mechanism of catechol, we investigated DNA damage using human cultured cell lines and 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 and p16 tumor suppressor genes and the c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene. Catechol increased the amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is known to be correlated with the incidence of cancer, in a human leukemia cell line HL-60, whereas the amount of 8-oxodG in its hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-resistant clone HP100 was not increased. The formation of 8-oxodG in calf thymus DNA was increased by catechol in the presence of Cu(2+). Catechol caused damage to 32P-labeled DNA fragments in the presence of Cu(2+). When NADH was added, DNA damage was markedly enhanced and clearly observed at relatively low concentrations of catechol (<1 microM). DNA cleavage was enhanced by piperidine treatment, suggesting that catechol plus NADH caused not only deoxyribose phosphate backbone breakage but also base modification. Catechol plus NADH frequently modified thymine residues. Bathocuproine, a specific Cu(+) chelator and catalase inhibited the DNA damage, indicating the participation of Cu(+) and H2O2 in DNA damage. Typical hydroxyl radical scavengers did not inhibit catechol plus Cu(2+)-induced DNA damage, whereas methional completely inhibited it. These results suggest that reactive species derived from the reaction of H2O2 with Cu(+) participates in catechol-induced DNA damage. Therefore, /the authors/ conclude that oxidative DNA damage by catechol through the generation of H2O2 plays an important role in the carcinogenic process of catechol and benzene."

            "Value": "We examined the redox properties of the \"carcinogenic\" catechol and the \"noncarcinogenic\" hydroquinone in relation to different DNA damaging activities and carcinogenicity using 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human genes. In the presence of endogenous NADH and Cu2+, catechol induces stronger DNA damage than hydroquinone, although the magnitudes of their DNA damaging activities were reversed in the absence of NADH. In both cases, DNA damage resulted from base modification at guanine and thymine residues in addition to strand breakage induced by Cu+ and H2O2, generated during the oxidation of catechol and hydroquinone into 1,2-benzoquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone, respectively. EPR and 1H NMR studies indicated that 1,2-benzoquinone is converted directly into catechol through a nonenzymatic two-electron reduction by NADH whereas 1,4-benzoquinone is reduced into hydroquinone through a semiquinone radical intermediate through two cycles of one-electron reduction. The reduction of 1,2-benzoquinone by NADH proceeds more rapidly than that of 1,4-benzoquinone. This study demonstrates that the rapid 1,2-benzoquinone two-electron reduction accelerates the redox reaction turnover between catechol and 1,2-benzoquinone, resulting in the enhancement of DNA damage. These results suggest that the differences in NADH-mediated redox properties of catechol and hydroquinone contribute to their different carcinogenicities"

            "Value": "Catechol is possibly carcinogenic to humans (International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC). The key mechanism could include its oxidative DNA-damaging effect in combination with reductive-oxidative metals like Cu. We found that DNA damage was suppressed by introducing an alpha-carbonyl group to catechol at C4-position to produce carbonyl catechols. During the oxidative DNA-damaging process, catechols but not carbonyl catechols were oxidized to o-quinone; however, coexisting Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I). Carbonyl catechols were possibly arrested at the oxidation step of semiquinones in the presence of Cu(II). Cu(I)-binding to DNA was stronger than Cu(II)-binding, on the basis of the circular dichroism spectral change. None of the carbonyl catechols induced such change, suggesting sequestration of Cu(I) from DNA. Solid-phase extraction experiments and spectrophotometric analyses showed the formation of semiquinone chelates with Cu(I). Thus, chelate formation could explain the suppression mechanism of the Cu-catechol-dependent DNA damage by terminating the reduction-oxidation cycle. Structural modifications such as introducing an alpha-carbonyl group to catechol at C4-position would contribute to reducing the risk and improving industrial and medical potentials of aromatic/phenolic compounds ... ."
