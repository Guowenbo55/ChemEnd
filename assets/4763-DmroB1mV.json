The drug lowers serum bilirubin concentrations in neonates and patients with congenital nonhemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and patients with chronic intrahepatic cholestasis, presumably by induction of glucuronyl transferase, the enzyme which conjugates bilirubin."

            "Value": "The exact mechanism(s) by which barbiturates exert their effect on the CNS, has not been fully elucidated. However, it is believed that such effects are related, at least partially, to the drugs' ability to enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by altering inhibitory synaptic transmissions that are mediated by GABAA receptors. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "Although the drugs act throughout the CNS, a site of particular sensitivity is the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation which is concerned with the arousal mechanism. Barbiturates induce an imbalance in central inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms influencing the cerebral cortex and the reticular formation. The significance of the effect of barbiturates on neurotransmitters is unclear. It appears that the drugs decrease the excitability of both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. It has not been determined which of the various actions of barbiturates at cellular and synaptic levels are responsible for their sedative and hypnotic effects. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "Relatively low doses of the barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, and produce sedation and drowsiness. In some patients, however, drowsiness may be preceded by a period of transient elation, confusion, euphoria, or excitement, especially after subhypnotic doses of aprobarbital, pentobarbital, or secobarbital. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "Larger doses distort judgment, cloud perception, suppress motor activity, and produce drowsiness and sleep. Still larger doses induce anesthesia. Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep. Barbiturates reduce the rapid eye movement (REM) or dreaming stage of sleep. Stages III and IV sleep are also decreased. Although tolerance develops to the REM-suppressant effects during chronic administration, REM rebound occurs when the drugs are withdrawn, and the patient may experience markedly increased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

Geriatric patients may react to usual doses of barbiturates with excitement, confusion, or depression, probably as a result of the drugs' depressant effects on inhibitory centers of the cerebral cortex. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity, but only phenobarbital, metharbital, and mephobarbital are effective anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "In usual hypnotic doses, barbiturates depress respiration similar to that occurring in natural sleep. With larger doses, however, the drugs markedly decrease the rate, depth, and volume of respiration, probably through a direct action on medullary centers. Rapid iv administration of these drugs may produce respiratory depression and transient hypotension. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "Reduction of tone and motility of the GI tract following sedative doses of the barbiturates is largely caused by their central depressant action rather than by any direct effects on the GI tract. In toxic doses, the drugs depress transmission of impulses in autonomic ganglia. Although barbiturates decrease oxygen consumption of all tissues, hypnotic doses have no measurable effect on the basal metabolic rate. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

            "Value": "Barbiturates have no direct effects on renal function, although severe renal impairment may occur in acute barbiturate poisoning as a result of marked hypotension. Hepatic function is not adversely affected by barbiturates, but the drugs, particularly phenobarbital, induce hepatic microsomal enzymes and thus may alter the metabolism of other drugs. Deep barbiturate anesthesia may prolong labor by decreasing the force and frequency of uterine contractions, although hypnotic doses have no effect on uterine activity. /Barbiturates General Statement/"
