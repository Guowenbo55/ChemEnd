            "Value": "During ethoprop metabolism studies, it was observed that ethoprop did not metabolize in sterilized soils, but did in nonsterile soils(1). Soil from ethoprop treated plots in the Midwestern US were studied to determine ethoprop persistence(1); half-lives of 5-12 days were observed at application rates of 1-2 lb/acre granular formulation(1); when applied as a liquid formulation to VA soil, half-lives of 3-4 days were observed(1). Addition of ethoprop to soil has been observed to stimulate microbial oxygen consumption(2). During 4-week soil incubation studies using 1-ethyl-14C-labeled ethoprop, (14)CO2 evolution ranged from 23.4 to 50.9% in soils having no previous organophosphorus exposure and soils having prior exposure to isofenphos and fonophos(3); (14)CO2 from ethoprop was greater in soil having no prior exposure to the other pesticides(3). Mineralization of ethoprop was found to occur faster in soils that had been treated previously with ethoprop as compared to no prior treatment indicating microbial adaptation(4); during a 1 wk incubation, 32.7% mineralized in previously treated soil and 19.9% mineralized in untreated soil(4). Faster biodegradation in previously ethoprop treated soils was also noted in another study(5); sterilization of soils drastically reduced disappearance rates of ethoprop(5). The soil half-life of ethoprop can range from 3 to 56 days(6). In various field studies, soil half-lives of 2-12 weeks were determined(7). In soil column studies, ethoprop had the following half-lives(8): in silty loam (12 days at 20 \u00b0C to 89 days at 2 \u00b0C), in sandy loam (16 days at 20 \u00b0C to 144 days at 2 \u00b0C), in humous loamy sand (73 days at 20 \u00b0C to 347 days at 6 \u00b0C)(8). The half-lives of ethoprop in sterile and non-sterile soil from a banana plantation in Jamaica, with heavy ethoprop use, were 28.8 and 10.9 days, respectively(9)."

            "Value": "The first essential step in the initiation of the delayed neuropathic effect of an organophosphate is phosphorylation of a target protein in the nervous system. The protein has esteratic enzyme activity. The phosphorylation, which was originally studied radiochemically, can be monitored conveniently as progressive inhibition of the activity of this enzyme, which is now referred to as Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE or Neurotoxic Esterase)... . The second, and equally essential, step is the transformation of the phosphorylated NTE to a modified form: one of the remaining ester bonds of the inhibitor molecule attached to the NTE active site undergoes a biochemical cleavage leaving an ionized acidic residue bound to the protein: this residue is negatively charged and the reaction is referred to as \"aging\". Both inhibition and aging of inhibited NTE are essential to initiate neuropathy, but the role of the negative charge in the initiation of axonal degeneration is not known. The process of \"aging\" of inhibited NTE has some analogy with the better-known \"aging\" of inhibited AChE. However, the analogy does not last above the level of enzyme inhibition. Acute toxicity arises directly from the loss of catalytic activity of AChE, leading to accumulation of excess physiological substrate. Mere loss of catalytic activity of NTE (without aging) does not initiate neuropathy. There is no evidence of a deleterious accumulation of a physiological substrate for NTE or lack of hydrolysis products after inhibition in vivo, and the effect of the negative charge may be focused on some quite separate process. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

The US Dept Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a Koc value of 70 for ethoprop(2). Koc values of 120.6 and 76.0 have been reported for Riverhead and Rhinebeck soils, respectively(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that ethoprop is expected to have high mobility in soil."
