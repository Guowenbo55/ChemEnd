The removal rate constant of isobutane is 0.061/day (standard deviation 0.005/day) at 20 \u00b0C and 0.030/day (standard deviation 0.006/day) at 10 \u00b0C(1). The respective half-lives are 11 days and 23 days(SRC). The results indicate that gas exchange is the dominant removal mechanism for isobutane gases from the water column following a hypothetical input. Scaling up the predicted gas exchange rate constants (0.26/day and 0.017/day at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively) so they are consistent with natural estuaries, the volatilization half-lives for isobutane from the water columns in natural estuaries(1) are estimated to be 4.4 and 6.8 days at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively(SRC). Isobutane also biodegrades in the  microcosm at a rate that is slower than for n-butane and falls between propane and ethane in susceptibility. Biodegradation of isobutane is significantly slower than the loss predicted by gas exchange from typical natural estuaries. However, after a lag of 2-4 weeks, the biodegradation rate increases markedly so that in the case of chronic inputs, biodegradation can become the dominant removal mechanism(1)."

The mixtures of butanes and pentanes were selected because these four hydrocarbons are the most prevalent components of gasoline vapors encountered under typical occupational exposures. The 0-145 \u00b0F gasoline distillation fraction was tested because it reasonably approximates the composition of gasoline vapors measured under occupational settinqs. Male and female F-344 rats were exposed to 2 levels of each mixture, 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 13 weeks. The target concentrations for the butane:pentane mixtures were 4500 and 1000 ppm, while 5200 and 1200 ppm were set for the gasoline distillation fraction. An interim sacrifice was conducted after 28 days. The rats were not significantly affected by the exposures, and there was no evidence of hydrocarbon-induced nephropathy in either sex at the termination of each study. However, at the 28-day interim sacrifice period for both butane:pentane mixtures, mild ... kidney effects were observed in the male rats. These perturbations were absent at the interim sacrifice period for the gasoline distillation fraction."
