            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of 2-dimethylaminoethanol can be estimated to be 1(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2-dimethylaminoethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of 2-dimethylaminoethanol is 9.3(3). At pH 8.2, 20% will be the free amine. Thus, this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(4). As a result, 2-dimethylaminoethanol may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates."
