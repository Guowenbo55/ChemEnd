More notably, the research demonstrates tebuconazole degradation occurs endogenously within plant tissues. Through metabolic reactions, the plant works to break down tebuconazole residues inside both roots and aerial portions. Most importantly, this breakdown shows enantioselective tendencies, proceeding at different rates for each tebuconazole enantiomer. This ability of wetland plants like Phragmites to actively uptake, translocate and metabolize applied pesticides like tebuconazole through intrinsic biochemical processes has important implications.

The results showed that all three pesticides could be taken up by rice roots, with varying distribution patterns in plant tissues. Epoxiconazole exhibited the highest accumulation in rice roots, followed by tebuconazole and then triadimefon, while the reverse order was observed in rice shoots. The movement of these pesticides within rice tissues involved both symplast and apoplast pathways, with different preferences for each pesticide. Subcellular distribution analysis revealed that all three pesticides had a higher proportion in cell walls compared to cell organelles and soluble components. Epoxiconazole had the highest accumulation in cell walls, while triadimefon was more concentrated in soluble components. The study concluded that the uptake, movement, and subcellular distribution of these pesticides are influenced by their hydrophobicity, highlighting the complex interactions between pesticides and plant tissues.",

In greenhouse experiments, minimal translocation of the fungicides (<1%) was observed from flag leaves to ears and a maximum of 3.55% from ears to flag leaves. Field experiments showed that degradation kinetics were faster in flag leaf blades than in ears, with varying rates depending on cultivar. Despite differences in degradation rates, both fungicides resulted in significant decreases (42.6\u2013100%) in FHB traits. The findings suggest that while there is limited translocation of these fungicides, moderate redistribution in the ears occurs, which can be crucial for FHB management. Cultivar and environmental factors also influenced degradation kinetics, but overall, effective protection against FHB was maintained.",
