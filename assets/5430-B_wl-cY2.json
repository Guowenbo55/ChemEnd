    "Description": "Thiabendazole is a member of the class of benzimidazoles carrying a 1,3-thiazol-4-yl substituent at position 2. A mainly post-harvest fungicide used to control a wide range of diseases including Aspergillus, Botrytis, Cladosporium and Fusarium. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical and an antinematodal drug. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a member of 1,3-thiazoles and a benzimidazole fungicide. It derives from a hydride of a 1H-benzimidazole.",

This interferes with the uptake of nutrients and the worms effectively starve to death. The host is less affected as the binding to mammalian tubulin is less strong and is reversible."

Chemical analysis of pepper plants showed that the fungicides accumulated in the leaves only, where concentrations of 20 ppm TBZ and 60 ppm MBC were recorded. Thiabendazole was completely removed from pepper plants by acetone extraction, whereas MBC was only partially removed by acetone and the rest was weakly bound to the tissue and released by either methanolic HCl extraction or acid hydrolysis. The rate of disappearance of TBZ from pepper leaves was three to four times faster than that of MBC. Balance studies in tomatoes have shown an average disappearance rate of 13.5% per 10 days for MBC. 2-Aminobenzimidazole, the degradation product of MBC, was always detected but its concentration did not exceed 2% of that of the parent compound.",
