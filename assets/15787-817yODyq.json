            "Value": "Nitrofen degraded slowly under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with a sewage inoculum, but only in the presence of an external source of carbon and energy; after 88 days of incubation 6% and 4% degradation occurred under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively(1). Four unspecified products were formed in the aerobic experiment, all more hydrophilic than the parent compound(1). The corresponding amine was identified as a biodegradation product of nitrofen(2). Nitrofen, present at 100 mg/L, reached 2% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(3). Nitrofen was degraded slowly by soil microorganisms during the first week and persisted more than 4 weeks when it was the sole source of carbon(4). When other sources of carbon were added, degradation occurred in 3 weeks(4). After 16 weeks of incubation in laboratory experiments, 15 and 38% of the initial concentration (10 ppm) of nitrofen remained in sandy loam (0.7% organic matter, pH 7.0) and muck (36.7% organic matter, pH 7.0) soils, respectively, 94% and 82% nitrofen remained in the same soils that were sterilized(5). Nitrofen slowly but completely biodegraded to carbon dioxide in typical soils likely proceeding through diphenyl ether cleavage(6). In a river die-away test using Asahi River (Japan) water, 1% of the nitrofen remained after 50 days incubation at 20 \u00b0C(7)."

Heart fibroblasts were isolated and treated with varying doses of nitrofen in vitro. Experiments were performed to determine the effects of this herbicide on important cellular processes including migration, proliferation and apoptosis. These studies illustrated a dose-dependent decrease in collagen gel contraction and proliferation in response to nitrofen. Assays were also performed to determine the effects of nitrofen on fibroblast gene expression. Increased expression of collagen type I and specific integrins were seen following nitrofen exposure. These studies illustrate that nitrofen has direct effects on cardiac fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular events important in valvuloseptal development."

The results showed that cell morphologic damages were observed after exposure to 1.0 mmol/L and 10.0 mmol/L nitrofen. LDH release increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Depressions in 3H-TdR and 3H-Leu incorporation were found even at 0.01 mmol/L, and increased with the exposure dose. Cell cycle was analyzed from the DNA- histogram with propidium iodide stain. The results showed that there was no pronounced alteration in cell cycle after cells exposed to 0.01 and 0.1 mmol/L nitrofen. At dose of 1.0 mmol/L, S phase cells increased 2 times of that of control. With the increase of dose, G2/M phase cells became to increase about 5 times of that of the control. At 1.0 mmol/L, time course of cell cycle after exposure was observed. At the beginning of exposure, cells in S phase and G2/M phase were about 8.7% and 11%. Following 24 hr incubation with nitrofen, cells in S phase increased to 18.0% with almost no change in G2/M. 72 hr after exposure, G2/M phase cells increased to 63.3%. The above results demonstrated that S phase and G2/M phase blockage in cultured keratinocytes after exposed to nitrofen seems of importance in the mechanism of nitrofen-induced toxicity."

            "Value": "... Nitrofen induces a time-dependent cell death of P19 cells that is associated with increases in TUNEL-positivity and caspase-3 cleavage suggesting that nitrofen induces P19 cell apoptosis. In addition, the increase in TUNEL-positive cells was inhibited with zVAD-fmk, suggesting that nitrofen induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis. Nitrofen treatment was associated with increased p38 MAP kinase activity, though pretreatment of cells with multiple p38 inhibitors did not affect nitrofen-mediated caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting caspase-3 cleavage is p38-independent. Nitrofen induced a dose-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione, indicating that nitrofen alters the cellular redox state of these cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine gave a dose- and time-dependent reduction of caspase-3 cleavage, supporting the observations that caspase-3 cleavage is cell-redox-dependent. Therefore, nitrofen induces P19 cell apoptosis that is cell-redox-dependent and is associated with increases in p38 activity and ROS and may play a role in nitrofen-mediated birth defects."

            "Value": "The study on nitrofen's translocation reveals that when applied to either the root or shoot zone, its effectiveness significantly affects plant growth, particularly in reducing shoot growth. However, it's observed that when nitrofen is applied to the shoot zone, it causes more injury to the plants than root exposure. The research demonstrates that the movement of nitrofen from root applications to the tops of various plant species, such as pea and sorghum, is minimal. This lack of translocation from the roots to the shoots elucidates why the herbicide's activity is limited when applied to the root zone. Furthermore, the study indicates that nitrofen and oxyfluorfen, another herbicide, showed limited movement from the point of application on leaves, with minimal translocation observed, mainly toward the leaf tip. This limited translocation from both root and foliage applications underscores the importance of movement within the plant for herbicidal activity, especially for compounds like nitrofen, which require light activation in the shoot region to exhibit their herbicidal effects."
