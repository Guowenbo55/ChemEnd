In earlier studies, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to iron overload, oxidative stress and activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, which could regulate various genes leading to a tumorigenic response in the spleen. However, molecular mechanisms leading to aniline-induced cellular proliferation in the spleen remain largely unknown. This study was, therefore, undertaken on the regulation of G1 phase cell cycle proteins (cyclins), expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and cell proliferation in the spleen, in an experimental condition preceding a tumorigenic response. Male SD rats were treated with aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water) for 30 days (controls received drinking water only), and splenocyte proliferation, protein expression of G1 phase cyclins, CDKs and pRB were measured. Aniline treatment resulted in significant increases in splenocyte proliferation, based on cell counts, cell proliferation markers including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nuclear Ki67 protein (Ki67) and minichromosome maintenance (MCM), MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Western blot analysis of splenocyte proteins from aniline-treated rats showed significantly increased expression of cyclins D1, D2, D3 and E, as compared to the controls. Similarly, real-time PCR analysis showed significantly increased mRNA expression for cyclins D1, D2, D3 and E in the spleens of aniline-treated rats. The overexpression of these cyclins was associated with increases in the expression of CDK4, CDK6, CDK2 as well as phosphorylation of pRB protein. Our data suggest that increased expression of cyclins, CDKs and phosphorylation of pRB protein could be critical in cell proliferation, and may contribute to aniline-induced tumorigenic response in the spleen."

            "Value": "Mechanisms by which aniline exposure elicits splenotoxicity, especially a tumorigenic response, are not well-understood. Earlier, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to oxidative DNA damage and up-regulation of OGG1 and NEIL1/2 DNA glycosylases in rat spleen. However, the contribution of endonuclease III homolog 1 (NTH1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in the repair of aniline-induced oxidative DNA damage in the spleen is not known. This study was, therefore, focused on examining whether NTH1 and APE1 contribute to the repair of oxidative DNA lesions in the spleen, in an experimental condition preceding tumorigenesis. To achieve this, male SD rats were subchronically exposed to aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water for 30 days), while controls received drinking water only. By quantitating the cleavage products, the activities of NTH1 and APE1 were assayed using substrates containing thymine glycol (Tg) and tetrahydrofuran, respectively. Aniline treatment led to significant increases in NTH1- and APE1-mediated BER activity in the nuclear extracts of spleen of aniline-treated rats compared to the controls. NTH1 and APE1 mRNA expression in the spleen showed 2.9- and 3.2-fold increases, respectively, in aniline-treated rats compared to the controls. Likewise, Western blot analysis showed that protein expression of NTH1 and APE1 in the nuclear extracts of spleen from aniline-treated rats was 1.9- and 2.7-fold higher than the controls, respectively. Immunohistochemistry indicated that aniline treatment also led to stronger immunoreactivity for both NTH1 and APE1 in the spleens, confined to the red pulp areas. These results, thus, show that aniline exposure is associated with induction of NTH1 and APE1 in the spleen. The increased repair activity of NTH1 and APE1 could be an important mechanism for the removal of oxidative DNA lesions. These findings thus identify a novel mechanism through which NTH1 and APE1 may regulate the repair of oxidative DNA damage in aniline-induced splenic toxicity."

Earlier, we have shown that aniline-induced oxidative stress is associated with increased oxidative DNA damage in rat spleen. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the major mechanism for the repair of oxidative DNA base lesions, and we have shown an up-regulation of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1), a specific DNA glycosylase involved in the removal of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) adducts, following aniline exposure. Nei-like DNA glycosylases (NEIL1/2) belong to a family of BER proteins that are distinct from other DNA glycosylases, including OGG1. However, contribution of NEIL1/2 in the repair of aniline-induced oxidative DNA damage in the spleen is not known. This study was, therefore, focused on evaluating if NEILs also contribute to the repair of oxidative DNA lesions in the spleen following aniline exposure. To achieve that, male SD rats were subchronically exposed to aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water for 30 days), while controls received drinking water only. The BER activity of NEIL1/2 was assayed using a bubble structure substrate containing 5-OHU (preferred substrates for NEIL1 and NEIL2) and by quantitating the cleavage products. Aniline treatment led to a 1.25-fold increase in the NEIL1/2-associated BER activity in the nuclear extracts of spleen compared to the controls. Real-time PCR analysis for NEIL1 and NEIL2 mRNA expression in the spleen revealed 2.7- and 3.9-fold increases, respectively, in aniline-treated rats compared to controls. Likewise, Western blot analysis showed that protein expression of NEIL1 and NEIL2 in the nuclear extract of spleens from aniline-treated rats was 2.0- and 3.8-fold higher than controls, respectively. Aniline treatment also led to stronger immunoreactivity for NEIL1 and NEIL2 in the spleens, confined to the red pulp areas. These studies, thus, show that aniline-induced oxidative stress is associated with an induction of NEIL1/2. The increased NIEL-mediated BER activity is another indication of aniline-induced oxidative damage in the spleen and could constitute another important mechanism of removal of oxidative DNA lesions, especially in transcribed DNA following aniline insult."

Previous studies have shown that aniline exposure leads to iron accumulation and oxidative stress in the spleen, which may cause activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors and regulate the transcription of genes involved in fibrosis and/or tumorigenesis. To test this, male SD rats were treated with 0.5 mmol/kg/day aniline via drinking water for 30 days, and activation of transcription factor AP-1 was determined in the splenocyte nuclear extracts (NEs). AP-1 DNA-binding activity in the NEs of freshly isolated splenocytes from aniline-treated rats increased in comparison to the controls, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). AP-1 binding was also determined in the NEs of cultured splenocytes (2 hr and 24 hr), which showed even a greater increase in binding activity at 2 hr. The specificity of AP-1 binding for relevant DNA motifs was confirmed by competition EMSA and by supershift EMSA using antibodies specific to c-Jun and c-Fos. To further explore the signaling mechanisms in the AP-1 activation, phosphorylation patterns of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were pursued. Aniline exposure induced increases in the phosphorylation of the three classes of MAPKs: extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK 1/2), and p38 MAPKs. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression showed a 3-fold increase in the spleens of aniline-treated rats. These observations suggest a strong association among MAPK phosphorylation, AP-1 activation, and enhanced TGF-beta1 gene expression. The observed sequence of events subsequent to aniline exposure could regulate genes that lead to fibrogenic and/or tumorigenic response in the spleen."

To test this hypothesis, male SD rats were treated with 0.5 mmol/kg/day aniline hydrochloride via drinking water for 30 days. Cytokine mRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative PCR, while cytokine release was determined in the supernatants of the cultured splenocytes using specific ELISAs. IL-1alpha, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA levels showed 6.9-, 2.9-, and 2.6-fold increases, respectively, in the spleens of aniline-treated rats in comparison to the controls. The increases in mRNA levels were associated with enhanced secretion of these cytokines in the splenocyte culture supernatants. NF-kappa B p65 level in the nuclear extracts of cultured splenocytes of aniline-treated rats showed a 2-fold increase in comparison to the controls as quantitated by NF-kappa B p65-specific ELISA. The binding activity of NF-kappa B, determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), also showed an increase in NF-kappa B binding in the nuclear extracts of the splenocytes from aniline-treated rats. The specificity of NF-kappa B binding was further confirmed by supershift assays. The results indicate that aniline exposure causes enhanced expression of IL-1alpha, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, both at mRNA and protein levels, suggesting their role in splenic fibrosis. Also, the increased NF-kappa B binding activity suggests that up-regulation of these cytokines in the spleen is a redox-dependent mechanism."

            "Value": "Studies in rats ... have indicated that erythrocytes preferentially bind aniline, and that at high doses (100 mg/kg), aniline selectively accumulates in the spleen due to scavenging of damaged erythrocytes. The deposition of debris from erythrocytes results in hemosiderosis, which in turn induces a fibrotic response in the spleen that may be involved in sarcoma production ... Aniline accumulation in the spleen /has been shown to be/ nonlinear; only minimal accumulation of aniline and no hemosiderosis is observed at doses below 10 mg/kg. Since hemosiderosis may be important in the induction of splenic sarcoma, the linearized multistage procedure may not be the most appropriate method for the derivation of the slope factor."

            "Value": "Aniline and several other aromatic amines produce spleen tumors in rats given high doses of compound in 2 year bioassay studies. Evaluation of the pathogenesis of the splenic lesion and characterization of the disposition of radiolabelled aniline in animals suggests that the spleen tumors may be a secondary response resulting from chemically mediated erythrocyte toxicity. It is proposed that compound derived toxicity to erythrocytes results in scavenging of damaged red blood cells by the spleen, initiating a series of events which may contribute to the development of spleen tumors. These events potentially include (1) specific accumulation of the parent compound or toxic metabolite(s) carried to the spleen by erythrocytes; (2) deposition of erythrocytic debris, particularly iron, which may catalyse tissue damaging free radical reactions; and (3) induction of splenic hyperplasia resulting from erythrocyte overload. Linkage of the splenic tumorigenicity of these aromatic amines to an initial toxic event in the erythrocyte suggest that the carcinogenicity of such compounds may be determined by a definable threshold dose, ie the events leading to the carcinogenicity are not initiated until the capacity of the red blood cell to cope with the toxic insult. ..."

            "Value": "Earlier studies with aniline suggested the involvement of oxidative stress as an early toxic event in the spleen. In order to understand the status and consequences of the damaging oxidative reactions, especially during the progression of characteristic splenic lesions, time-dependent subchronic studies were conducted in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 65 mg/kg/day aniline in the drinking water, while control rats received drinking water only. The animals were euthanized after 1, 2, or 3 months of aniline exposure. Total iron content was remarkably greater in the aniline-treated rats than in age-matched controls. There were time-dependent increases in splenic lipid peroxidation of aniline-treated rats. Malondialdehyde-protein adducts were quantitated by a competitive ELISA and showed greater concentrations in the spleens of aniline-treated rats, further substantiating our lipid peroxidation results. Protein oxidation in the spleens of aniline-treated rats was also greater, with a maximum increase of approximately 76% at 3 months. Western blot analysis for oxidized proteins showed two distinct protein bands at approximately 114 kD and approximately 69 kD in both post-nuclear and mitochondrial fractions of the spleens. Furthermore, densitometric analysis of the blot showed increased band intensities of the oxidized proteins in both these spleen fractions from aniline-treated rats, suggesting the susceptibility of these proteins to aniline-induced oxidative stress. The most prominent morphological changes in the spleens of aniline-treated rats included thickening of the capsule, and capsular cells with nuclear prominence and hyperchromia indicative of capsular hyperplasia. These capsular changes and fibrosis of capsule, splenic trabeculae, and red pulp were noted at all three time points after aniline exposure. /Those/ studies thus suggest that aniline-induced oxidative stress in the spleen is an ongoing event that leads to oxidative modifications of biomolecules. Such oxidative modifications, directly or indirectly, could contribute to the splenic toxicity leading to deleterious consequences, including capsular hyperplasia and fibrosis, as observed in this study, and possibly tumorigenesis in chronic aniline exposure conditions."

Aniline exposure also leads to toxic response in spleen which is characterized by splenomegaly, hyperplasia, fibrosis and the eventual formation of tumors on chronic in vivo exposure. Previously, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to iron overload, oxidative DNA damage, and increased cell proliferation, which could eventually contribute to a tumorigenic response in the spleen. Despite our demonstration that cell proliferation was associated with deregulation of G1 phase cyclins and increased expression of G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), molecular mechanisms, especially the regulation of G2 phase and contribution of epigenetic mechanisms in aniline-induced splenic cellular proliferation remain largely unclear. This study therefore, mainly focused on the regulation of G2 phase in an animal model preceding a tumorigenic response. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day) in drinking water or drinking water only (controls) for 30 days, and expression of G2 phase cyclins, CDK1, CDK inhibitors and miRNAs were measured in the spleen. Aniline treatment resulted in significant increases in cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclins A, B and CDK1, particularly phosphor-CDK1, and decreases in CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, which could promote the splenocytes to go through G2/M transition. Our data also showed upregulation of tumor markers Trx-1 and Ref-1 in rats treated with aniline. More importantly, we observed lower expression of miRNAs including Let-7a, miR-15b, miR24, miR-100 and miR-125, and greater expression of CDK inhibitor regulatory miRNAs such as miR-181a, miR-221 and miR-222 in the spleens of aniline-treated animals. Our findings suggest that significant increases in the expression of cyclins, CDK1 and aberrant regulation of miRNAs could lead to an accelerated G2/M transition of the splenocytes, and potentially to a tumorigenic response on chronic aniline exposure."

The Hb adduct levels increased proportionately with dose after 1 week, which indicates that metabolic activation was not saturated. After 4 weeks of feeding, the adduct levels increased less than proportionately, which suggests that a saturation process is involved. Since it is unlikely that metabolic activation was saturated, the results could be explained by a more rapid clearance of stressed erythrocytes at the carcinogenic dose level. The latter interpretation is supported by other observations which indicate that erythrocytes are damaged dose dependently. A no-observed-effect level (NOEL) has not been reached but could be close to the low dose of 10 mg/kg body weight per day. The Hb adduct formation at the low dose, however, indicates that this should not be considered a no-effect level (NEL).

Exposure to aniline occurs via air, diet, and water augmenting the risk of exposing a large number of individuals. Early observations suggest that aniline is metabolized to paracetamol/acetaminophen, likely explaining the omnipresence of low concentrations of paracetamol in European populations. This is of concern as recent studies implicate paracetamol as a disrupter of reproduction. Here, we show through steroidogenic profiling that exposure to aniline led to increased levels of the delta-4 steroids, suggesting that the activity of CYP21 was decreased. By contrast, paracetamol decreased levels of androgens likely through inhibition of CYP17A1 activity. We confirm that /in mice,/ aniline in vivo is rapidly converted to paracetamol by the liver. Intrauterine exposure to aniline and paracetamol in environmental and pharmaceutical relevant doses /(single dose of 0.5 mL drinking water (control), 31 mg/kg aniline, or 62 mg/kg aniline dileted in a total of 0.5 mL water by oral gavage)/ resulted in shortening of the anogenital distance in mice, a sensitive marker of fetal androgen levels that in humans is associated with reproductive malformations and later life reproductive disorders. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a scenario where aniline, through its conversion into antiandrogenic paracetamol, impairs male reproductive development."

No treatment-related alterations were observed in the reproductive parameters examined (including number of corpora lutea, implantations, resorptions, or dead fetuses). In the fetuses of the 100 mg/kg group, the relative liver weight and erythrocyte size were significantly elevated over control values. The methemoglobin levels in the fetuses were not significantly different from those of the controls. Aniline produced no other dose-related adverse effects in the fetuses and dams.

In the micronucleus test aniline (as aniline hydrochloride) was administered to groups of seven male PVG rats at single oral doses of 0, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg body weight. Bone marrow was obtained 24 and 48 hr after oral treatment. Smears of bone marrow were stained with acridine orange and erythrocytes were examined for the presence of micronuclei. Animals receiving cyclophosphamide (1x7.5 mg/kg) served as positive controls. Clinical signs observed in animals dosed at 300 mg/kg and above included cyanosis, light brown coloured urine and cold to touch. Small, but statistically significant and dose-related increases in the incidence of micronulei over the vehicle control values were observed at the 24-h sampling time only. Cyclophosphamide induced a significant and comparably much higher increase in micronuclei than aniline. In the bone marrow metaphase test aniline (as aniline hydrochloride) was administered to groups of seven male PVG rats at single oral dose levels of 0, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg body weight. Bone marrow was sampled 18 and 30 hr after dosing. A group treated with cyclophosphamide (1x40 mg/kg) served as positive control. A small increase in the percentage of aberrant cells above solvent control values was recorded in one rat at 400 mg/kg and four rats at 500 mg/kg at the 18-hr sampling time only. The positive control cyclophosphamide induced a much higher rate of aberrant cells in all animals. Several lines of evidences are presented against a causal relationship between the clastogenic activity in male PVG rats at 400 and 500 mg/kg and the carcinogenicity in the spleen of Fischer 344 rats starting at 30 mg/kg in males. Among these are the dose-response relationship of the tumor incidence, the close correlation between degree of spleen damage and tumor induction, the lack of carcinogenic effects in mice even at higher dose levels, or in rats at dose levels inducing only slight haematotoxicity and spleen toxicity, and the available data on the mode of action of other chemicals inducing spleen tumors. /Aniline hydrochloride/"

Splenotoxicity of aniline is associated with iron overload and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids (oxidative stress). 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is one of the most abundant oxidative DNA lesions resulting from ROS, and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1), a specific DNA glycosylase/lyase enzyme, plays a key role in the removal of 8-OHdG adducts. This study focused on examining DNA damage (8-OHdG) and repair (OGG1) in the spleen in an experimental condition preceding a tumorigenic response. To achieve that, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subchronically exposed to aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water for 30 days), while controls received drinking water only. Aniline treatment led to a significant increase in splenic oxidative DNA damage, manifested as a 2.8-fold increase in 8-OHdG levels. DNA repair activity, measured as OGG1 base excision repair (BER) activity, increased by approximately 1.3 fold in the nuclear protein extracts (NE) and approximately 1.2 fold in the mitochondrial protein extracts (ME) of spleens from aniline-treated rats as compared to the controls. Real-time PCR analysis for OGG1 mRNA expression in the spleen revealed a 2-fold increase in expression in aniline-treated rats than the controls. Likewise, OGG1 protein expression in the NEs of spleens from aniline-treated rats was approximately 1.5 fold higher, whereas in the MEs it was approximately 1.3 fold higher than the controls. Aniline treatment also led to stronger immunostaining for both 8-OHdG and OGG1 in the spleens, confined to the red pulp areas.

However, nitrated proteins remain to be characterized. Therefore, in the current study using proteomic approaches, we focused on characterizing the nitrated proteins in the spleen of aniline-exposed rats. Aniline exposure led to increased tyrosine nitration of proteins, as determined by 2D Western blotting with anti-3-nitrotyrosine specific antibody, compared to the controls. The analyzed nitrated proteins were found in the molecular weight range of 27.7 to 123.6 kDa. A total of 37 nitrated proteins were identified in aniline-treated and control spleens. Among them, 25 were found only in aniline-treated rats, 11 were present in both aniline-treated and control rats, while one was found in controls only. The nitrated proteins identified mainly represent skeletal proteins, chaperones, ferric iron transporter, enzymes, nucleic acids binding protein, and signaling and protein synthesis pathways. Furthermore, aniline exposure led to significantly increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression in the spleen, suggesting its role in increased reactive nitrogen species formation and contribution to increased nitrated proteins.

            "Value": "The Koc of aniline in 2 silt loams was measured as 130 and 410 with the higher value occurring in the more acidic soil(1). The Koc of aniline in colloidal organic carbon from groundwater (pH 6.5) was reported as 3,870(2). The adsorption constant for adsorption to H-montmorillonite (pH 8.35) and Na-montmorillonite (pH 6.8) is 1,300 and 130(3). The Koc of aniline in 3 silt-clay loams were 269 (pH 4.4), 48 (pH 6.5) and 16 (pH 7.2)(4). A mean Koc value of 55 was determined for aniline in 4 sewage sludge samples(5). The Koc in five second-generation reference EUROSOILS was 8, 32, 19, 27 and 137(6). In a sorption study using pond sediment from Cherokee Park pond in Athens GA, the sorption kinetics of aniline were characterized by a rapid initial loss of aniline from the aqueous phase followed by a much slower rate of disappearance; the initial sorption was a reversible cation-exchange followed by a slower covalent-binding. It was shown that at pH values greater than the pKa, sorption kinetics were slower than at pH 3.75 (rate constants of 4.53-7.95/hr above versus 13.3 below)(7). The sorption of aniline in a silty clay soil after 24 hours was not solely dependent on cation exchange, solubility was a consideration, and passing rainwater through a soil column had no effect on the sorption to the silty clay soil(8). Using four Indiana soils and one Iowa soil, abiotic loss of aniline from the aqueous phase to the soil phase occurred with an initial rapid loss due to reversible mass transfer processes followed by a slow loss due to irreversible reactions(9)."
