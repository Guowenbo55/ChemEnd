Halosulfuron applied 1 day before cyhalofop or applied in a tank mixture reduced broadleaf signalgrass and propanil-resistant or propanil-susceptible barnyardgrass by 35 to 59 percentage points. Triclopyr applied 5, 3, or 1 day before, or mixed with, cyhalofop reduced control of propanil-resistant and propanil-susceptible barnyardgrass by 16 to 41 percentage points, respectively. Triclopyr applied 1 day before cyhalofop or combined with cyhalofop reduced broadleaf signalgrass control by 38 and 18 percentage points, respectively, compared with cyhalofop alone. Propanil reduced cyhalofop grass control only when mixed with cyhalofop.b Application timings, averaged across halosulfuron, propanil, and triclopyr, made 1 day before cyhalofop or tank-mixed with cyhalofop, reduced grass control more compared with other application timings made before or after cyhalofop. Barnyardgrass absorption of 14C-cyhalofop alone or mixed with propanil was 86% and 75%, respectively, with 14C-cyhalofop translocation being reduced by 10-fold when propanil was mixed with cyhalofop. Reductions in cyhalofop translocation in combination with propanil may have partially explained the reductions in grass control observed in the field.",
