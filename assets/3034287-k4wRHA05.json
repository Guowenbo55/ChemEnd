It has a role as a neonicotinoid insectide. It is a C-nitro compound and a monochloropyridine. It is functionally related to a 2-chloropyridine.",

The second leaf of the cucumber was sprayed with the chemical solution of the practical concentration, with the other parts of the plant covered with a polyethylene bag to keep them free from chemical deposits. The adult females of the apterous vivipara were placed onto the untreated first and third leaves on the day of treatment, and 1 weekafter and 2 weeks after treatment. The numbers of aphids were counted 5 days after the inoculation. Nitenpyram highly suppressedthe aphid densities, not only on the first leaf, but on the third leaf for 2 weeks after treatment (Table 13).  The excellent insecticidal activity by translaminar action and translocation was the outstanding characteristic of nitenpyram, and its good systemicity will minimize the adverse effect of biased deposit distribution of the sprayed chemical solution.
