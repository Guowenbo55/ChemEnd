During initial anesthetic administration, the blood pressure increase by 30-40 mmHg with some animals exhibiting an increase of 80-100 mmHg. The authors concluded that this increase was caused by a stimulation of the vasomotor center with a concurrent displacement of blood from the splanchnic to the peripheral vessels. An observed slowing of the pulse rate was judged not to be related to the blood pressure increase but to a stimulation of the vagal center by acetylene. An increase in the amplitude of the pulse was also noted to be a consequence of this direct action on the heart."
