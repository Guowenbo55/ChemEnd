The goal of the current study was to better understand the mechanism of glycol ether testicular toxicity through gene expression profiling and functional classification of differentially expressed genes. Male rats were administered 2-ME (150 and 50mg/kg/day), 2-EE (500 mg/kg/day), 2-BE (125 mg/kg/day), or vehicle for 3 days, and testes were collected for histopathological and gene expression analysis. Histopathological changes in the testes were observed only in animals given 150 mg/kg/day 2-ME, consisting of degeneration and necrosis of spermatocytes and reductions in spermatocyte numbers. Microarray analysis of testicular samples from these animals revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes from animals exposed to 2-EE or to 50mg/kg or 150 mg/kg 2-ME (>900 each at >1.5-fold changed), compared to 28 genes from 2-BE treated animals. Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) analysis of these genes demonstrated statistical enrichment in genes in categories including protein transport, endocytosis, protein kinase activity, cell cycle, and meiosis. Quantitative PCR confirmation of select genes confirmed increased expression of the actin binding protein cortactin and the transcription factor Wilm's tumor 1 (Wt1) following 2-ME exposure. Increased localization of cortactin in abnormal spermatocytes was also observed by immunohistochemistry, consistent with a possible role for this protein in the mechanism of toxicity."

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of male reproductive toxicants on protein expression profiles in the rat testes and to identify potential biomarker candidates. Four well-known reproductive toxicants, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), cyclophosphamide (CP), sulfasalazine (SASP) and 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), were administered to male rats in a single dose, and protein expression profiles were investigated after 24 hr by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Histopathological examination of the testes and serum concentration analysis were also performed. From the results of the comparison of 2D-gels among different doses of a compound and among compounds, 52, 20, 24 and 111 spots were nominated as differentially expressed spots with EGME, CP, SASP and 2,5-HD treatments, respectively. Several spermatogenesis-involved proteins were identified, including glutathione S-transferase (GST), testis-specific heat shock protein 70-2 (HSP70-2), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP). Some of them were altered by more than one compound. In summary, remarkable histopathological findings were observed only in the EGME high-dose group, and most of the protein changes were detected before histopathological changes occurred. Therefore, the proteins identified in this study could potentially serve as biomarkers to evaluate male reproductive toxicity at an early stage of drug discovery and development."

Subsequently, red blood cells (RBC), packed cell volumes (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) decreased. Furthermore, an increase in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) and reticulocyte counts was observed. The onset of hemolysis induced by EE, IPE or BE was faster than after ME administration. While in rats exposed to ME hematological changes were strongly pronounced and progressively increased with exposure time beginning from the day 11, those in animals treated with EE were rather persistent at low constant level for all exposure period. In contrast, the rats exposed to IPE and BE demonstrated the dramatic hematological changes more pronounced in case of BE than IPE at the beginning of exposure (on day 4). /SRP: Despite continued exposures these changes regressed/ although the decrease in RBC and MCHC and the increase in MCV and MCH in rats treated with highest doses of both compound (0.5, 0.75, and 1.25 mM/kg) were more persistent, probably due to selective hemolysis of the aged erythrocytes.

Preliminary studies have been made of the effect of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether on hamsters and guinea pig testes. Decreased testicular weight had been found in hamsters receiving doses from 62.5 to 500 mg/kg and in guinea pigs receiving 500 or 250 mg/kg. The methyl ethers of propylene and diethylene glycol do not have the same effect. Both ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether have been seen demonstrated to have embryotoxic effects. Both methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol cause testicular atrophy. Esterification of these chemicals does not affect potency of the toxicity. Dimethyl and monomethyl ethers have about the same testicular toxicity. Alkyl ethers of other glycols are without these effects in the testes. Ethylene glycol alkyl ethers appear to affect dividing cells and inhibit cell proliferation. Changes induced by these agents can be distinguished from those induced by hormonal substances by their lack of effect on Leydig and Sertoli cells. Some ethylene glycol alkyl ethers have toxic effects on both testes and fetus. Substances known to inhibit cell proliferation are expected to damage the fetus if given to pregnant animals."

In rabbits, exposure to 100-300 ppm resulted in maternal toxicity: decreased weight gain at 100-300 ppm, clinical signs at 200-300 ppm, alterations in hematology at 100-300 ppm, reduced gravid uterine weight at termination at 200-300 ppm, and elevated absolute liver weight at 300 ppm. Developmental toxicity was observed at 100-300 ppm: an increased incidence of totally resorbed litters at 200-300 ppm, an increase in nonviable fetuses at 300 ppm, and a decrease in viable implants (live fetuses) per litter at 200-300 ppm.

At the end of each treatment period, the males were sacrificed and preparations of caudal epididymal sperm were used for the assessment of sperm motility and count using the Hamilton-Thorne sperm analyzer (HTM-IVOS). Sperm motility parameters included path velocity (VAP), straight line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), beat cross frequency (BCF), straightness (STR), linearity (LIN), % of motile sperm and % progressively motile sperm (VAP >70 microns/sec, STR >50%).

High levels of sperm production and existence of large epididymal sperm reserves in most test species may impede the detection of spermatotoxicity at low doses.

The detection of spermatotoxicity in this animal relative to its nonmated counterpart was then compared following exposure to ethoxyethanol (EE). Adult, male Long-Evans hooded rats were assigned to a \"mate\" or \"nonmate\" condition, with the former mated every other day (3-hr sessions) for 2 weeks prior to and then throughout the experiment. After 2 weeks, males from each group were randomly assigned to receive either 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg (po) of EE, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Males were then sacrificed and organ weights, testicular spermatid counts, and cauda epididymal sperm count and sperm morphology were obtained. EE produced a significant reduction in testicular weight and spermatid counts in mated and nonmated animals receiving 300 mg/kg. Significant decreases were also noted in epididymal sperm count and percentage normal morphology. However, these effects were seen in the nonmated animals only at 300 mg/kg, whereas significant reductions in both parameters were also obtained at 150 mg/kg in the males mated bidaily.

The bw gain of the EGEE-treated rats decreased significantly at 200 and 400 mg/kg bw compared with the control group. There were no significant changes in the weights of the testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles and prostate glands of the EGEE-treated rats. In the testes, while EGEE treatment resulted in significant decrease in glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, it markedly increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities at 200 and 400 mg/kg dose levels but vitamin C content remained unaffected in all the groups. In the spermatozoa, administration of EGEE caused significant decrease in the activities of CAT, GST and LDH as well as in the levels of vitamin C and GSH but significantly increased the MDA level and SOD activity compared with the control rats. Histopathological examination showed severe degeneration of the testes, such as generalized erosion and necrosis of the germinal epithelium of the testes, but mildly affected the epididymis at 400 mg/kg dose only. Data on spermatozoa analysis of EGEE-treated rats revealed significant decrease in the epididymal spermatozoa number, testicular spermatozoa number, daily spermatozoa production and spermatozoa motility but significantly increased the total spermatozoa abnormalities without affecting the spermatozoa live-dead ratio at all dose levels when compared with the control group. Results of hematological examination showed that white blood cells (WBC), platelets, neutrophils and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly lower whereas lymphocytes were increased in 200 and 400 mg/kg EGEE-exposed rats than in the controls. EGEE at 100 mg/kg bw produced minor effect on hematological parameters but adversely affected testes and spermatozoa. In summary, short term administration of EGEE is hematotoxic and gonadotoxic and its effects on male reproduction could be due to the induction of oxidative stress in testes and spermatozoa."

Addition of EGEE to the medium of sperm had no effect on its motion, but the metabolite ethoxyacetic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect.

However, motion of sperm from the spermaduct, as analyzed with a Hamilton-Thorne Sperm analyzer, was slightly decreased in the low dose group, and significantly lower in the high dose group; and the percentage of progressive sperm was also reduced in the two EGEE groups. This effect of EGEE treatment was observed in the wild-type, but not in the Aldh2 knockout mice. Sperm motion from the cauda epididymides was not affected. On the other hand, the concentration of ethoxyacetic acid, a metabolite of EGEE, in 24 hr pooled urine of EGEE-treated Aldh2 knockout mice was not significantly lower than that of the wild-type mice on most days of urine sampling.
