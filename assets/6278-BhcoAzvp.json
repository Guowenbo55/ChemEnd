            "Value": "AEROBIC: No degradation was observed in subsurface soils in 27 weeks of incubation; however, in loamy sand, slow degradation was observed under acclimated conditions(1,2). Slow degradation may occur in water under anaerobic or aerated conditions; degradation may take several weeks and acclimation is important(3,4). In seawater, a half-life of 9 months has been determined and vinylidene chloride is the degradation product(5). No degradation in river water was found(6). No utilization of 1,1,1-trichloroethane occurred in a continuously-fed aerobic biofilm reactor that utilized acetate as its primary substrate; however, 98% removal was obtained in a similar anaerobic reactor with a 2-day retention time after 8 wk acclimation(8). 1,1,1-Trichloroethane degraded to vinylidene chloride as a first step in its biotransformation in microcosms containing aquifer water and sediment collected from uncontaminated sites in the Everglades(7); considerable degradation occurred within two weeks(7). Field evidence of biodegradation in aquifers was obtained by following the concentration of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in a confined aquifer after it was injected with reclaimed groundwater(8); the half-life of 1,1,1-trichloroethane was 231 days with biodegradation given as the probable cause of loss(8). The biodegradation half-life of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in non-adapted aerobic soils from Louisiana and Oklahoma were reported as >97 days and >485 days, respectively(9). 1,1,1-Trichloroethane at 100 mg/L achieved 0% of its theoretical BOD using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L over a 2 week incubation period in the Japanese MITI test(10)."

Laboratory reactors using mixed acclimated anaerobic microbial populations have demonstrated that 1,1,1-trichloroethane can be biodegraded under anaerobic simulations(4,5,6); it was suggested that in-situ anaerobic biodegrdation may be a viable alternative for clean-up for various contaminated soil and groundwater sites(5). 1,1,1-Trichloroethane biodegraded in anoxic biofilm columns with an effluent removal that exceeded 99% (at 10 ppb influent) after 9-12 wks of acclimation(7). The half-life of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in an unpolluted anaerobic aquifer was estimated as 9 days (1% organic carbon content), 32 days (0.1% organic carbon content), 346 days (0.01% organic carbon content) and 16 years (0.001% organic carbon content)(8). Anoxic laboratory experiments simulating conditions in water unsaturated topsoil observed that degradation of 1,1,1-trichloroethane was similar in biologically active batches as compared to sterile batches(9). An anaerobic microcosm study using mixed microbial cultures obtained from a contaminated groundwater site in the northeastern US found that 1,1,1-trichloroethane was reductively dechlorinated to 1,1-dichloroethane and then to monochloroethane(10)."

In general, the highly lipophilic nature of chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane, allows them to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and partition into lipids in neuronal membranes. This property allows them to interfere with neural membrane function, bringing about central nervous system depression, behavioral changes, and anesthesia."

Pretreatment with inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide and actinomycin-D) were used to block the effect of methyl chloroform on the hepatic drug-metabolizing system. Inhalation of methyl chloroform (2500-3000 ppm) for 24 hours decreased the duration of action of hexobarbital, meprobamate, and zoxazolamine. This was accompanied by an increase in the metabolism of hexobarbital, zoxazolamine and aminopyrine in vitro by hepatic microsomal enzymes. Cytochrome p450 and cytochrome c reductase were also increased; however, liver weight and liver microsomal protein were not enhanced. Pretreatment of rats with protein synthesis inhibitors prevented methyl chloroform induced decrease in hexobarbital sleeping time and the increase in hepatic drug metabolism."

With the knowledge of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TRI) uptake and distribution in the various brain regions, cyclic GMP was evaluated due to (1) known susceptibility to the effects of organic solvents, (2) pivotal physiological role in perpetuating changes in neurochemical pathways, and (3) possible involvement with neurobehavioral functions, whose disruption is one of the primary health effects associated with solvent exposures. Male CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats inhaled 5000 ppm 1,1,1-trichloroethane for 40 and 100 min in dynamic inhalation exposure chambers, and the brain was procured from the animals immediately following termination by microwave irradiation. After 40 min of 1,1,1-trichloroethane inhalation, significant decreases in cyclic GMP levels were found in the cerebellum of both species, 55% and 58%, respectively, relative to the controls. There was a further decrease in both species after 100 min of 1, 1-trichloroethane inhalation. Smaller decreases in cyclic GMP were seen in the cortex of both species at both time points of measurement.

Comparison of the results from this study with the regional brain distribution of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and its effects on behavioral performance seen in previous studies by this laboratory appeared to indicate that alterations in brain cyclic GMP levels are only involved with the neurobehavioral toxicity of TRI in an indirect fashion; consequently, behavioral effects and decreases in cyclic GMP do not appear to be directly related to regionally differential dispositions of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in rodent brain."

The lowest TRI concentrations studied (500-2000 ppm) had no statistically significant effect on activity, intermediate concentrations (4000-8000 ppm) increased activity immediately to levels that remained constant over time, and higher concentrations (10,000-14,000 ppm) produced biphasic effects, i.e., increases in activity followed by decreases. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane concentrations in blood and brain approached steady-state equilibria very rapidly, demonstrated linear kinetics, and increased in direct proportion to one another. Locomotor activity increased monophasically ( approximately 3.5-fold) as solvent concentrations increased from approximately 50-150 microg/g brain and microg/ml blood. As concentrations exceeded the upper limit of this range, the activity level declined and eventually fell below the control activity level at approximately 250 microg/g brain and microg/ml blood. Regression analyses indicated that blood and brain concentrations during exposure were strongly correlated with locomotor activity, as were measures of internal dose integrated over time.

Oxidative damage was assessed by measuring release of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances from lipid peroxidation loss of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) through damaged sarcolemmal membranes and alterations in intracellular calcium transients in electrically stimulated (1 Hz 10 ms 60 V) myocytes. Hydrogen peroxide increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances release and LDH leakage in a concentration-dependent (20-200 uM) manner. Continuous suffusion with hydrogen peroxide first altered the configuration of calcium transients then eliminated them and finally caused calcium overload (basal calcium) exceeded peak cytosolic calcium of controls.

The results showed that 1,1,2-trichloroethane caused definite pathologic changes of rat liver. It led to much higher values for GPT, SDH and GDH both in serum and perfusate than 1,1,1-trichloroethane did (P < 0.01). The concentration of perfusate K+ caused by 1,1,2-trichloroethane was higher than that by 1,1,1-trichloroethane (P < 0.01). The value of the relative total free radical concentration induced by 1,1,2-trichloroethane was also greater than that by 1,1,1-trichloroethane (P < 0.05). The results suggested that the hepatotoxicity of 1,1,2-trichloroethane was stronger than that of 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The free radical concentration was increased proportionally to the increase of the hepatotoxicity of 1,1,2-trichloroethane and 1,1,1-trichloroethane ..."

            "Value": "The adsorption of 1,1,1-trichloroethane was studied using three US soils(1); equilibrium adsorption coefficients (Kd) of 1.8, 1.592, and 1.338 were measured using a soil from Missouri (11.4% sand, 52.7% silt, 33.4% clay, 2.4% organic matter), California (45.1% sand, 35.2% silt, 21.7% clay, 1.7% organic matter) and Florida (9.17% sand, 6.3% silt, 2% clay, 1.6% organic matter), respectively(1); these adsorption coefficients correspond to Koc values of 120 (Missouri soil), 151 (California soil) and 135 (Florida soil). A Koc value of 66 was reported for 1,1,1-trichloroethane in an unspecified soil(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggests that 1,1,1-trichloroethane is expected to have high mobility in soil(SRC)."
