It showed a tendency of increasing concentration in stems and leaves corresponding to the treatment concentration. After 4 hours of continuous administration, metalaxyl was detected in roots, stems, and leaves, and the concentrations in these plant parts increased significantly within 72 hours. Initially, the concentrations in stems and leaves were lower than in roots, but after 48 hours, there was no significant difference in concentration among these plant parts. After 72 hours, the concentration in leaves was significantly higher than in stems and roots. The enrichment sites of metalaxyl differed from those of LH-2010A. For LH-2010A, the concentrations in stems and leaves were still significantly lower than in roots, and the concentration in stems became higher than in leaves after 48 hours. However, for metalaxyl, the concentrations in stems and leaves were significantly lower than in roots within the first 24 hours, and after 48 hours, there was no significant difference in concentration among stems, leaves, and roots. Additionally, the concentration of metalaxyl in stems became lower than in leaves after 48 hours.",

This study aimed to determine the translocation pattern of three fungicides with different modes of action applied as seed treatments and the effect of soil type on translocation. Results showed that most of the absorbed radioactivity was concentrated in the cotyledons, with the maximum sum of absorption rates by roots, stems, and leaves of the plants being 15%. Absorption by roots, stems, and leaves was generally lower than 5% for 14C-pyraclostrobin and 14C-metalaxyl, and 1.6% for 14C-carbendazim. Fungicide absorption by roots and whole seedlings was higher in soil with lower organic matter content. Fungicides absorbed by cotyledons are unlikely to be redistributed and are lost when cotyledons fall off. These findings enhance our understanding of seed treatment fungicide movement in soybean seedlings and may aid in developing seed treatment strategies for managing seed and soilborne pathogens.",
