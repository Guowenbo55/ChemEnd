In the 1990s, B6C3F1 mice from some chronic National Toxicology Program (NTP) studies were found to be infected with H. hepaticus. In these studies, there was hepatitis in many of the males, and there were more hepatocellular neoplasms in control males compared to studies with uninfected mice. In one of these studies, increased hepatocellular neoplasms at the high doses in male and female mice exposed topically to triethanolamine (TEA) provided the only evidence of carcinogenic activity. This study was repeated in mice free of H. hepaticus. However, the NTP mouse production colony and the diet differed between studies; these differences were the result of NTP programmatic decisions. In repeat study males, although control incidences were similar between studies, exposure did not result in increased hepatocellular neoplasms. In repeat study females, the control incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms was half that observed in the initial study, and these neoplasms were increased over controls at all doses. These data suggest that in the initial study, H. hepaticus influenced the induction of hepatocellular neoplasms in males, but not in females."

A volume of 1.8 mL/kg was applied daily for 10 wks prior to mating, during mating, and through gestation and lactation. No effect on mating or fertility or offspring growth or survival was observed. A similar study was performed in which Swiss CD-1 mice were given daily applications of 2 g/kg triethanolamine at a volume of 3.6 mL/kg. No adverse developmental effects were observed."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of triethanolamine can be estimated to be 10(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that triethanolamine is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of triethanolamine is 7.76(3), indicating that this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4)."
