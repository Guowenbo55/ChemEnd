However, information about the transfer and cell diffusion characteristics of pesticides in vegetables is insufficient. In this study, we investigated the uptake, translocation, and subcellular distribution behaviors of four commonly used pesticides in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) under laboratory hydroponic conditions. Root uptake of pesticides followed the order of fenbuconazole > avermectin > thiamethoxam > spirotetramat. Thiamethoxam was more readily translocated from the root to the shoot, while spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin preferentially accumulated in the root. Cell soluble components were the dominant storage compartment for thiamethoxam, while the majority of spirotetramat, fenbuconazole, and avermectin were partitioned into the cell walls. These findings contribute to our understanding of pesticide bioconcentration behavior in food crops and help in evaluating the threats of pesticide residues to human health via the food chain.",
