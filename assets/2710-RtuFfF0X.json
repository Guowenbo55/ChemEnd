            "Value": "H1 antagonists inhibit most response of smooth muscle to histamine. Antagonism of the constrictor action of histamine on respiratory smooth muscle is easily shown or in vitro. ... Within the vascular tree, the H1 antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor effects of histamine and, to a degree, the more rapid vasodilator effects that are mediated by H1 receptors on endothelial cells. Residual vasodilatation reflects the involvement of H2 receptors on smooth muscle and can be suppressed only by the concurrent administration of an H2 antagonist. Effects of the histamine antagonists on histamine induced changes in systemic blood pressure parallel these vascular effects. /H1 Antagonists/"
