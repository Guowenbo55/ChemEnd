It is a methyl ester and an imidazolone. It is functionally related to a 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-4-methylbenzoic acid.",

(wild oat), as well as the herbicides' phytotoxicity under water stress conditions. The results showed that water stress reduced the absorption and translocation of both herbicides when plants were harvested within 24 hours after application. However, the effect diminished after 48 hours. Water stress also reduced the phytotoxicity of fenoxaprop-ethyl but not imazamethabenz-methyl when applied as individual droplets. These findings suggest that changes in herbicide absorption and translocation may not be the major physiological processes driving the differential response of Avena fatua to fenoxaprop-ethyl and imazamethabenz-methyl under water stress.",
