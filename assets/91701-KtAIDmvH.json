Scop. \u266f DIGSA], and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm. \u266f SETFA). Treating the soil and plant foliage at 0.035 or 0.07 kg ai/ha did not result in greater phytotoxicity than exposing only the foliage of each grass to the herbicide. Foliar-applied fluazifop was retained on the foliage in similar amounts by each of the species. Translocation of 14C to all plant parts was detected 6 h after foliar application of the butyl ester of 14C-fluazifop to the grasses in the pretillering or tillering stage. The majority (90%) of 14C absorbed by each of the species remained in the treated leaf. In hydroponic studies, each species exuded 14C into nutrient solution following foliar application of the 14C-labeled herbicide. The exuded material was predominantly fluazifop with small amounts of compounds more polar than the butyl ester of fluazifop. Uptake and translocation studies suggest that the greater sensitivity of goosegrass to fluazifop may be related to higher concentrations of the herbicide present in plant tissue.",

Merr.], linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), and palm (Eleais quineeneis Jacq.) oil than with petroleum oil. However, fluazifop absorption and translocation continued to increase for the 96-h duration of the experiment when applied with soybean oil but only for 24 h when applied with petroleum oil. The 14C-fluazifop-label recovery was higher when applied with oils than when applied alone, which may have been due to reduced fluazifop volatility when it was emulsified with the oils. Absorption and translocation of fluazifop applied with glycerol or various emulsifiers were equal to or less than fluazifop absorption and translocation when applied with petroleum oils but were greater than fluazifop absorption and translocation when applied with seed oils 48 h after application. Fluazifop absorption and translocation were similar whether soybean or petroleum oil additives were applied with or without emulsifiers. Totally refined seed oils only slightly increased fluazifop absorption and translocation compared to fluazifop with once-refined or degummed seed oils.",

Haloxyfop was the only herbicide where recovery decreased between the 3-and 48-h interval. All plants absorbed more of the herbicide at the 48-h interval than at the 3- or 6-h interval under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. Increased drought stress caused more acropetal movement with fluazifop and sethoxydim and less acropetal movement with quizalofop at the 3-h interval.
