            "Value": "The average BCFs in the whole body of carp exposed to 3-chloroaniline in flow-through experiments (25 \u00b0C, 12 L/hr) for 24 to 336 hr at high (14.7 ug/L) and low (0.67 ug/L) exposure levels were 0.8 and 2.2, respectively(1). Excretion was rapid with depuration rates and half-lives of 0.21/hr and 3.3 hr, respectively(1). This conclusion is supported by field data in which the concentration of 3-chloroaniline in water and fish were <0.02 - 0.02 ug/L and <2.0 ng/g(1). Uptake was rapid in static tests (0.17 umol/L, 26 \u00b0C) on zebrafish and a BCF of 11.5 was obtained for 100 hr exposure (2). Elimination was best described by a two compartment first order model(2). After 52 hr of depuration, the concn of 3-chloroaniline in the zebrafish declined to 10.3% of the steady state value.  According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a test using a Warburg respirometer, 50% of the theoretical BOD was measured for 3-chloroaniline over a 190 hr incubation period(1). A 100% loss of UV absorbance of 3-chloroaniline in a mineral salts solution, with a soil inoculum, required an excess of 64 days(2). Using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum, 97.2% of initial 3-chloroaniline was degraded under the test conditions(3). Biological transformation (20% degradation in 6 hr) was observed in an aqueous test system receiving activated sludge from two treatment plants(4). In the Zahn-Wellens test, 100% DOC removal was obtained in 17 days(7). Incubation of 3-chloroaniline (50 mg/50 g soil) in soil for 14 days resulted in formation of 3,3'-dichloroazobenzene(5). No dichloroazobenzene was formed using sterilized soil(5). 3-Chloroaniline was degraded (85-90%) with no lag period by a  mixed culture of containing Pseudomonas (12 species) and Bacillus (15 species), which was isolated from sludge that was acclimated to nitroaniline(6). 3-Chloroaniline may degrade in soil by chemical and microbial processes(8). When 3-chloroaniline (30 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased(8). The percent of 3-chlororaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 38% and 18%, respectively(8)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In a 3-day cultivation test using 2 different river waters from Japan and two different sea waters, 50% of initial 3-chloroaniline was degraded; the degradation was paralleled by growth of microbes(1,4). On this basis, 3-chloroaniline was judged to be readily biodegradable(4). A biotransformation half-life of 0.4 year was determined for 3-chloroaniline in laboratory studies using two pond and one river water samples obtained near Athens, GA(2). The primary biotransformation product is 4-chlorocatechol(2). In laboratory studies examining the persistence of 3-chloroaniline in water, no significant difference was observed in the degradation rate in pond water, pond water plus sewage sludge inocula, or sterile water over a 14 day period(3). This suggests that degradation is mostly chemical in nature(SRC)."

            "Value": "The Koc of 3-chloroaniline is estimated as 250(SRC), using a log Kow of 1.88(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3-chloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). In laboratory persistence studies using non-sterilized Hagerstown silty clay loam soil, 73% of applied 3-chloroaniline remained chemically bound to soil particles after 64 days of incubation(6). A related chemical, 2-chloroaniline, has been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution; the initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone(7)."
