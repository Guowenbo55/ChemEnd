            "Value": "The organothiophosphate diazinon inhibits the target site acetylcholinesterase only after activation to its metabolite diazoxon. Commonly, the toxicity of xenobiotics toward aquatic organisms is expressed as a function of the external concentration and the resulting effect on the individual level after fixed exposure times. This approach does not account for the time dependency of internal processes such as uptake, metabolism, and interaction of the toxicant with the target site. Here, ...a mechanistic toxicodynamic model for Daphnia magna and diazoxon /is developed/, which accounts for the inhibition of the internal target site acetylcholinesterase and its link to the observable effect, immobilization, and mortality. The model was parametrized by experiments performed in vitro with the active metabolite diazoxon on enzyme extracts and in vivo with the parent compound diazinon. The mechanism of acetylcholinesterase inhibition was shown to occur irreversibly in two steps via formation of a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex. The corresponding kinetic parameters revealed a very high sensitivity of acetylcholinesterase from D. magna toward diazoxon, which corresponds well with the high toxicity of diazinon toward this species. Recovery of enzyme activity but no recovery from immobilization was observed after in vivo exposure to diazinon. The toxicodynamic model combining all in vitro and in vivo parameters was successfully applied to describe the time course of immobilization in dependence of acetylcholinesterase activity during exposure to diazinon. The threshold value for enzyme activity below which immobilization set in amounted to 40% of the control activity. Furthermore, the model enabled the prediction of the time-dependent diazoxon concentration directly present at the target site."

Conversely, CYPs also detoxify these OPs to trichloropyridinol (TCP) and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMHP), respectively. In addition, A-esterase (PON1) metabolism of CPF- and DZN-oxon also forms TCP and IMHP. This study evaluated the role intestinal and hepatic metabolism may play in both the activation and detoxification of CPF and DZN in Sprague-Dawley rats. Similar CYP- and PON1-mediated metabolic profiles were demonstrated in microsomes from liver or isolated intestinal enterocytes. The metabolic efficiency was estimated by calculating the psuedo-1st order rate constant from the metabolic constants by dividing Vmax/Km. In enterocyte microsomes, the CYP metabolic efficiency for metabolism to the oxon metabolites was approximately 28-fold greater for CPF than DZN. Compared on a per nmol P450 basis, the Vmax for CPF in enterocytes was approximately 2-3 times higher than in liver microsomes for the production of CPF-oxon and TCP. The Michaelis-Menten rate constant (Km) for the metabolism of CPF to CPF-oxon was comparable in liver and enterocyte microsomes; however, the enterocyte Km for TCP production was higher (indicating a lower affinity). The smaller volume of intestine, lower amount of CYP, and higher Km for TCP in the enterocyte microsomes, resulted in a lower catalytic efficiency (2 and 62 times) than in liver for oxon and TCP. PON1-mediated metabolism of CPF- and DZN-oxon was also demonstrated in liver and enterocyte microsomes. Although PON1 affinity for the substrates was comparable in hepatic and enterocytic microsomes, the Vmax were 48- to 275-fold higher, in the liver."

The resultant strain was 1400-fold resistant to diazinon (LD50: 50 ug per fly) when compared to the susceptible CSMA strain. It had increased activity in each of the three enzyme systems involved in detoxification. Cytochrome p450 dependent monoxygenases catalyzed diazinon degradation, producing diethyl phosphorothioic acid and diethyl phosphoric acid. Glutathione transferase mediating dealkylation and deakylation reactions degraded both diazinon and diazonon. Phosphorotriester hydrolase activity for diazinon was detected only in the resistant strain and was present in all the subcellular fractions examined. The activity was highest in the soluble fraction. The resistant strain also showed a decreased sensitivity to inhibition at the site of action, AChE. Interstrain comparison in AChE sensitivity using diazoxon as the inhibitor revealed a 6-fold difference in the bimolecular rate constant ki. An extremely high resistance of this housefly strain to diazinon may be attributable to a synergistic effect of multiple factors."

In addition, an increase of phosphorous content (approximately 50%) in protamines, especially in the phosphoserine content (approximately 73%), was found at 8 days post-treatment. Sperm viability, motility, and morphology showed significant alterations at this time. These data strongly suggest that spermatozoa exposed during the late steps of maturation were the targets of DZN exposure. The correlation observed between the phosphorous content in nuclear protamines with DFI%, DFI, and CMA(3) provides evidence that phosphorylation of nuclear protamines is involved in the OP effects on sperm chromatin."

Individual F1 females were crossed to mutant males, and the progenies were scored for resistance to diazinon and for presence of mutatnt phenotypes. A major chromosome II gene for resistance to diazinon was present in all populations at an overall frequency of 83%. Map distances between the resistance gene and the mutant aristapedia and between the mutants aristapedia and stubby wing were highly variable in all populations. Recombination among the visible mutants was usually reduced in resistant progenies relative to susceptible progenies. The data suggest that a single major gene for resistance to diazinon was present on chromosome II in all test populations at variable map positions and is usually associated with a chromosome rearrangement, probably an inversion. The results are similar to those obtained earlier with house fly populations selected for resistance to insecticides in the laboratory; therefore, they seem to be characteristic of field and laboratory populations of the house fly.

These results strongly suggest that the organophosphorous toxicity observed in this culture system is not mediated by buildup of extracellular acetylcholine resulting from inhibition of AChE. The toxicity of chlorpyrifos was attenuated by antagonists of either the /N-methyl-D-aspartate/ (NMDA) or /alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/ (AMPA)/kainate-type glutamate receptors, but the cell death was potentiated by the caspase inhibitor /benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp/ (ZVAD). Diazinon toxicity was not affected by glutamate receptor antagonists, but was attenuated by ZVAD. Chlorpyrifos induced diffuse nuclear staining characteristic of necrosis, while diazinon induced chromatin condensation characteristic of apoptosis. Also, chlorpyrifos exposure increased the levels of extracellular glutamate, while diazinon did not. The results suggest two different mechanisms of neurotoxicity of the insecticides, neither one of which involved acetylcholine. Chlorpyrifos induced a glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, while diazinon induced apoptotic neuronal death."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ ... The outgrowth of axon-like processes by differentiating mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells was shown to be inhibited by exposure to 10uM diazinon. ... N2a cells were induced to differentiate for 24 hr in the presence and absence of 10 microM diazinon and 20% (v/v) conditioned medium derived from differentiating rat C6 glioma cells. Cells were then stained or lysed for morphological and biochemical analyses, respectively. The data showed that co-treatment with conditioned medium prevented the neurite inhibitory effect of diazinon. Furthermore, a significant recovery was also observed in the reduced levels of neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) observed as a result of diazinon treatment in the absence of conditioned medium, as seen by densitometric analysis of Western blots of cell lysates probed with monoclonal antibodies N52, BRM-22 and GAP-7B10. By contrast, no significant change was noted in the reactivity of cell lysates with antibodies against alpha- and beta-tubulin under any condition tested. After pre-incubation with a polyclonal anti-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) antibody, the conditioned medium derived from rat C6 glioma cells lost its ability to protect N2a cells against the neurite inhibitory effects of diazinon. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that C6 conditioned medium protects N2a cells from the neurite inhibitory effects of diazinon by blocking molecular events leading to axon damage and that GDNF is implicated in these effects."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Preconfluent cultures of normal rat intestinal cells (IEC-6 cell line) and normal human colonic epithelial cells were treated with 0.05-50 muM doses of atrazine, diazinon, and endosulfan. After 3 days of treatment, the change in cell proliferation was quantified by cell counting or the MTT growth assay. Both intestinal and colonic epithelial cell cultures had increases in cell growth when treated with as little as 1.0 muM atrazine, diazinon, or endosulfan. The observed changes in both cultured intestinal and colonic cell growth rates were not due to the influence of the vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). That is, the treatment of the cell cultures with concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide as high as 0.5% for 3 days resulted in no change in cell growth compared with untreated control cultures. A consistent observation with all three of the compounds was that the highest doses (50 muM) had the least \"proliferative potential\" in stimulating either IEC-6 cell or human colonic epithelial cell growth. Within the concentration range used, none of the herbicides or pesticides caused a decrease in cell proliferation below that of the untreated control cultures. Overall, treatment of IEC-6 cell cultures with atrazine, diazinon, or endosulfan produced a biphasic growth response, whereas the same treatment in the human colonic epithelial cell cultures produced a more sustained level of growth over the same period."

Analysis showed that the diazinon had decomposed by hydrolysis into a range of breakdown products, including tetraethyldithiopyrophosphate (sulfotepp) and monothiono-tetraethylpyrophosphate (monothiono-TEPP), which are much more toxic to mammals than diazinon. In the second incident, four yearling bulls were affected within 48 hours of being treated with a liquid that the farmer believed to be a lice treatment but was actually old diazinon sheep dip. Three of the bulls recovered but one died four days after the treatment. Analysis of the dip confirmed the presence of diazinon but in this incident no breakdown products were detected."
