    "Description": "Sulfentrazone is a member of the class of triazoles that is 5-oxo-1,2,4-triazole which is substituted at positions 1, 3, and 4 by 2,4-dichloro-5-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]phenyl, methyl, and difluoromethyl groups, respectively. A protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, it is used as a herbicide to control broad-leaved weeds in soya and tobacco crops. Not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a sulfonamide, a dichlorobenzene, an organofluorine compound and a member of triazoles.",

            "content": "Observations highlighted distinct absorption and translocation patterns of sulfentrazone among these species. Common lambsquarters and jimsonweed exhibited significantly higher absorption of sulfentrazone compared to potato after 24- and 48-hour exposures. Furthermore, translocation of sulfentrazone from roots to shoots was notably greater in the weed species than in potato. These findings propose that the variance in sulfentrazone tolerance among these plants stems primarily from the differences in root absorption and translocation of the herbicide from roots to shoots. Such variations in herbicide uptake and movement within the plant structure significantly influence its efficacy and potential impact on different plant species.",

Uptake and translocation of sulfentrazone was rapid and was not affected by the addition of clomazone. Fifty-nine and 65% of the 14C absorbed by the plant was translocated to the leaves within 24 h with sulfentrazone alone and in the clomazone plus sulfentrazone mixture, respectively. Differences in plant metabolism were observed between sulfentrazone alone and sulfentrazone plus clomazone. After 3 h, 66% of the 14C recovered from the leaves was metabolized when sulfentrazone was applied alone, compared to 91% when sulfentrazone was applied with clomazone. The difference could indicate that metabolism of sulfentrazone by tobacco transplants was enhanced by the presence of clomazone",
