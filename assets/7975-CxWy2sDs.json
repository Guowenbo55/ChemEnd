            "Value": "AEROBIC: 2-Methylpyridine was reported as readily biodegradable in the MITI test(1). In an aerobic screening test using an enrichment culture obtained from soil as an inoculum, 100% degradation was obtained in 14 to 32 days(2). When this test was repeated under anaerobic conditions, degradation was much slower, requiring >97 days for complete biodegradation(2). Only 2.7% of the added 2-methylpyridine (initial concentration of 2 umoles/g) remained after 16 days following incubation in a silt loam soil(3). Complete biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine, initially added at 4 mg/L, was reported in aerobic groundwater incubated at 15 \u00b0C for 4 days(4). In an aerobic column study where subsurface sediment was leached with contaminated groundwater, 65% of the initially applied 2-methylpyridine was removed after 5 weeks of operation(5). Complete biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine was observed in 24 days following incubation in a defined medium inoculated with soil(6). Contaminated groundwater, from the American Creosote Works Superfund site in Pensacola, FL, was incubated with 2-methylpyridine; 33, 33, 33, 66, and 100% degradation was reported after incubation for 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 days, respectively(7). 2-Methylpyridine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0.1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(8)."

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed and histological examinations were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hr or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline and pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these compounds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological examination of the eyes showed similar effects for all four compounds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, and cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, and pyridine had primary irritation index values of 5.8, 6.8, and 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a PII value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline and 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, and regeneration. ..."

Male Long-Evans-hooded-rats were implanted with electrodes. Visual function, paired flash evoked potential, pattern reversal evoked potentials, auditory function, brainstem auditory evoked responses, and cerebral excitability were measured, and hippocampal after discharge were performed. The median lethal dose (LD50) was assessed after 12, 28, and 35 rats were given 100 to 300 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of 2-methylpyridine, 3-methylpyridine, or 4-methylpyridine. Effects on rectal temperature in animals injected with 100mg/kg of the drugs were determined. Sensitivity to pharmacologically induced seizures was determined after administration of 50mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (54955), intraperitoneally. Controls were treated with saline. The LD50s were 200mg/kg for 2-methylpyridine, 150mg/kg for 3-methylpyridine, and 162mg/kg for 4-methylpyridine. Death occurred within 24 to 48 hours after treatment. All of the methylpyridines produced a mild hypothermia. 3-Methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine affected electrophysiological parameters more than did 4-methylpyridine. The authors conclude that all three compounds produce dysfunctions that only vary in magnitude."

To determine which Maillard reaction products are important in the formation of IQ-type mutagens in boiled pork juice, six Maillard reaction products were separately added to the porkjuice before reflux boiling and then the mutagenicity of each sample was examined with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix. The addition of four Maillard reaction products enhanced the mutagenicity of pork juice 1.2-2.9-fold after reflux boiling. The highest level of enhancement was observed with tetrahydrothiophene, followed by 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 3-methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine.

The pKa of 2-methylpyridine is 5.96(2), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(3). In the Eurosoil column tests(1), lowest adsorption occurred when 2-methylpyridine was in non-ionized form(1). Sorption of 2-methylpyridine to soil is primarily controlled by cation exchange and surface complex formation(1,4). According to a classification scheme(5), the Koc values suggest that 2-methylpyridine is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil."
