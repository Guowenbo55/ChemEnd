Nocardia calcerea hydroxylated the ring to form a substituted catechol. Meta cleavage between carbons 2 and 3 ensued to give 2-hydroxy-5-methylmercaptomuconic semialdehyde from MMP and the corresponding sulfinyl analog from MSP. MSO2P was hydroxylated to form 4-methylsulfonylcatechol. In this case ortho cleavage occurred, splitting the ring between atoms 1 and 2 to form 3-methylsulfonylmuconic acid."

            "Value": "The half-life of fensulfothion in sterilized (via autoclaving) sandy loam soil (organic matter 2.9%) and organic soil (organic matter 48.7%) exceeded 24 weeks but the half-life in non-sterilized soil was 1 week or less, which is suggestive of significant microbial degradation(1). Field application of 50 ppm fensulfothion was reduced to 5 ppm after 120 days in the first year of application; however, in the second year of application, less than 0.2 ppm remained after 60 days, which was attributed to microbial adaptation; the microorganisms involved in the degradation were identified as a species of Pseudomonas(2). Incubation of a nutrient media with soil microorganisms resulted in a 60% fensulfothion degradation over a 20-week period as compared to a 45% degradation in sterile controls; a fensulfothion sulfone metabolite was found in inoculated samples but not sterile samples; fensulfothion sulfide, in small amounts, was found in both sterile and inoculated samples; addition of 1% ethanol to inoculated samples to induce anaerobic conditions resulted in a rapid disappearance of fensulfothion (half-life of 1.5 weeks) with a large conversion to fensulfothion sulfide(3). Fensulfothion degraded rapidly in a sandy loam soil to fensulfothion sulfone(4). In a greenhouse study using an organic soil containing 65% organic matter, the initial half-life of fensulfothion applied at normal insecticidal concn was about 3 to 5 weeks with a slightly faster disappearance exhibited in wetter soil(5). Persistence of fensulfothion (as measured by larvae mortality) varied from 3 to 10 weeks in greenhouse and field studies of a sandy loam soil(6)."

Water and ditch sediment samples were taken in early spring in the first wk of May each year starting in 1985, prior to any pesticide application. Subsequent samples were taken in July, shortly after treatment. Further samples were obtained during the rainy and wet season, ie, in Oct, Dec, and Feb of the following year. Fensulfothion was not detected in ditch water (detection limit = 1 ug/l), but low levels were found at 2 sites in the July 1985 samples of ditch sediments (10.3 ug/kg)."

The results indicated that fensulfothion was taken up systemically by the plants from the treated soils. The researchers conducted a pot trial where they mixed specific amounts of 32P-labeled fensulfothion with soil in pots and sowed the pasture seeds. The plants were harvested at different time points, and their tissues were analyzed to determine the presence of fensulfothion. The analysis involved extracting the plant tissues with water and chloroform, and the resulting extracts were assayed for 32P activity. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on the chloroform extracts to further analyze the chemical composition."
