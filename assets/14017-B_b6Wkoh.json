    "Description": "(aminomethyl)phosphonic acid is a member of the class of phosphonic acids that is phosphonic acid substituted by an aminomethyl group. It is a metabolite of the herbicide glyphosate. It is a one-carbon compound and a member of phosphonic acids. It is functionally related to a phosphonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (aminomethyl)phosphonate(1-).",

The research investigates the binding capacity of activated carbon (AC) and calcium montmorillonite (CM) clay to reduce the bioavailability of AMPA in soil and its translocation to plants. Adsorption studies reveal that both AC and CM exhibit strong binding affinity for AMPA, with high capacities based on the Langmuir model. Additionally, the inclusion of 1% AC and CM in the hydra assay demonstrates a significant 90% protection against AMPA toxicity. Further experiments in glyphosate-contaminated soil and genetically modified (GM) corn plants demonstrate that AC and CM effectively decrease AMPA bioavailability and residue levels in roots and sprouts. These findings highlight the potential of AC and CM as efficient sorbents for reducing the environmental impact of AMPA, offering a promising strategy for mitigating the effects of glyphosate and its metabolites in agricultural settings.",
