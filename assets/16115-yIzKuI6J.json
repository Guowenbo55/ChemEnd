    "Description": "Chloroxuron is a member of the class of phenylureas that is N,N-dimethylurea in which a hydrogen of the amino group is replaced by a 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl group. It is a phenylurea herbicide used for the control of annual grasses, mosses and broad-leaved weeds. Common crop plants for which the herbicicide is useful are soy beans, onions, strawberries, and celery. It has a role as a herbicide. It is an aromatic ether, a member of phenylureas and a member of monochlorobenzenes.",

Upon following the breakdown of chloroxuron as a function of time in two weed species, Polygonum convolvulus was demonstrated to metabolize chloroxuron more rapidly than Galinsoga parviflora. Under aerobic conditions, a soil inoculum at a temperature of 30 \u00b0C and an incubation time of 28, 42 and 112 days, biodegradation of chloroxuron was 29, 25, and 29 percent, respectively. In an autoclaved control, 14 percent chloroxuron biodegradation occurred. Under aerobic conditions, a soil inoculum at a temperature of 30 \u00b0C and an incubation time of 56 days, biodegradation of chloroxuron was 35 percent. In samples of humus soil and sandy loam, the rate of chloroxuron breakdown was slightly higher in sandy loam (35 percent loss in 8 weeks) than in humus soil (25 percent loss in 8 weeks) under optimal growth conditions. In humus soil, breakdown decreased with time, thereby suggesting that desorption of chloroxuron was too slow to maintain sufficient soil solution concentration. In autoclaved humus soil, breakdown was considerably less pronounced (15 percent loss in 16 weeks) than in non-autoclaved samples(1)."

The study investigated the effects of root and foliar applications of chloroxuron on the plants. In the root uptake studies using carbonyl-14C-labeled chloroxuron, it was found that soybean roots absorbed more than 90% of the total radioactivity, while tall morning glory roots absorbed approximately 60% of the total radioactivity. When it came to the distribution of radioactivity in the leaves of the plants, 1, 2, and 3-week-old soybean plants had 0.8%, 3.7%, and 3.5% of the total radioactivity in their leaves, respectively. On the other hand, the leaves of corresponding age in tall morning glory plants contained 29.1%, 33.0%, and 37.4% of the total radioactivity. The metabolism of chloroxuron from root uptake was similar in both species. The identified metabolites were approximately 85% chloroxuron, 13% 3-(p-(p-chlorophenoxy)phenyl-1-methylurea (Compound II), and 2.5% 3-(p-(p-chlorophenoxy)phenylurea (Compound III)) in 3-week-old plants. In a nutrient solution containing 5.6 X M chloroxuron, soybean plants with intact roots were tolerant to the herbicide, while plants with detached roots were susceptible. This indicated that differential translocation, or the movement of the herbicide within the plant, played a crucial role in the selective action of chloroxuron from root uptake. Following foliar spray and washing of 2-week-old plants, tall morning glory foliage absorbed approximately twice as much radioactivity as soybean foliage. Additionally, 18 hours after foliar application, chloroplasts isolated from tall morning glory contained twice as much 14C-chloroxuron as soybean chloroplasts. The concentrations of metabolites recovered from foliar treatment of both species were similar, with approximately 88.1% to 92.2% chloroxuron, 6.4% to 8.6% Compound II, and 0.5% to 1.7% Compound III.",
