It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a doxorubicin(1+). It derives from a hydride of a tetracene.",

            "Value": "Doxorubicin hydrochloride is an antineoplastic antibiotic with pharmacologic actions similar to those of daunorubicin. Although the drug has anti-infective properties, its cytotoxicity precludes its use as an anti-infective agent. The precise and/or principal mechanism(s) of the antineoplastic action of doxorubicin is not fully understood. It appears that the cytotoxic effect of the drug results from a complex system of multiple modes of action related to free radical formation secondary to metabolic activation of the doxorubicin by electron reduction, intercalation of the drug into DNA, induction of DNA breaks and chromosomal aberrations, and alterations in cell membranes induced by the drug. Evidence from in vitro studies in cells treated with doxorubicin suggests that apoptosis (programmed cell death) also may be involved in the drug's mechanism of action. These and other mechanisms (chelation of metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes) also may contribute to the cardiotoxic effects of the drug."

            "Value": "Doxorubicin undergoes enzymatic 1- and 2-electron reduction to the corresponding semiquinone and dihydroquinone. 7-Deoxyaglycones are formed enzymatically by 1-electron reduction, and the resulting semiquinone free radical reacts with oxygen to produce the hydroxyl radical in a cascade of reactions; this radical may lead to cell death by reacting with DNA, RNA, cell membranes, and proteins. The dihydroquinone that results from 2-electron reduction of doxorubicin also can be formed by the reaction of 2 semiquinones. In the presence of oxygen, dihydroquinone reacts to form hydrogen peroxide, and in its absence, loses its sugar and gives rise to the quinone methide, a monofunctional alkylating agent with low affinity for DNA. The contribution of dihydroquinone and the quinone methide to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is unclear. Experimental evidence indicates that doxorubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, causing inhibition of DNA synthesis and DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by the resulting template disordering and steric obstruction. Doxorubicin also inhibits protein synthesis. Doxorubicin is active throughout the cell cycle including the interphase."

            "Value": "Several anthracycline-induced effects may contribute to the development of cardiotoxicity. In animals, anthracyclines cause a selective inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression for ?-actin, troponin, myosin light-chain 2, and the M isoform of creatine kinase, which may result in myofibrillar loss associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Other potential causes of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include myocyte damage from calcium overload, altered myocardial adrenergic function, release of vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Limited data indicate that calcium-channel blocking agents (eg, prenylamine) or beta-adrenergic blocking agents may prevent calcium overload ... It has been suggested that the principal cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free radical damage to DNA."

            "Value": "Anthracyclines intercalate DNA, chelate metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes, and generate oxygen free radicals via oxidation-reduction reactions. Anthracyclines contain a quinone structure that may undergo reduction via NADPH-dependent reactions to produce a semiquinone free radical that initiates a cascade of oxygen-free radical generation. It appears that the metabolite, doxorubicinol, may be the moiety responsible for cardiotoxic effects, and the heart may be particularly susceptible to free-radical injury because of relatively low antioxidant concentrations. ... Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by the drug results in a doxorubicin-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals, and the complex is a powerful oxidant that can initiate lipid peroxidation in the absence of oxygen free radicals. This reaction is not blocked by free-radical scavengers, and probably is the principal mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity."

            "Value": "The effect of doxorubicin on reactive oxygen metb in rat heart was investigated. It produced oxygen radicals in heart homogenate, sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and cytosol, the major sites of cardiac damage. Superoxide prodn in heart sarcosomes and the mitochondrial fraction was incr. Apparently, free radical formation by doxorubicin, which occurs in the same myocardial compartments that are subject to drug-induced tissue injury, may damage the heart by exceeding the oxygen radical detoxifying capacity of cardiac mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum."
