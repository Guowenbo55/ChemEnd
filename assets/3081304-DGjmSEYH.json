Two experiments were conducted: I. Evaluation of the uptake and translocation of 14C-diclosulam (35 g a.i. ha\u22121) in C. juncea at seven and 14 days after emergence. II. Evaluation of chlorophyll a transient fluorescence of dark-adapted C. juncea leaves when diclosulam was applied in pre-emergence. Plants of C. juncea exhibited an anatomical/metabolic barrier to diclosulam translocation in the stem, which could contribute to their tolerance to this herbicide. Furthermore, reduced translocation was observed due to low accumulation in the cotyledons. Additionally, the plants were able to maintain an active photosynthetic metabolism even when grown in soil with diclosulam without altering the dynamics of energy dissipation. Therefore, when cultivated in soil with residual diclosulam, C. juncea demonstrated the ability to tolerate the herbicide and sustain plant growth.",

The absorption, translocation, dose response, efficacy, and biomass effects of diclosulam were evaluated. In the laboratory experiments, absorption and translocation of 14C-diclosulam in bristly starbur were assessed. Greenhouse studies involved applying diclosulam postemergence at various doses (ranging from 0 to 6.5 g ai/ha) to determine its impact on bristly starbur growth. Bristly starbur seeds collected from two locations in Georgia were grown in the greenhouse, and the plants were treated with diclosulam when they reached the 4 to 6 leaf stage. Translocation of 14C-diclosulam was observed within 24 to 48 hours, primarily towards the plant apex, with limited movement to lower plant parts. Dose response studies revealed that diclosulam resulted in growth reduction and efficacy in bristly starbur, with GR50 (growth reduction dry weight) and I50 (efficacy) values ranging from 0.33 to 1.08 g ai/ha, respectively. The susceptibility of bristly starbur to diclosulam was attributed to its translocation to apical growing points, where inhibition of acetoacetate synthase (ALS) occurred, eventually leading to plant death. While diclosulam controlled bristly starbur at rates below the standard use rate for other weeds, the recommendation for peanut growers is to use standard field rates in combination with other herbicide mechanisms of action to minimize the potential for ALS resistance selection in bristly starbur.",
