Pesticides concentration (10 uM) was used for in vitro incubations of cell-free homogenates labelled with (32)P orthophosphate. Heptachlor (HC) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (o-p' DDT) increased phosphatidyl-inositol, phosphatidylinositolphosphate, and phosphatidyl-inositolbiphosphate phosphorylation while azinphosmethyl (AM) increased phosphatidylinositolbiphosphate labeling. Decreased (32)P incorporation in phosphatidylinositol was found with phosmet (PM), AM, and chlorpyriphos (CHL). The effects of these xenobiotics on PI4-kinase activity using different subcellular fractions were also examined. Both type of pesticides affected the postmembrane supernatant enzyme activity. A biphasic effect on membrane and nuclear PI4-kinase activity was seen with HC. The strongest effect found was seen with o-p' DDT in nuclear kinase activity while substantial changes were also observed in membrane. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of human placental PI4-kinase to pesticides currently found in human tissues and suggest deleterious consequences in different processes regulated by 4-phosphoinositides."

            "Value": "... Under agricultural working conditions, OPs primarily are absorbed through the skin. Liver P-450 isozymes catalyze the desulfurization of phosphorothioates and phosphorodithioates (e.g., parathion and azinphosmethyl, respectively) to the more toxic oxons (P = O(S to O)). In some cases, P-450 isozymes catalyze the oxidative cleavage of P-O-aryl bonds (e.g., parathion, methyl parathion, fenitrothion, and diazinon) to form inactive water-soluble alkyl phosphates and aryl leaving groups that are readily conjugated with glucuronic or sulfuric acids and excreted. In addition to the P-450 isozymes, mammalian tissues contain ('A' and 'B') esterases capable of reacting with OPs to produce hydrolysis products or phosphorylated enzymes. 'A'-esterases hydrolyze OPs (i.e., oxons), while 'B'-esterases with serine at the active center are inhibited by OPs. OPs possessing carboxylesters, such as malathion and isofenphos, are hydrolyzed by the direct action of 'B'-esterases (i.e., carboxylesterase, CaE). Metabolic pathways shown for isofenphos, parathion, and malathion define the order in which these reactions occur, while Michaelis-Menten kinetics define reaction parameters (Vmax, K(m)) for the enzymes and substrates involved, and rates of inhibition of 'B'-esterases (kis, bimolecular rate constants) by OPs and their oxons. OPs exert their insecticidal action by their ability to inhibit AChE at the cholinergic synapse, resulting in the accumulation of acetylcholine. The extent to which AChE or other 'B'-esterases are inhibited in workers is dependent upon the rate the OP pesticide is activated (i.e., oxon formation), metabolized to nontoxic products by tissue enzymes, its affinity for AChE and other 'B'-esterases, and esterase concentrations in tissues. Rapid recovery of OP BChE inhibition may be related to reactivation of inhibited forms. AChE, BChE, and CaE appear to function in vivo as scavengers, protecting workers against the inhibition of AChE at synapses."

In rats there was some evidence of decreased survival at the highest dose compared with controls, but this was not seen in mice. In both sexes at all doses, survival to termination was adequate for assessment of effects on late-appearance tumors. The report concluded that the incidence of tumors of the pancreatic islets, and of follicular cells in the thyroid in males suggested, but did not clearly implicate, azinphos-methyl as a carcinogen in rats. There was no similar evidence in female rats, and in male and female mice there was no increased incidence of tumors that could be related to the administration of azinphos-methyl."

During the first phase, pregnant rats and mice were treated for 10 days, starting on gestational day 6. During the second phase, pregnant rats were treated from day 6 of gestation to day 21 post partum.  In the first phase, maternal toxicity was seen only in rats receiving the high dose. When dams and fetuses were examined (day 18 of gestation for mice, day 20 for rats) there was no dose-related increase in anomalies or malformation in rats or mice. In the second phase, dams in the high-dose group were more sensitive to azinphos-methyl in the latter stages of gestation and signs of anticholinesterase intoxication, including mortality, were observed. As a result, only one litter (out of 13) survived to weaning in this group. It was concluded that azinphos-methyl had little primary effect on development in rats and mice."

Twelve of the rats in each group were used for behavioral testing with half of these being used for neuropathology. The remaining six males and six females per group were tested for cholinesterase activity. There were no deaths before terminal sacrifice. Treatment-related clinical signs (perianal stain, red lacrimation, increased reactivity, uncoordinated gait, tremor) were evident by cage-side observations in males at 120 ppm and in females at 45 and 90 ppm. Body weight (reduced by 9-10%) and food consumption were affected by treatment at the highest dose for males (120 ppm) and females (90 ppm).

Signs of toxicity persisted with continued exposure, but there was no evidence of cumulative toxicity beyond week 4. Treatment-related decreases in motor and locomotor activity were observed in males at the highest dose during weeks 4, 8, and 13 of exposure, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity beyond week 4, and in females at the highest dose during week 4 only.

Of the treated rats, six males and six females in satellite groups were used for determinations of cholinesterase activity and the remainder were involved in testing for changes in neurobehavior. Five males (one in the main study and four in the satellite group) and fifteen females (nine in the main study and all in the satellite group) in the group at the highest dose died. Treatment-related clinical signs in males were muscle fasciculations (2 out of 12 and 8 out of 11 at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw respectively), tremors (1 out of 11 at 12 mg/kg bw), uncoordinated gait (1 out of 11 at 12 mg/kg bw), oral stain (3 out of 12 and 10 out of 11 at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw, respectively), and urine stain (1 out of 12, 2 out of 12 and 10 out of 11 at 2, 6 and 12 mg/kg bw, respectively) and red nasal stain (2 out of 12, 2 out of 12 and 7 out of 11 at 2, 6 and 12 mg/kg bw, respectively). One of the three surviving females at 6 mg/kg bw had oral and urine staining for about 2 days after treatment. All clinical signs that did not involve staining were only observed about 30 min after treatment on the day of dosing. Staining was typically observed from between 1 to 3 days after dosing. There were no treatment-related differences in group mean body weights of the surviving animals. Treatment-related functional observational battery (FOB) findings were recorded at the time of maximal inhibition of cholinesterase activity (i.e. about 90 min after dosing) at doses of 1 mg/kg bw or greater on day 0, but not at any dose on day 7 or 14 after treatment. ... In addition, males at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw and females at 6 mg/kg bw had significantly lower (p < 0.05) body temperature after treatment on day 0, and appeared to be treatment-related. Males and females at the highest dose had significantly reduced forelimb grip performance (by about 31% and 27%, respectively). Similarly, significant reductions (p < 0.05) in hindlimb grip performance were noted only in males at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw (reduced by 18% and 30%, respectively). These manifestations were attributed to acute cholinergic effects of the test substance. Foot splay was unaffected by treatment. In males, the response profile of remaining reflex/physiological observations such as touch (5 out of 12 and 6 out of 12), righting (slightly uncoordinated, 6 out of 12 and 3 out of 12) and righting (land on side, 2 out of 12 and 5 out of 12) for the groups at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw, respectively, was significantly different (p < 0.05) from the controls and appeared to be treatment-related, although a dose-response relationship was not always observed. Maze activity in treated rats was lower on day 0 (by about 64%, 60%, 77% and 79% for males at 0, 2, 6 and 12 mg/kg and 71%, 78%, 79% and 85% for females at 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg bw, respectively) compared with the corresponding values reported before treatment and appeared to be treatment-related. In comparison to the concurrent controls, dose-related reductions in motor activity were seen in males at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw (about 36% and 43%, respectively), and in females (about 19% for the groups at 1 and 3 mg/kg bw and about 44% at 6 mg/kg bw). The reduced motor activity in males and females of the control group noted on day 0 was attributed to overnight fasting. In males, the motor activity was depressed by about 14% at 12 mg/kg bw relative to that of the controls, with partial recovery on day 7, and complete recovery of activity was seen by day 14. In females, motor activity appeared to be slower to recover, showing deficits of about 20%, 10% and 8% at 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg bw, respectively, relative to values for the corresponding controls on day 14. Dose-related changes in locomotor activity were also noted in males on day 0, with about 47% and 77% depressions at 6 and 12 mg/kg bw respectively, relative to values for the corresponding controls. In females, the reductions in locomotor activity were about 26%, 15% and 63% at 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg bw respectively, in comparison to those for the parallel controls. Complete recovery of locomotor activity was seen in all males and females, except for males at 12 mg/kg bw that showed a deficit of 20% compared with the controls by day 7. Complete recovery was seen in all animals by day 14. Treatment-related reductions were also seen in interval motor and locomotor activities on day 0 after treatment, but recovery was complete by day 7. Habituation was not affected by treatment. ... No intergroup differences were noted in terminal body weights, brain weight, gross pathology and histopathology of treated rats of either sex. The NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw per day on the basis of a significant reduction in brain cholinesterase activity at higher doses."

The following clinical signs were observed for up to 6 hr: apathy, spasm, shivering, twitching, difficulty in breathing, salivation. Despite the ability of the positive control compound to increase the % micronucleated PCEs/1000/animal, no such ability was clearly forthcoming from the test article. Also, neither the positive controls nor the test article showed clear differences from controls in the PCE/NCE ratio. E 1582 is not considered to induce micronuclei in this system under the conditions tested."

            "Value": "The Koc of azinphosmethyl in five European soils was measured in the range of 487 to 4,644(1). Azinphosmethyl also had Koc values of 1990 (75.0% clay, 3.29% organic carbon), 783 (22.6% clay, 2.39% organic carbon), 570 (17.0% clay, 3.32% organic carbon), 630 (20.3% clay, 1.36% organic carbon) and 1700 (6.0% clay, 4.43% organic carbon) in five European soils(2). Using data from the 1993 UK database, Koc values for azinphosmethyl were 298 to 3406(3). According to a classification scheme(4), this Koc data suggests that azinphosmethyl is expected to have moderate to slight mobility in soil. Measurable residues were found in sediment samples after application to the surface of littoral enclosure mesocosms; the sediment and water were identified as the most important sorptive compartments(5). The compound is not likely to leach to groundwater except in areas of high recharge such as karst(6)."

            "Value": "No azinphosmethyl was detected (detection limit was 0.4 ppm) below the top 2 inch soil layer in an apple orchard where 4 applications of azinphosmethyl totaled 3 pounds/acre(1). Azinphosmethyl was not transported deeply into the soil of an irrigated potato field. Traces were found at a soil depth of 12-30 cm but none was found below 30 cm(2). In a thin layer chromatography (TLC) experiment, azinphosmethyl was found to have a low mobility in Hagerstown soil (silt clay loam, 1.4% organic content)(3). In another study, soil TLC experiments were conducted using azinphosmethyl and 14 different soils(4); the average Rf value for azinphosmethyl was 0.17. Field moisture capacity (FMC) and organic matter content of a soil were found to be a good predictor of mobility. Increased FMC decreased the soil mobility in the TLC experiments(4). No azinphosmethyl was detected in a soil column effluent after 64 days and batch studies indicate that sorption was not reversible(5). An experimental Koc of 189 (Kom of 110) has been reported(6) but the isotherm was not linear. The pesticide root zone model (PRZM - designed to predict pesticide movement in unsaturated soils within and below the root zone in agricultural systems) was applied to study pesticide movement in a 25 ha managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest near Comer, GA(7). The model indicates that azinphosmethyl has little potential to leach to ground water, given a Kd value of 10, Koc of 1,000, and a soil half-life of 40 days(7). A mean Kd of 8.94 in nine soils was also reported(8)."
