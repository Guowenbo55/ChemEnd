            "Value": "An estimated BCF of 10 was calculated in fish for 4-aminoazobenzene(SRC), using a log Kow of 3.41(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). It was postulated that the compound may become bound to tissues by a reaction between the amino group and tissue constituents(4)."

Two other screening tests reported no BOD consumption with sewage and activated sludge inocula after 5 and 6 day incubations, respectively(2,3). In view of the long acclimation period required in the first sceening test, a possible explanation for the lack of biodegradation in the other tests is an inadequate incubation time(SRC). However, in a more recent 5-day screening test using acclimated cultures, 0% of the theoretical BOD was used(4)."

            "Value": "The profile of ras gene mutations in spontaneous CD-1 mouse liver tumors were compared with that found in liver tumors that were induced by a single ip injection of either 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, 4-aminoazobenzene, N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, or N-nitrosodiethylamine. By direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplified tumor DNA, the carcinogen induced tumors were found to have much higher frequencies of ras gene activation than spontaneous tumors. Furthermore, each carcinogen caused specific types of ras mutations not detected in spontaneous tumors, including several novel mutations not previously associated with either the carcinogen or mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. For example, the model compound 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is known to cause predominantly A to T transversions in Ha-ras codon 61 in mouse skin and mammary tumors, consistent with the ability of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene to form bulky adducts with adenosine. The results demonstrate that the predominant mutation caused by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in mouse liver tumors is a G to C transversion in Ki-ras codon 13 (7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is also known to form guanosine adducts), illustrating the influence of both chemical and tissue specific factors in determining the type of ras gene mutations in a tumor. 4-Aminoazobenzene and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene also caused the Ki-ras codon 13 mutation. In addition, we found that N-nitrosodiethylamine, 4-aminoazobenzene, and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene all caused G to T transversions in the N-ras gene (codons 12 or 13). This is the first demonstration of N-ras mutations in mouse liver tumors, establishing a role for the N-ras gene in mouse liver carcinogenesis. Finally, comparison of the ras mutations detected in the direct tumor analysis with those detected after NIH3T3 cell transfection indicates that spontaneous ras mutations (in Ha-ras codon 61) are often present in only a small fraction of the tumor cells, raising the possibility that they may sometimes occur as a late event in CD-1 mouse hepatocarcinogenesis."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-aminoazobenzene is expected to have low mobility in soil. Anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5)."
