At concentration typically applied to soil, dinoseb may biodegrade(2). Pseudomonas aeroginosa and P putida grew readily with dinoseb as a sole source of carbon, although it was not degraded by DNOC-degrading bacteria(2). Incubation of 5 ppm dinoseb in soil at 25 \u00b0C for 60 days resulted in evolution of 36.0% of the applied (14)C carbon as (14)C carbon dioxide(3). Dinoseb has been classified as unlikely to be degraded by even extended exposure to conventional biological sewage treatment process(4)."

An ESR study showed lowering of cytochrome p450 of the liver throughout the observation period, changes in the cytochrome c oxidase, lowering of iron-sulfur-containing proteins (54% in 6 hr), and a decrease in the free radical level as compared to the original levels. The metalloprotein and free radicals, observed 30 min after dinoseb, showed a tendency to normalization."

            "Value": "The measured soil-sorption coefficient (Koc) of dinoseb is 124(1). A Koc of this magnitude suggests that dinoseb will be highly mobile in soil and may leach to groundwater. A much higher Koc value of 6607 wa obtained at a buffered pH of 3(2). It appears that soil sorption may be pH dependent and at low pH adsorption may be stronger. It has been shown, however, that p-nitrophenol adsorbs strongly to clays through an interaction between the nitro group and the water molecules or metallic cations in the clay(3). Dinoseb may similarly bind to clays at low pH. Experiments with soil thin layer chromatography showed that dinoseb was intermediate to very mobile in silt loam sand loam and silty loam soils(4)."

            "Value": "Dinoseb, a herbicide studied in the context of its effect on filbert (Corylus avellana L.) suckers, demonstrates a limited ability to translocate within plants. Unlike certain other herbicides like 2,4-D which can move through the phloem and affect sites of active cell division, dinoseb's translocation capabilities are notably restricted. In experiments, residues of dinoseb were not detected in plant portions distant from points of foliar or root application. This lack of significant translocation is highlighted by observations that injury was mainly noted on bud scales rather than the growing points of the buds. The implications of dinoseb's limited translocation become apparent when considering its effectiveness in controlling filbert suckers. While dinoseb may have a localized impact, its inability to move extensively within the plant restricts its ability to address below-ground portions of the suckers, in contrast to herbicides like 2,4-D. As a result, careful timing of dinoseb application becomes crucial to target young and susceptible filbert suckers effectively, particularly before they exceed 12 inches in height."
