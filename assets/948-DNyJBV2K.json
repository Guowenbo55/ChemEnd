    "Description": "Dinitrogen oxide is a nitrogen oxide consisting of linear unsymmetrical molecules with formula N2O. While it is the most used gaseous anaesthetic in the world, its major commercial use, due to its solubility under pressure in vegetable fats combined with its non-toxicity in low concentrations, is as an aerosol spray propellant and aerating agent for canisters of 'whipped' cream. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic, a NMDA receptor antagonist, a bacterial metabolite, a general anaesthetic, a vasodilator agent, an analgesic, a member of greenhouse gas, a raising agent, a member of food packaging gas, a food propellant and a refrigerant. It is a nitrogen oxide and a gas molecular entity.",

            "Value": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) gas is a widely used anesthetic adjunct in dentistry and medicine that is also commonly abused. Studies have shown that N2O alters the function of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), GABAA, opioid, and serotonin receptors among others. However, the receptors systems underlying the abuse-related central nervous system effects of N2O are unclear. The present study explores the receptor systems responsible for producing the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O. B6SJLF1/J male mice trained to discriminate 10 minutes of exposure to 60% N2O + 40% oxygen versus 100% oxygen served as subjects. Both the high-affinity NMDA receptor channel blocker (+)-MK-801 maleate [(5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] and the low-affinity blocker memantine partially mimicked the stimulus effects of N2O. Neither the competitive NMDA antagonist, CGS-19755 (cis-4-[phosphomethyl]-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid), nor the NMDA glycine-site antagonist, L701-324 [7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxy)phenyl-2(1H)-quinolinone], produced N2O-like stimulus effects. A range of GABAA agonists and positive modulators, including midazolam, pentobarbital, muscimol, and gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-3-ol), all failed to produce N2O-like stimulus effects. The mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid agonists, as well as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1B/2C (5-HT1B/2C) and 5-HT1A agonists, also failed to produce N2O-like stimulus effects. Ethanol partially substituted for N2O. Both (+)-MK-801 and ethanol but not midazolam pretreatment also significantly enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O. Our results support the hypothesis that the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O are at least partially mediated by NMDA antagonist effects similar to those produced by channel blockers. However, as none of the drugs tested fully mimicked the stimulus effects of N2O, other mechanisms may also be involved."

            "Value": "Nitrous oxide is 35 times more soluble than nitrogen. The gas exchanges with nitrogen and diffuses into hollow viscera and body spaces potentially containing air, such as pneumothorax, paranasal sinuses and pneumoperitoneum, or into the cerebral ventricles following pneumoencephalography. This expands the body of trapped air and increases the pressure within such closed spaces. When administration is discontinued, nitrous oxide is released into the alveoli, diluting the alveolar gases. A  reduction in alveolar oxygen tension may result. This is referred to as  diffusion anoxia. Because of the high concentration of nitrous oxide required to produce and maintain anesthesia, hypoxia is an unavoidable accompaniment to its use. During induction with high concentrations of nitrous oxide, the oxygen in the lungs is rapidly used up and the anoxia with increased respiratory effort causes rapid depletion of carbon dioxide in the tissues. Absence of carbon dioxide and depression of the medullary centers by the anesthetic quickly lead to respiratory failure, and rarely, the patient's cerebral function fails to recover from cerebral damage caused by the prolonged anoxia. The brain suffers anoxia from the very beginning of the administration of the gas, and not from just the moment of cessation of  respiratory movements. Thus, the period of anoxia may be five minutes or more, sufficient to cause permanent brain damage in the susceptible individual. The arbitrary \"safe period\" of eight  minutes may be too long for some patients."

The mechanism of analgesia is believed to involve a direct intraspinal anti-nociceptive action rather than depression of limbic function. In the brain stem, responses evoked by pain stimulation are depressed, although the extent of depression may be variable. Nitrous oxide in anesthetic doses increases cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) inhalation is known to inactivate hepatic cobalamin dependent methionine synthase leading to methionine deficiency and trapping of tetrahydrofolate in the methyl-tetrahydrofolate form. Liver tissue from rats (strain not given) exposed to N2O for 48 hr exhibited a coordinate decr in all three activities of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase of approx 25%. A corresponding 25% decr in immunoreactive C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase was also observed after 48 hr. Thus, the decr in the concn of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase accounted entirely for the decr observed in the activities. Apparently, the perturbations of hepatic tetrahydrofolate pools by N2O affect the level of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase expression at a translational or pretranslational level."

            "Value": "Because the synaptic inhibition in the human brain is largely mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the GABA receptor is of primary interest for the study of the working mechanism of general anesthetics. This article examines the interaction between this type of ion channel and nitrous oxide (N2O). Patch clamp recording techniques were applied to investigate the effects of N2O on GABA(A) receptor channels in a whole-cell configuration at room temperature. Acutely dissociated /Wistar/ rat hippocampal cells from the CA1 region were used. Rapid application of the agonist muscimol and anesthetics (N2O, pentobarbital, and ethanol) was accomplished using a Y tube application system. Peak chloride (Cl-) currents were measured. Short-term application of muscimol (5-30 uM) with dissolved N2O (80%, approximately 22.5 mM) increased the Cl- current (approximately 140%) compared with muscimol alone. This effect is comparable with results the authors obtained with ethanol (800 mM) and pentobarbital (100 uM). Prolonged exposure (9 min) to N2O further increased Cl- currents by an additional 50%. Concentrations of N2O lower than 12 mM did not show an enhancement of this current, whereas application of N2O alone did not result in any Cl- conductance. These results indicate that N2O can enhance GABA(A) channel-mediated Cl- currents by modulating the effect of the specific GABA(A) agonist; it is not active by itself."

Each of the 4 anesthetic exposed groups showed some deviations from normal mitosis, but only the postnatal N2O group showed the pattern of reduced cell proliferation followed by a rebound that is characteristic of many antimitotic teratogens. Although prenatal N2O's effects on the fetal brain were not clearly interpretable, it did delay development of blood, as has been reported by other investigators. Both N2O and halothane reduced body wt of fetuses in utero, but did not reduce body wt of neonates. The pattern of the body wt effects suggest that they occur by some mechanism other than reduced cell production."

To better understand the neural effects of inhalational anesthetics, we studied the behavioral and biochemical changes in aged rats that were exposed to sevoflurane (Sev) and nitrous oxide(N2O) for 4 hr. Eighteen-month-old rats were randomly assigned to receive 1.3% sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen or 50% oxygen for 4 hr. Spatial learning and memory were tested with the Morris water maze 48 hr after exposure, and the results showed that sevoflurane-nitrous oxide exposure induced a significant deficit in spatial learning acquisition and memory retention. Experiments revealed that the cAMP and pCREB levels in the dorsal hippocampus were decreased in rats with anesthetic exposure in comparison with control rats 48 hr after anesthesia as well as 15 min after the probe trial, but there were no significant differences in CREB expression. Besides these, the current study also found the DG neurogenesis significantly decreased as well as neuronal loss and neuronal apoptosis increased in the hippocampus of rats exposed to Sev+N2O. The current study demonstrated that down-regulation of cAMP/CREB signaling, decrease of CREB-dependent neurogenesis and neuronal survival in the hippocampus contributed to the neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction induced by general anesthesia with sevoflurane-nitrous oxide."

The authors aimed to clarify (1) whether nitrous oxide preconditions the heart, (2) how it affects protein kinase C (PKC) and tyrosine kinases (such as Src) as central mediators of preconditioning, and (3) whether isoflurane-induced preconditioning is influenced by nitrous oxide. METHODS: For infarct size measurements, anesthetized rats were subjected to 25 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Rats received nitrous oxide (60%), isoflurane (1.4%) or isoflurane-nitrous oxide (1.4%/60%) during three 5-min periods before index ischemia (each group, n = 7). Control animals remained untreated for 45 min. Additional hearts (control, 60% nitrous oxide alone%, and isoflurane-nitrous oxide [0.6%/60%, in equianesthetic doses]) were excised for Western blot of PKC-epsilon and Src kinase (each group, n = 4). RESULTS: Nitrous oxide had no effect on infarct size (59.1 +/- 15.2% of the area at risk vs. 51.1 +/- 10.9% in controls). Isoflurane (1.4%) and isoflurane-nitrous oxide (1.4%/60%) reduced infarct size to 30.9 +/- 10.6 and 28.7 +/- 11.8% (both P < 0.01).

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ BACKGROUND: Alveolar macrophages (AM) are known to play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory reactions in the lung, e.g. during the development of chronic lung diseases. Exposure of rats to NO2 has recently been shown to induce a shift in the activation type of AM that is characterized by reduced TNF-alpha and increased IL-10 production. METHODS: AM from rat and mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface marker expression and in vivo staining with PKH26 was applied to characterize newly recruited macrophages. Following magnetic bead separation, AM subpopulations were further analyzed for cytokine, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mRNA expression using quantitative RT-PCR. Following in vitro stimulation, cytokines were quantitated in the culture supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: In untreated rats the majority of AM showed a low expression of the surface antigen ED7 (CD11b) and a high ED9 (CD172) expression (ED7-/ED9high). In contrast, NO2 exposure induced the occurrence of a subpopulation characterized by the marker combination ED7+/ED9low. Comparable changes were observed in mice and by in vivo labeling of resident AM using the dye PKH26 /it could be demonstrated/ that CD11b positive cells mainly comprise newly recruited AM. Subsequent functional analyses of separated AM subpopulations of the rat revealed that ED7+ cells showed an increased expression and production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 whereas TNF-alpha production was lower compared to ED7- AM. However, iNOS and IL-12 expression were also increased in the ED7+ subpopulation. In addition, these cells showed a significantly higher mRNA expression for the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-7, -8, -9, and -12. CONCLUSION: NO2 exposure induces the infiltration of an AM subpopulation that, on the one hand may exert antiinflammatory functions by the production of high amounts of IL-10 but on the other hand may contribute to the pathology of NO2-induced lung damage by selective expression of certain matrix metalloproteinases."
