The present studies with individual hydrocarbon (HC) constituents of JP-8 jet fuel shed light on this issue. To mimic occupational scenarios, JP-8, 8 aliphatic HC (nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane) and 6 aromatic HC (ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene, cyclohexyl benzene, naphthalene, dimethyl naphthalene) soaked cotton fabrics were topically exposed to pigs for 1 day and with repeated daily exposures for 4 days. Erythema, epidermal thickness, and epidermal cell layers were quantitated. No erythema was noted in 1-day in vivo HC exposures but significant erythema was observed in 4-day tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, and JP-8 exposed sites. The aromatic HCs did not produce any macroscopic lesions in 1 or 4 days of in vivo exposures. Morphological observations revealed slight intercellular and intracellular epidermal edema in 4-day exposures with the aliphatic HCs. Epidermal thickness and number of cell layers significantly increased (p < 0.05) in tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, and JP-8-treated sites. No significant differences were observed in the aromatic HC-exposed sites. Subcorneal microabscesses containing inflammatory cells were observed with most of the long-chain aliphatic HCs and JP-8 in 4-day exposures. Ultrastructural studies depicted that jet fuel HC-induced cleft formation within intercellular lipid lamellar bilayers of the stratum corneum. The degree of damage to the skin was proportional to the length of in vivo HC exposures. These data coupled with absorption and toxicity studies of jet fuel HC revealed that specific HCs (tridecane and tetradecane) might be the key constituents responsible for jet fuel-induced skin irritation."

            "Value": "/BEHAVIORAL STUDIES/ This article reports the results of neurobehavioral tests on C(5)-C(10) normal paraffinic constituents (n-paraffins). Shortly after exposure, effects were evaluated in several domains including clinical effects, motor activity, functional observations, and visual discrimination performance. The representative C(5) n-paraffin, n-pentane, did not produce any evidence of acute central nervous system (CNS) effects at levels up to 20 000 mg/cu m. Similarly, there was no compelling evidence that n-octane (C(8)) produced CNS effects at 14 000 mg/cu m, the highest concentration tested. n-decane (C(10)) produced minor, reversible acute CNS effects at 5000 mg/cu m, with 1500 mg/cu m as the no-effect level. Consistent with literature data, there seemed to be a relationship between increasing molecular weight up to C(10) and acute CNS effects. However, the CNS effects were reversible. Repeated exposures did not provide evidence of metabolic induction."
