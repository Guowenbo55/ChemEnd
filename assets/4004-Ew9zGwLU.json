The present study was conducted to identify the mechanism of action of OP in terms of muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. Electromyography (EMG) was conducted on rats exposed to the acute oral dose of malathion (400 mg/kg) that could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity up to 70%. The function of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the rate of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from intact mitochondria were measured. The bioenergetic pathways were studied by measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate, and glycogen. To identify mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of bax and bcl-2, protein expression of caspase-9, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and DNA damage were measured. The EMG confirmed muscle weakness. The reduction in activity of mitochondrial complexes and muscular glycogen with an elevation of lactate was in association with impairment of cellular respiration. The reduction in mitochondrial proapoptotic stimuli is indicative of autophagic process inducing cytoprotective effects in the early stage of stress. Downregulation of apoptotic signaling may be due to reduction in ATP and ROS, and genotoxic potential of malathion. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by means of artificial electron donors and increasing exogenous ATP might prevent toxicity of OPs."

Malathion (200 mg/kg) and NAC (2 g/L) were administered orally to rats, during 28 consecutive days. Malathion increases plasma glucose, plasma insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels. Further, we observed an increase of insulin resistance biomarkers and a decrease of insulin sensitivity indices. The GP, GSK3beta and PEPCK mRNA expressions were amplified by malathion while, the expression of glucokinase gene is down-regulated. On the basis of biochemical and molecular findings, it is concluded that malathion impairs glucose homeostasis through insulin resistance and insulin signaling pathways disruptions in a way to result in a reduced function of insulin into hepatocytes. Otherwise, when malathion-treated rats were compared to NAC supplemented rats, fasting glucose and insulin levels, as well as insulin resistance indices were reduced. Furthermore, NAC restored liver GP and PEPCK expression. N-acetylcysteine showed therapeutic effects against malathion-induced insulin signaling pathways disruption in liver.

After induction of depression, different doses of minocycline were daily injected alone or combined with non-specific NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), specific inducible NOS inhibitor, AG, NO precursor, L-arginine, and PDE5I, sildenafil. After locomotion assessment in open-field test, immobility times were recorded in the FST and TST. Moreover, hippocampal nitrite concentrations and acetylcholinesterase activity were measured. The results showed that repeated exposure to malathion induces depressive-like behavior at a dose of 250 mg/kg. Minocycline (160 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility times in FST and TST (P < 0.001). Combination of sub-effective doses of minocycline (80 mg/kg) with either L-NAME (3 mg/kg) or AG (25 mg/kg) significantly exerted a robust antidepressant-like effect in FST and TST (P < 0.001). Furthermore, minocycline at the same dose which has antidepressant-like effect, significantly reduced hippocampal nitrite concentration. The investigation indicates the essential role for NO/cGMP pathway in malathion-induced depressive-like behavior and antidepressant-like effect of minocycline.

The aims of this study were to detect the initiation of the toxic effects of sub-acute low doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) of MAL by immunohistochemical and biochemical parameters in rat brain. Twenty-eight rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n=7) including control and three different amounts of MAL-exposed groups (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg). On immunohistochemical examination, the number of caspase-3-positive cells in all MAL-exposed groups was significantly higher than in the control group. Consistent with this, the total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, and the levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and paraoxanase activity were significantly different in the 5 and 10 mg/kg MAL-exposed groups compared with the control group. Additionally, the total oxidant status and malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in the 5 and 10 mg/kg MAL-exposed groups compared with those in the 2.5 mg/kg MAL-exposed group. Our results indicate that over 5 mg/kg MAL exposure may result in dose-dependent oxidative stress, increased caspase-3 activity, and launching to the toxic effects in rat brain."

Assessments included those of clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic examinations, hematology, clinical chemistry (including ChE activity of plasma, erythrocytes and brain), urinalysis and gross and histopathology of Guideline required tissues. Treatment had no effects on survival, body weights or food consumption. Cholinergic signs observed at 2.01 mg/L and sporadically in a few animals at the lower doses included red staining of the urogenital areas, excess salivation and ungroomed oily fur. Treatment-related histopathological lesions were seen in the nasal cavity and the larynx of both sexes of rats at all concentrations tested. The lesions in the nasal cavity were characterized as slight to moderate degeneration and/or hyperplasia of the olfactory epithelium which was locally extensive. The lesions of the larynx were characterized as epithelial hyperplasia, with squamous keratinization occurring in some rats. In addition, the olfactory/respiratory epithelial junction was severely affected in most animals. For systemic toxicity, a NOAEL was not established and the LOAEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day based on histopathologic lesions of the nasal cavity and larynx.

After exposure, biochemical markers and sperm analysis were evaluated and finally histological modifications of testis and sperm were assessed. Our data showed that treatment of male mice with malathion (500 mg/kg, BW) could lead to oxidative stress. Induced oxidative stress status can be assessed due to increased malondialdhyde (MDA) content, decreased thiol group content, as well as increased antioxidant enzyme activities. On the other hand, exposure to malathion at the pubertal age led to alteration of semen parameters; sperm production and percentage of motile sperm were decreased in the treated groups compared to the control.

Inhibition of this enzyme leads to an accumulation of free, unbound acetylcholine at nerve endings which leads to the symptoms and associated functional deficits known for AChE inhibitors: peripherally - smooth muscle contractions (e.g., abdominal cramps; glandular secretions (e.g,. sweating); skeletal muscle twitching; and, at higher concentrations, paralysis); centrally - possible effects on learning, memory and other behavioral parameters."

This study evaluated the effects of a repeated (15-day period) and low-dose malathion exposure on spatial memory and discrimination (object location task), as well as on biochemical parameters in the hippocampus of mice [AChE and mitochondrial chain complexes activities; levels of proapoptotic proteins (Bax and Bak) and cholinergic neuronal and astroglial markers (ChAT and GFAP, respectively)]. Malathion treatments (30 and 100 mg/kg, s.c.) did not affect the body weight of animals and caused no evident signs of cholinergic toxicity throughout the treatment, although the highest dose (100 mg/kg) was associated with inhibition of AChE activity. Malathion-exposed animals showed a significant impairment on spatial memory and discrimination, which was correlated with a decrease in the mitochondrial complex I activity in the hippocampus. Moreover, malathion increased the levels of proapoptotic proteins and induced astroglial activation. The results show that long-term malathion exposure, at a dose that does not affect hippocampal AChE activity (30 mg/kg), caused impaired spatial memory and discrimination in mice that was related to hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunctional, astrogliosis and apoptosis.

Moreover the molecular mechanism of malathion induced depressive- like behavior and its decreasing effect on the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex were evaluated. Male Wistar rats were exposed to malathion (50 mg/kg/day, IP) alone or in combination with crocin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, IP), imipramine (20 mg/kg/day, IP) and vitamin E (200 mg/kg, three times a week, IP) respectively for 14 days. The forced swimming test (FST) was performed on days 1, 7 and 14. The level of malondealdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats. The protein level of BDNF was evaluated using Western blot analysis. Malathion (50 mg/kg, IP) increased immobility time in the FST, without affecting total locomotor activity in open-field test. Malathion increased the malondealdehyde (MDA) and decreased the glutathione (GSH), whereas these effects were reversed by crocin and vitamin E. Malathion decreased plasma acetylcholinesterase activity, however this effect was not reversed by crocin or vitamin E. Malathion reduced the protein level of BDNF in rat hippocampus. Imipramine and crocin prevented the decreasing effect of malathion on BDNF. These results showed that crocin attenuates some neurochemical and behavioral effects induced by malathion. This neuroprotective effect of crocin may be in part due to its effect on BDNF."

In the current study we used zebrafish larvae in order to determine the effects of two of the most widely used organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, on zebrafish behavior and AChE activity. Embryos and larvae were exposed to the organophosphates during different time points in development and then tested at 5 days post-fertilization for behavioral, neurodevelopmental and AChE abnormalities. The results of the study indicate that chlorpyrifos and malathion cause opposing behaviors in the larvae such as swim speed (hypoactivity vs. hyperactivity) and rest. Additionally, the pesticides affect only certain behaviors, such as thigmotaxis, during specific time points in development that are unrelated to changes in AChE activity. Larvae treated with malathion but not chlorpyrifos also had significantly smaller forebrain and hindbrain regions compared to controls by 5 days post-fertilization.

After a preliminary range-finding assay, the concentrations used in the UDS assay were 0 (DMSO, untreated or ethanol), 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 or 0.16 uL/mL with an 18 hour incubation in the presence of 10 mCi/mL (3)H-thymidine. Incorporation of thymidine into nuclei was quantitated by autoradiography with 150 nuclei per concentration scored in morphologically normal cells in the 0.02 through 0.12 uL/mL groups. The positive control was 2-AAF and that treatment gave the anticipated results with 100% of nuclei having >/= 5 net grains. Treatment with malathion did not induce an increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis. No adverse effect with hepatocytes."

The roles of non enzymatic and enzymatic glutathione (GSH) conjugation of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate in these responses were studied. Antibody responses to T-dependent and T-independent antigens were evaluated after (i) direct culture with spleen or B cells; (ii) cocultivation of B cells with T cells with and without preincubation of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate with glutathione fortified cytosol. Antigen presentation by macrophages was also assessed after such treatment as compared to untreated controls. O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate preincubated with glutathione had an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxic T lymphocyte and the direct hemolytic plaque forming cell responses. This was found to be mediated by a direct inhibitory effect on macrophages, T and B cells of the immune system and not through the generation of regulatory suppressor T cells. Thus, the mode of suppressive action of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate in vitro is due to inhibition of lymphocytic proliferation. This is only possible in the presence of glutathione which was determined to be a prerequisite for the induction of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate suppressive effect. /O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate/"

These pesticides are highly toxic to humans and their residues in food pose potential threat to human health. In this comparative study, we investigated the effect of subchronic exposure of OPs (malathion, MAL) and CM (Carbosulfan, CB) on rat liver and spleen. Biochemical analysis showed that levels of hepatic enzymes (ALT, ALP, LDH and PAL) changed after exposure to the pesticides. In the liver extracts, lipid peroxidation index increased after the treatment by pesticides. Our results indicated that exposure to MAL and CB leads to alteration of liver redox status. Both pesticides induced focal inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. After subchronic administration of MAL (200 mg/kg) and CB (25 mg/kg), systemic inflammation, as depicted by the increase in IFN-delta activity in liver, was observed in both malathion and carbosulfan treated animals. In addition, the results showed that MAL significantly increased TCD4+ and TCD8+ lymphocyte number. It also decreased INF-delta and IL-4 production. However, CB induced a reduction of TCD8+ number and cytokine production in spleen cells. In conclusion, malathion and carbosulfan had significant immunomodulatory properties in the spleen with inflammation and oxidative stress induction in the liver."

In rat thoracic aorta segments contracted with phenylephrine (Phe) (10-7 mol/L), malathion (10-10 to 10-5 mol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxation in arteries with intact endothelium (n = 7; p < 0.05).

In thoracic aorta rings, with and without endothelium, Phe (10-10 to 10-5 mol/L) evoked concentration-dependent contraction, which was reduced in the presence of malathion. In rings with or without endothelium, incubated with malathion, L-NAME and indomethacin, the Phe-induced contraction was restored. The role of NO was confirmed using flow cytometry. Malathion evokes endothelium-dependent relaxation through the M1 muscarinic receptor, since this relaxation was clearly blocked by atropine (M1 and M2 blocker) and pirenzepine (M1 blocker), but was less blocked by gallamine (M2 blocker) or 4-DAMP (M3 blocker)."
