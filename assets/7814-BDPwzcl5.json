An 80% degradation of 1,4-benzenediamine (25-30 mg/l) with acclimated activated sludge in 120 hr at 20 \u00b0C has been reported(2). Aniline-acclimated activated sludge led to 8% theoretical BOD in 190 hr at 20 \u00b0C(3). No degradation of 500 mg/l 1,4-benzenediamine was observed with 3 activated sludges in 24 hr at 20 \u00b0C, the test compound was toxic to the 3 sludges(4). A 0% theoretical BOD was observed for 1,4-benzenediamine in a Warburg apparatus during a 5 day incubation period(5). 3.8% Biodegradation was observed when 1,4-diaminobenzene dihydrochloride (initial concentration unspecified) was incubated with an activated sludge inoculum obtained from a municipal sewage treatment facility over a 5 day incubation period(6)."
