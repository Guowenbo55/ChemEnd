Free-swimming rainbow trout, partitioned hexachloroethane preferentially into fat tissue with a blood:water and fat tissue:blood ratio of 61 and 175, respectively, following 600 hours exposure; uptake was characterized by a very slow accumulation of hexachloroethane in the fat compartment(3).

Hexachloroethane transformation was not observed in poisoned samples(2)."

It is structurally similar to pentachloroethane, which also causes renal tumors in male rats. Pentachloroethane has been shown to increase the renal cortical concentrations of alpha2u-globulin and stimulate renal cell proliferation. Although these comparisons suggest that hexachloroethane acts through an alpha2u-globulin associated mechanism, the available data are insufficient to fulfil the criteria for establishing this mechanism."

Retardation factor estimates ranging from 1.80 to 3.01 (relative to chloride) were calculated for hexachloroethane based on laboratory and field studies using aquifer solids(6). The retardation factor was most highly affected by a decrease in pore-water velocity and therefore residence time; retardation factors increased by >50% with a 20-fold decrease in pore-water velocity(6)."
