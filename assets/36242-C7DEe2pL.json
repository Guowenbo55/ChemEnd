The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",

The fungicide disappeared from the plants with a half-life of 20 days after foliar application at a rate of 250 \u00b5g per leaf. Procymidone was metabolized in plants via hydroxylation at the methyl or the 4-position of the phenyl group, or hydrolysis at the cyclic imide linkage. It was found to be very little translocated to other parts of the plants, including edible portions. When the fungicide was applied to the surface of a cucumber fruit, approximately 24% of the applied radioactivity penetrated into the fruit in a day, but there was no significant increase thereafter. When bean plant seedlings were cultivated for 42 days in soils treated with 10 ppm of 14C-procymidone, shoots, pods, and seeds contained 12.3-15.3 ppm and 0.42-0.66 ppm of 14C, respectively.
