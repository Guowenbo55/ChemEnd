    "Description": "Boscalid is a pyridinecarboxamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-chloronicotinic acid with the amino group of 4'-chlorobiphenyl-2-amine. A fungicide active against a broad range of fungal pathogens including Botrytis spp., Alternaria spp. and Sclerotinia spp. for use on a wide range of crops including fruit, vegetables and ornamentals. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of biphenyls, a pyridinecarboxamide, a member of monochlorobenzenes and an anilide fungicide. It is functionally related to a nicotinic acid.",

            "Value": "Boscalid is a new-generation fungicide that has been detected in several bee matrices. The objective of this work was to characterize boscalid metabolites in honeybees based on in vivo experimentation, and next to verify the presence of these metabolites into honeybees from colonies presenting troubles. A methodology based on complementary mass spectrometric tools, namely ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToF) or triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ) was implemented. Honeybees were sprayed with boscalid, at field rate (to induce the metabolization process) and the parent compound with its generated metabolites were then extracted using modified EU-QuEChERS method. The mass characteristics including exact mass, isotopic profile and mass fragments allowed assuming the structure of several metabolites. Some of them were unambiguously identified by comparison with synthesized analytical standards. The metabolites were resulted from hydroxylation and dechlorination of the parent compound as well as the substitution of a chlorine atom with an hydroxyl group. The metabolites were then quantified in bee samples collected from various beehives located in France. Boscalid and three of its metabolites were present in some samples at a level ranged between 0.2 and 36.3 ng/g."

            "Value": "There is considerable and ongoing debate as to the harm inflicted on bees by exposure to agricultural pesticides. In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73 nanogram/gram (ng/g). It is notable that pollen collected by bumble bees in rural areas contained high levels of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (mean 18 ng/g) and thiacloprid (mean 2.9 ng/g), along with a range of fungicides, some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Pesticide exposure of bumble bee colonies in urban areas was much lower than in rural areas. Understanding the effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to complex mixtures of pesticides remains a major challenge."

It also examined the behavior of these pesticides during thermal processes ranging from 40\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C in two apple varieties. Gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed for analytical investigations. Variations in pesticide concentrations between the pulp and skin were observed depending on the apple variety. Pirimicarb showed the highest transfer to the pulp, while boscalid and deltamethrin remained predominantly on the skin. Surprisingly, boscalid was found to be more present in the apple skin than in the pulp. Drying and dry pasteurization processes were the most effective in reducing pesticide levels in apples with and without skin, respectively. Thermal processes resulted in processing factors ranging from 0.06 to 0.98 for ten pesticides, with acetamiprid being the only pesticide whose levels were not decreased. The study discussed the relationship between pesticide distribution, behavior, and physico-chemical properties, particularly water solubility. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pesticide efficacy and removal in apples.",

            "Value": "Boscalid is a new broad-spectrum fungicide belonging to the class of carboxamides (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors). It is effective against different stages of fungal development, mainly against spore germination and germ tube elongation but inhibits also other stages of fungal development such as appressoria formation or mycelial growth. After leaf uptake, boscalid is transported translaminarily and acropetally. Boscalid is very safe to the plants and covers a wide disease spectrum. It controls a broad range of fungal pathogens in arable and speciality crops including ornamentals. Sensitivity studies with laboratory mutants and field isolates of Botrytis cinerea showed that different mutations in the ubiquinone binding site of the target gene can affect the sensitivity towards carboxamides. Based on this knowledge, monitoring assays based on genetic analysis have been developed to improve the sensitivity monitoring of target pathogens targeted by boscalid."
