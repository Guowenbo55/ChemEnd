    "Description": "3,4-dimethylaniline is a primary arylamine that is aniline in which the hydrogens at the 3- and 4-positions are replaced by methyl groups. A low-melting, crystalline solid, it is used in the production of vitamin B2, dyes, pesticides and other chemicals. It is a dimethylaniline and a primary arylamine.",

            "Value": "3,4-Xylidine, present at 30 mg/l, reached 7.1% of the theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(1). In the Japanese MITI test, 3,4-xylidine (present at 100 mg/l) was classified as slow to biodegrade indicating that only 0-29% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(2). 3,4-Xylidine, present initially at 252 mg/L, was removed at a biodegradation rate of 30 mg COD/g-hr by an activated sludge inoculum(3). E.coli converted 3,4-xylidine to the corresponding (phenylazo)naphthol in the presence of nitrate with this reaction proceeding within 24 hours(4)."

            "Value": "The Koc of 3,4-xylidine is estimated as approximately 240(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 1.84(1) and a regression-derived equation(2,SRC). According to a recommended classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3,4-xylidine has moderate mobility in soil(SRC). However, anilines are expected to bind stongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5). Low adsorption is observed at a neutral pH with pure clay minerals or soils for substituted anilines(5)."
