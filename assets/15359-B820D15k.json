            "content": "The study investigates the factors influencing the absorption and translocation of pesticides by the hypocotyls (stem-like embryonic plant structures) of intact radish seedlings. Specifically, the research focuses on triazine herbicides such as simazine, atrazine, and atraton. The findings suggest that the uptake and translocation processes are predominantly passive and not significantly influenced by factors such as humidity, concentration, light, and aqueous solubilities of the compounds. The rate at which atrazine and simazine are translocated to the cotyledons is primarily determined by diffusion across the hypocotyl tissues, rather than the rate of transpiration. Additionally, there appears to be a qualitative relationship between the percentage of compounds translocated to the upper part of the shoots and their partition coefficients in oil/water systems. The study also briefly discusses the relative importance of pesticide uptake by roots and shoots in field conditions.",

            "content": "Barley plants were exposed to six herbicides and a systemic fungicide (four triazines, diuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and ethirimol). The relationships between uptake and transpiration rate were discussed in the light of the physico-chemical properties of these compounds, notably their partition coefficients in oil/water systems and their dissociation constants. Apart from 2,4-D, sorption of these compounds appears to be a passive process. At pH 4, the uptake of 2,4-D seems to be influenced by metabolism; not only may the concentration of this compound in the transpiration stream be considerably greater than that in the medium surrounding the roots, but absorption by roots is markedly reduced at low temperatures and by sodium azide. The initial rate of uptake of these compounds correlates reasonably well with their partition coefficients in olive oil/water or ra-dodecane/water systems; likewise, the concentration in the transpiration stream is greater for lipophilic than for lipophobic substances. The hydrogen ion and calcium concentrations of the ambient medium appear to have no effect on the uptake of compounds with low pK's, but the uptake of those substances which protonate between pH 4 and pH 6 is affected by them. These findings are discussed from the viewpoint that the pathways of transport of lipophilic and lipophobic compounds across the roots may differ.",
