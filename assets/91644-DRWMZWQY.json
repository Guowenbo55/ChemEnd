While effective against many weeds, some perennial weeds have shown tolerance to this herbicide. Research indicates that selectivity is not solely based on differential absorption but may also involve metabolism into water-soluble compounds, such as glutathione conjugates. Glutathione S-transferase, an enzyme catalyzing this conjugation, appears to play a role in pretilachlor selectivity. The study aimed to investigate absorption, metabolism, and translocation of pretilachlor in various plant species, including susceptible and tolerant weeds, to elucidate its selective mechanism.",

Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) were very tolerant to pretilachlor, while Echinochloa crus-galli (P. Beauv.) was completely controlled by pretilachlor at 60 g a.i./10a. At 120 g a.i./10a, the growth of Cyperus serotinus Rottb. and Sagittaria pygmaea Mig. was inhibited by 75% and 25%, respectively. The growth inhibition depended on the absorbed amount of C-pretilachlor. The greatest concentration of 14C was found in E. crus-galli, whereas the lowest was determined in rice plants. The rate of absorption and translocation in E. crus-galli was faster than in rice plants. Pretilachlor moved to 6 cm deep in sandy clay loam, clay loam, and loam soils, but to 10 cm in sandy loam soil. In the soils, the herbicide-treated layer was found in the 0 to 2 cm profile.",
