Both 14C-chlorsulfuron and l4C-metsulfuron were readily absorbed by wild garlic, with 62 and 58%, respectively, of the applied doses absorbed 144 h after application. After 144 h, 17% of the applied 14C-chlorsulfuron and 16% of the applied 14C-metsulfuron were translocated out of the treated leaf, with the greatest amounts concentrating in young shoot tissues. Chlorsulfuron and metsulfuron reduced wild garlic shoot dry weight, height, and the number of leaves, more when they were applied to the foliage, or to both the foliage and the soil, than when they were applied to the soil alone.",
