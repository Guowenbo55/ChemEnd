    "Description": "Diclofenamide is a sulfonamide that is benzene-1,3-disulfonamide in which the hydrogens at positions 4 and 5 are substituted by chlorine. An oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, it partially suppresses the secretion (inflow) of aqueous humor in the eye and so reduces intraocular pressure. It is used for the treatment of glaucoma. It has a role as an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor, an antiglaucoma drug and an ophthalmology drug. It is a sulfonamide and a dichlorobenzene.",
