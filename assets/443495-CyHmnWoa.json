Total blood arsenic levels were increased in all animal species. This increase was dose, arsenic species, and animal dependent. Renal pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was significantly decreased at early time points in mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs, and at later time points in rats dosed with arsenite. Rats and mice dosed with arsenate also exhibited PDH decrease at early time points. Blood hematocrit and glucose were increased in the rat and guinea pig, respectively, after arsenite administration. Creatinine and urea nitrogen were found to be unresponsive to arsenic in most animal species.

The first stage was an increase in the cytosolic free heme without significant effects on the content of cytochrome P450 or on bilirubin excretion. The second stage consisted of a continuous fall of the cytosolic free heme and of the content of cytochrome P450. These changes were concurrent with an eight-fold increase in heme oxygenase activity and associated with marked elevations in the biliary excretion of bilirubin. The bile was collected from chronically cannulated rats to avoid artifacts related to anesthesia or post anesthetic effects. The rapid increase in biliary excretion of labeled heme degradation products indicated an increased breakdown of newly synthesized heme. Immunoelectrophoresis of bile proteins showed an altered pattern of bile protein excretion. The increased biliary haptoglobin suggested some hemolysis, while the reduction in the free immunoglobulin A secretory component showed an AsIII-related decreased protein transport across hepatocytes to bile. Further research is required to assess the direct role of an increased heme degradation in the genesis of the hepatotoxic effects of AsIII."

The relationship between heme synthesis and degradation was altered as a result of As treatment. The magnitude of these effects was related to the oxidation state of arsenic, sodium arsenite (AsIII) being more potent than sodium arsenate (AsV). These results support the contention that the heme saturation of trypotophan pyrrolase is sensitive to treatments that modify liver heme concn. The increase in heme oxygenase activity produced by arsenic appears to be mediated by a mechanism largely or entirely independent of heme. The main effects of continous exposure to sodium arsenite were an initial decrease in the heme saturation of trypotophan pyrrolase which remained constant during the period of treatment, and an initial increase in 5-aminolevulinate synthetase activity, which after ten days of exposure dropped somewhat but remained aboved control values."

Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), indicative of liver injury, was elevated in both arsenite and arsenate groups, and a high fat diet further increased these levels. Histopathology (H&E and Masson stain) showed that liver inflammation, steatosis (fatty liver), hepatocyte degeneration, and fibrosis occurred with arsenic alone, but their severity was markedly increased with the high fat diet. Total liver RNA was isolated for real-time RT-PCR analysis. Arsenic exposure increased the expression of inflammation genes, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS, chemokines, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. The expression of the stress-related gene heme oxygenase-1 was increased, while metallothionein-1 and GSH S-transferase-pi were decreased when arsenic was combined with the high fat diet. Expression of genes related to liver fibrosis, such as procollagen-1 and -3, SM-actin and TGF-beta, were synergistically increased in the arsenic plus high fat diet group. The expression of genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP9) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP1, TIMP2) was also enhanced, suggestive of early oncogenic events. In general, arsenite produced more pronounced effects than arsenate. In summary, chronic inorganic arsenic exposure in mice produces liver injury, and a high fat diet markedly increases arsenic-induced hepatofibrogenesis."

Inflammatory pain was assessed by using the formalin and tail-flick tests, while inflammation was evaluated with the carrageenan model. Arsenite did not induce pain or significant inflammation by itself. In contrast, arsenite in both single dose administration and subchronic exposure increased not only the inflammatory process and the underlying hyperalgesic pain, but also induced a decrease in the pain threshold. Alterations in pain processing were dependent on the arsenic dose and the length of exposure, and the underlying mechanism involved an increased release of local PGE(2). These results suggest that inorganic arsenic exposure enhances pain perception and exacerbates the pathological state of inflammatory diseases."

A significant wt loss of the ovary and uterus was also observed after this treatment, along with a prolonged diestrous phase and a high accumulation of arsenic in the plasma and these organs. Moreover, sodium arsenite was also responsible for ovarian follicular and uterine cell degeneration characterized by a high number of regressing follicles and a reduction in the uterine luminal diameter, respectively, in comparison with the controls. A dietary supplementation of sodium selenite at the dose of 0.6 mg/100 g bw/rat/day for a period of 28 days along with arsenic treatment minimized the gonadal wt loss significantly and increased the activities of the ovarian steroidogenic enzymes as well as the ovarian and uterine peroxidase at the control level. Selenium was also able to increase the plasma levels of LH, FSH, and estradiol toward the control level. Vaginal smears showed normal estrous cyclicity in sodium selenite-supplemented arsenic-treated rats along with lower arsenic levels in the plasma and gonadal tissue in comparison with arsenic-only-treated rats. Histological sections of ovary and uterine tissues in the control and experimental groups confirmed that sodium selenite supplementation was able to prevent arsenic-induced histopathological changes in the ovary and uterus. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the midbrain and diencephalon decreased significantly, whereas the serotonin level was increased significantly after 28 days of sodium arsenite treatment. All of these parameters were, in most cases, unchanged from the control level when sodium selenite was co-administered with sodium arsenite. Arsenic intoxication was also associated with increased liver weight and elevation in the activities of hepatic and renal acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminases, but selenium co-administration was not able to change these toxic effects of arsenic. The results ...  indicate the significant protective action of sodium selenite on arsenic-induced toxicity in the female reproductive system, while there was no significant protective effect of selenium on arsenic-induced toxicity in other organs."

To better understand the functional and morphological consequences of iAs exposure, ... the electrophysiological and histological characteristics of the sensory sural nerves /were examined/ in adult Male Wistar rats following 30 days of sodium arsenite administration by gavage (10 mg/kg bw/day). Arsenic (As) levels in the peripheral nerves of exposed animals were about 150 times greater than those in controls. Lipid peroxidation was also increased in iAs-exposed animals. Compound action potentials (CAPs) evoked in iAs-exposed nerves were characterized by a slower conduction velocity (approximately 26%). iAs-exposed nerves also showed a trend towards a decreased CAP area (approximately 35%). These electrophysiological changes were consistent with histological alterations such as an approximately 56% decrease in myelin thickness. In addition, the perimeter and transverse area of axons were reduced to 29% and 45% of control, respectively. The results suggest that accumulation of As produced by iAs exposure induces oxidative damage, severe demyelination, and other morphological alterations in axons of peripheral nerves. These changes may, in turn, induce changes in the generation and propagation of action potentials in peripheral nerves, leading to decreased transmission of information from peripheral sensory organs to the central nervous system."

Four weeks after initiation of arsenic treatment, TPA at a dose of 1.25 ug/200 uL acetone was applied twice a week for 2 weeks to the shaved dorsal skin of all mice, including the controls not receiving arsenic. In some cases arsenic exposure reduced body weight gain and caused mortality (including moribundity). Arsenical exposure resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of arsenic in the liver that was unexpectedly independent of chemical species and produced hepatic global DNA hypomethylation. cDNA microarray and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that all arsenicals altered the expression of numerous genes associated with toxicity and cancer. However, organic arsenicals [MMA(V) and DMA(V)] induced a pattern of gene expression dissimilar to that of inorganic arsenicals. In summary, subchronic exposure of Tg.AC mice to inorganic or organic arsenicals resulted in toxic manifestations, hepatic arsenic accumulation, global DNA hypomethylation, and numerous gene expression changes.

In C3H mice, two separate studies show male offspring exposed to arsenic in utero developed liver carcinoma and adrenal cortical adenoma in a dose-related fashion during adulthood. Prenatally exposed female C3H offspring show dose-related increases in ovarian tumors and lung carcinoma and in proliferative lesions (tumors plus preneoplastic hyperplasia) of the uterus and oviduct. In addition, prenatal arsenic plus postnatal exposure to the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in C3H mice produces excess lung tumors in both sexes and liver tumors in females. Male CD1 mice treated with arsenic in utero develop tumors of the liver and adrenal and renal hyperplasia while females develop tumors of urogenital system, ovary, uterus and adrenal and hyperplasia of the oviduct. Additional postnatal treatment with diethylstilbestrol or tamoxifen after prenatal arsenic in CD1 mice induces urinary bladder transitional cell proliferative lesions, including carcinoma and papilloma, and enhances the carcinogenic response in the liver of both sexes. Overall this model has provided convincing evidence that arsenic is a transplacental carcinogen in mice ... ."

The effect of chronic exposure to arsenic on liver damage caused by acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was determined in mice. Male C57Bl/6J mice (4-6 weeks) were exposed to arsenic (49 ppm as sodium arsenite in drinking water). After 7 months of exposure, animals were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg i.p.) and sacrificed 24 hr later. Arsenic alone caused no overt hepatotoxicity, as determined by plasma enzymes and histology. In contrast, arsenic exposure dramatically enhanced liver damage caused by LPS, increasing the number and size of necroinflammatory foci. This effect of arsenic was coupled with increases in indices of oxidative stress (4-HNE adducts, depletion of GSH and methionine pools). The number of apoptotic (TUNEL) hepatocytes was similar in the LPS and arsenic/LPS groups. In contrast, arsenic pre-exposure blunted the increase in proliferating (PCNA) hepatocytes caused by LPS; this change in the balance between cell death and proliferation was coupled with a robust loss of liver weight in the arsenic/LPS compared to the LPS alone group. The impairment of proliferation after LPS caused by arsenic was also coupled with alterations in the expression of key mediators of cell cycle progression (p27, p21, CDK6 and Cyclin D1). Taken together, these results suggest that arsenic, at doses that are not overtly hepatotoxic per se, significantly enhances LPS-induced liver injury..."

However, epididymal and accessory sex organ weight was similar to control. The activities of marker testicular enzymes such as sorbitol dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and 17beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) were significantly decreased, but those of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) were significantly increased. A decrease in sperm count and sperm motility, along with an increase in abnormal sperm, was observed in arsenite-exposed mice. A significant accumulation of arsenic in testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and prostate gland was observed in treated animals. Thus long term exposure (365 days) at the dose level of 53.39 uM/L sodium arsenite (4 ppm As), to which human beings are likely to be exposed via drinking water, may cause testicular and spermatotoxic effect."

Saline or sodium arsenite (6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously in Wistar-Kyoto rats for 4 hr. As compared to saline, arsenite significantly increased vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in both rat isolated aorta and renal arteries examined in tissue bath. This change was diminished after preincubation of the tissues with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, which increased phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction to a similar extent as arsenite. In contrast, acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, mediated by nitric oxide in the aorta and by an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in renal arteries, was not affected by arsenite. Arsenite induced expression of heat shock proteins Hsp72, Hsp32, and Hsp90, but endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression was not changed. The effects of arsenite on vasoreactivity were unlikely to be mediated by heat shock protein induction, because blockade of heat shock protein induction had little effect on the increased vasoconstriction in vessels from arsenite-treated animals. Our study suggests that in vivo arsenic treatment increases vasoconstrictor reactivity by compromising basal endothelial nitric oxide function, which is not caused by altered endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression."

Research indicates that NaAsO2 profoundly affects the distribution of arsenic within ladder brake plants, showcasing a notable increase in arsenic concentrations in various plant parts with rising water-soluble arsenic levels in the soil. Notably, this compound shows a marked impact on the aboveground biomass, especially in the fronds, when soil arsenic concentrations remain below 100 mg/kg. At these levels, the plant's ability to accumulate arsenic in its fronds corresponds directly to the arsenic concentration in the soil. However, when soil concentrations surpass 100 mg/kg, a decrease in arsenic accumulation in fronds occurs, potentially due to restricted upward translocation caused by toxic arsenic levels in the roots. This information suggests that sodium arsenite, at moderate concentrations, enables the passive uptake of arsenic by ladder brake, yet restricts its translocation to fronds at higher concentrations. Moreover, the systemic nature of sodium arsenite becomes apparent as it influences the phytoextraction capacity of ladder brake. The compound affects both the aboveground biomass and translocation factors, dictating the effectiveness of arsenic uptake and movement within the plant. Sodium arsenite's impact on the bioconcentration factor (BF) and translocation factor (TF) reveals its ability to enhance arsenic concentrations in ladder brake fronds, particularly at moderate soil arsenic levels. However, as soil arsenic concentrations increase, there's a decline in arsenic translocation from roots to fronds, suggesting a nuanced influence of sodium arsenite on the plant's ability to translocate arsenic depending on varying soil arsenic levels.",
