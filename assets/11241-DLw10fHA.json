Chemicals were tested up to toxic doses with and without exogenous metabolic activation. 3-Chloro-2-methyl-1-propene induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells at 16-200 ug/ml, both in the presence and absence of S9. In the absence of S9, in vitro treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with 120 ug/ml or more of this chemical also produced chromosomal aberrations; treatment results in the presence of S9 were questionable because the increases in aberrations occurred only in one trial at the highest nontoxic dose tested (200 ug/ml), and the aberrations were all observed as pulverized chromosomes."
