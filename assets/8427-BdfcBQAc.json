            "Value": "AEROBIC: Using a soil inoculum in a laboratory experiment, the time to complete disappearance under the influence of UV at 283 mu was greater than 205 days using concentrations of 50, 50, and 80 ppm dichlorprop added to 3 soils(1). Dichlorprop had half-lives of 10, 38, and 4 days in soil from Hole (sandy loam), Kroer (loam), and Froland (highly decomposed organic), Norway, respectively(2). Dichlorprop was not degraded in by soil bacterium after 28 days with a starting concn of 50 ug/mL and incubated at 30 \u00b0C(3). No degradation of dichlorprop was found after 45 days in Lanna clay(4). The half-life for the R and S isomers for dichlorprop in soil are reported as 8.7 and 4.4 days, respectively, and it degrades completely in 31 days with biological mediated degradation(5). The calculated half-lives of the R and S isomers of dichlorprop for 0-15 day incubation are 21.9 and 7.1 days, at 16-35 days incubation, 4.6 to 3.9 days, and for 52 days incubation, 6.0 and 6.8 days using garden soil at pH 7.0 and 1.6% organic carbon(6). Dichlorprop had a half-life of 5 days in soil from Vienna, Austria incubated at 21 \u00b0C for 32 days(7). Dichlorprop was shown to degrade rapidly in soil after a lag period; the lag period decreased with repeated application, and the degradation rate increased with increased pH(8). In soil, metabolism involves degradation of the side-chain to 2,4-dichlorophenol, ring hydroxylation, and subsequent ring opening(9). Dichlorprop was degraded in an aerobic aquatic study at 1.6 ug/L/day after a 31 day lag and at 2.0 ug/L/day after a 21 day lag period(10). Dichlorprop was degraded aerobically after acclimation in a sandy aquifer in 5 months(11). Dichlorprop was rapidly degraded in 14 days in an aerobic limestone aquifer after a 4 day lag period(12). Dichlorprop was microbially degraded in Danish aquifers in 124 days with a lag time of at least 62 days(13)."

Koc values of 113 and 118 were determined in soils at respective pHs of 4.4 and 4.1(1). Koc values have also been measured as 34-129(2) and 36.6-60(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that dichlorprop is expected to have very high to high mobility in soil. The pKa of dichlorprop is 3.1(5), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(6). Dichlorprop has a pesticide leaching potential of 49 when used as a foliar applicant(7)."
