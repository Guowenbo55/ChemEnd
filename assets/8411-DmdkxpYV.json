At low levels of yeast extract, 3,3'-dimethyoxybenzidine showed no consistent degradation in an OECD AFNOR sewage die-away test and it was not classified as readily biodegradable; only high levels of yeast extract (100-200 mg/l) enchanced the biodegradation of this compound(2). 3,3'-Dimethyoxybenzidine at 35 \u00b0C and an initial concn of 100 mg/l in the presence of an anaerobic sludge inoculum degraded 100% in 42 days(3)."

            "Value": "The Koc of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine is estimated as 230(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 1.81(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil(SRC). The first pKa of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine is estimated as 4.2(SRC), using an estimation method based on perturbed molecular orbital theory and linear free energy (LFER) methods(4). This estimated pKa indicates that 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine will partially exist in the protonated form under acidic conditions and cations have greater adsorption to soils than neutral molecules(SRC). Furthermore, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine is an aromatic amine which may form covalent bonds with humic materials resulting in relatively immobile quinone-like complexes(5)."
