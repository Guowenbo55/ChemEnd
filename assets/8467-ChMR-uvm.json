            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ Groups of CD Sprague-Dawley BR rats (20/sex/group) were fed ethyl vanillin of > 99.9% purity (nature of diet e.g., semi-synthetic/chow diet, not specified) at dose levels of 0, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw/day for 13 weeks. ... No clinical signs or treatment-related deaths of toxicological significance were observed in treated animals during the study. Food intake was statistically significantly reduced in females at the highest dose group at week 1, and in treated male groups at weeks 1-4; thereafter there were no significant differences in food intake between controls and treated animals. Water intake, measured accurately during week 12 of treatment, did not differ notably from controls. Body-weight gain in males and females in the high-dose group was significantly reduced compared to control throughout the study.... There were no treatment-related differences from control in hematological parameters at week 6 or at termination. Clinical biochemical analyses showed statistically significant higher values in the high-dose group compared to control for ALAT, ALP, cholesterol and total plasma protein. Cholesterol levels were significantly increased  in males at the intermediate-dose group at week 6 only. The authors considered the alteration of the clinical biochemical parameters secondary to the hepatic changes seen histologically. Other sporadic differences from control values were generally within normal ranges for the strain and were not considered of toxicological significance.  At autopsy, enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted in males at the intermediate-dose group, and in both sexes at the highest dose group. In addition, there was a reduction in adipose tissue in rats of both sexes at the highest dose group. Absolute liver weights were similar to controls but relative liver weights were increased in the intermediate- and high-dose animals. Absolute and relative spleen weights were increased in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. Although relative spleen weights were increased in the low-dose males, the absolute organ weights were unaffected, and in the absence of histopathological changes this observation was considered by the authors to be of no toxicological significance.  Histological examination revealed a dose-related increased incidence of hepatic peribiliary inflammatory change in both males and females of the intermediate- and high-dose groups, and minor bile duct hyperplasia affecting 1/20 intermediate- and 4/20 high-dose males. There were no changes observed in the liver parenchyma and no degenerative or inflammatory changes of the bile duct epithelium. Increased white pulp cellularity and prominence of germinal centres in the spleen, and increased prominence of germinal centres and lymphoid proliferation in cervical lymph nodes were seen in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. The authors considered the findings of the lymphoid tissue to be associated reactive changes to the hepatic peribiliary inflammatory observations."

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the impact of vanillin and ethyl vanillin ... on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP3A and CYP2E1 in rat liver microsomes (RLM) in vivo. ...

Anti-inflammatory activity of EVA was convinced using the two in vivo models, such as vascular permeability and air pouch models in mice. Antinociceptive activity of EVA was assessed using acetic acid-induced writhing model in mice. EVA suppressed production of nitric oxide and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. However, EVA could not suppress induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in the LPS-activated macrophages. EVA diminished reactive oxygen species level in the LPS-activated macrophages. EVA also suppressed enhanced matrix metalloproteinase-9 gelatinolytic activity in the LPSactivated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. EVA at the used concentrations couldn't diminish viability of the macrophage cells. Taken together, the anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties of EVA are based on its suppressive effect on the production of nitric oxide possibly via decreasing the reactive oxygen species level."

Thermal tolerance during rehydration and survival in reconstituted PIF were influenced by compound type, concentration, and temperature.
