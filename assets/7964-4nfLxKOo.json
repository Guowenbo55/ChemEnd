A BCF of 41 was measured in bluegill fish (Lepomis macrochirus) over a 14-day exposure period(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from low to high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Dissolved organic matter that is present in interstitial water may greatly reduce the amount of a chemical that is available for accumulation(5). In one set of experiments, midge larvae were found to accumulate higher tissue-to-sediment ratios of chlorobenzene from a low-organic content sediment than from a high-organic content sediment(5). BCFs of 0.25 (from sediment), 11 (from interstitial water), and 10 (overlying water) were measured for midge larvae exposed to chlorobenzene under equilibrium exposure conditions(5).

Occupational studies have shown that acute and chronic exposure to chlorobenzene can cause irritation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. Using in vitro assays, /it was/ shown in a previous study that human bronchial epithelial cells release inflammatory mediators such as the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in response to chlorobenzene. This response is mediated through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here, /researchers/ investigated the effects of monochlorobenzene on human lung cells, with emphasis on potential alterations of the redox equilibrium to clarify whether the chlorobenzene-induced inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells is caused via an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. /It was/ found that expression of cellular markers for oxidative stress, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase pi1 (GSTP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), were elevated in the presence of monochlorobenzene. Likewise, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in response to exposure. However, in the presence of the antioxidants N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) or bucillamine, chlorobenzene-induced upregulation of marker proteins and release of the inflammatory mediator MCP-1 are suppressed. These results complement /the authors/ previous findings and point to an oxidative stress-mediated inflammatory response following chlorobenzene exposure."

To characterize the underlying mechanisms ... the influence of chlorobenzene on the activation of two intracellular signalling pathways: the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways /were investigated/. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB or the p38 MAP kinase and exposed to chlorobenzene using an air-liquid cell culture system. Exposure of lung epithelial cells to chlorobenzene resulted in an activation of NF-kappa B and p38 MAP kinase and a release of the chemokine MCP-1. In the presence of IKK-NBD, a specific NF-kappa B inhibitor, or the inhibitors of the p38 MAP kinase SB 203580 and SB 202190, the chlorobenzene-related MCP-1 release was suppressed, suggesting an involvement of both pathways in the chlorobenzene induced expression of MCP-1. /These/ data show that the release of MCP-1 following chlorobenzene exposure is dependent on the NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways."

The extent of in vivo enzymatic activation of brominated compounds was higher than that of chlorinated chemicals. Aryl halides were bound mainly to liver DNA whereas interaction of alkyl halides with DNA of liver, kidney, and lung gave rise to similar binding extent. In vitro activation of all chemicals was mediated by microsomal p450-dependent mixed function oxidase system present in rat and mouse liver and, in smaller amount, in mouse lung. Activation of alkyl halides by liver cytosolic GSH-trasferases even occurred. The relative reactivity of chemicals in vivo, expressed as covalent binding index to rat liver DNA, was: 1,2-dibromoethane > bromobenzene > 1,2-dichloroethane > chlorobenzene > epichlorohydrin > benzene.

In F1 litters, pup and litter survival for treated groups were comparable to controls. In F2 litters, a slight decrease in pup survival index was observed at the high concentration level only, but this was attributable to excessive mortality in the litters of two dams. Significant increase in mean absolute or relative liver weight occurred in the F0 and F1 generations in the 150 ppm and 450 ppm groups. Increased incidence of small flaccid testes and dilated renal pelvis occurred in the 450 ppm group for both F0 and F1 adults.

Embryos were reared in the presence of the agents for 48 hr, from the zygote to the pluteus larval stage. In addition, sperm inactivation was tested by adding agents to sperm suspensions, which were then used to inseminate untreated eggs. Benzene treatment at 10(-6) molar (M) showed a significant increase in embryo developmental defects and an elevated metaphase to anaphase ratio indicating partial metaphase block, but no increase in total mitotic aberrations. With chlorobenzene, developmental defects were only increased above controls at 10(-4)M. Chlorobenzene increased the metaphase to anaphase ratio, and the percentage of anaphase aberrations increased significantly with 10(-5) and 10(-4)M. A dose related response was found for o-dichlorobenzene in developmental defects and for metaphase to anaphase ratio increases. For m-dichlorobenzene, developmental defects and mitotic abnormalities were strongly increased. Sperm inactivation tests produced entirely differently results. Only o-dichlorobenzene and p-dichlorobenzene caused spermiotoxicity. Developmental defects in the offspring of pretreated sperm were significant for all compounds, but primarily for benzene and chlorobenzene. However, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene caused clear inhibition of mitosis. Total mitotic aberrations increased with benzene, m-dichlorobenzene, and p-dichlorobenzene, for anaphase aberrations the greatest effect was observed for chlorobenzene, with lesser effects for m-dichlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and benzene. Both chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene caused a sharp decrease in active mitotic figures and in anaphase figures (increased metaphase to anaphase), so that the lack of increase in total mitotic aberration did not necessarily reflect the absence of any effect."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ The DNA damaging effect of chlorobenzene was investigated in peripheral lymphocytes and bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 female mice using a gel electrophoresis assay for DNA from single cells (the single cell gel electrophoresis assay) under alkaline conditions. The effect of chlorobenzene was studied both after single and repeated intraperitoneal injections of 750 mg/kg body weight. The cytostatic agent cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg, ip) was used as a reference substance, and vehicle-treated mice as controls. DNA damage was recorded 16 hr after the (last) injection, using an automated computerized image analysis system specifically designed for the single cell gel electrophoresis assay. There was evidence of chlorobenzene-induced DNA damage after 3 days of repeated exposure in peripheral lymphocytes, but no indications of such an effect in bone marrow cells. Cyclophosphamide induced significant damage to DNA both in bone marrow cells and lymphocytes, the effect being most pronounced in the latter cells. It is concluded that high-dose exposure to chlorobenzene is associated with genotoxicity to peripheral lymphocytes. However, this solvent is apparently not a major hazard to bone marrow cells, even after repeated high-dose exposure."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ The cytotoxicity of monochlorobenzene (MCB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene was examined using precision cut rat liver slices obtained from male Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rats. The liver slices were maintained in dynamic organ culture for up to 6 hr and cytotoxicity was evaluated by intracellular K+ content and protein synthesis. A concentration related injury was observed when liver slices from Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with the chlorobenzene isomers at concentrations greater than 1 mM. At 2 mM the degree of toxicity produced was dependent on the particular isomer studied with 1,3-dichlorobenzene showing the earliest onset of toxicity (3 hr) followed by 1,2-dichlorobenzene then 1,4-dichlorobenzene (6 hr). At 5 mM the degree of toxicity produced by any of the three dichlorobenzene isomers was not different. MCB, which was not toxic to the slices at 1 or 2 mM, was toxic at 5 mM (6 hr). A significant potentiation of dichlorobenzene toxicity was observed with liver slices prepared from phenobarbital induced Sprague-Dawley rats. This potentiation resulted in the expression of toxicity at either lower concentrations (1 mM for 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 2 mM). In addition, the toxicity of MCB (5 mM) was slightly increased in slices from phenobarbital-induced rats. When Fischer 344 rats slices were incubated with the chlorobenzenes, there was an increase in cytotoxicity and a change in the rank order of toxicity (1,2-dichlorobenzene > 1,3-dichlorobenzene > 1,4-dichlorobenzene > MCB). 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,3-dichlorobenzene (1 mM) were toxic in non-induced Fischer 344 rat slices but not toxic in non-induced Sprague-Dawley rat liver, slices. The 1,3-dichlorobenzene isomer was most toxic in Sprague-Dawley rats while 1,2-dichlorobenzene was the most toxic in Fischer 344 rats. Therefore, precision cut rat liver slicing can be used to not only distinguish the rank order of toxicant potency between chemical isomers, but also the effects of strain differences and the role of biotransformation enzyme induction."

An ip dose of 9.8 mmol/kg chlorobenzene in rats produced evidence of liver toxicity over a 72 hr time course. Plasma alanine aminotransferase activity and morphological evidence of damage were maximized about 48 hr after dosing. Maximal covalent binding to liver protein (3.07 nmol/mg) had occurred by 24 hr and approximately 36% of the administered dose had appeared in the urine by 48 hr. Liver and plasma chlorobenzene concn were proportionally increased over the dosage range 2-14.7 mmol/kg but marked centrilobular necrosis and alanine aminotransferase activity elevations were seen only at the two highest doses (9.8 and 14.7 mmol/kg). Overall, doses depressed hepatic glutathione /levels/ (GSH) to between 30 and 40% of control by 4 hr. Evidence of rapid recovery was evident at 2.0 and 4.9 mmol/kg but glutathione levels remained low through 8 hr after /administration of the/ 9.8 or 14.7 mmol/kg /doses/. Liver body weight ratios were increased to a similar extent at all dosages when measured 24 hr post-treatment. Urinary excretion ranged from 59% at the low dosage to only 19% at the highest dosage, by 24 hr. Dose related covalent binding to liver protein at 24 hr occurred up to 9.8 mmol/kg /however/ the binding associated with 14.7 mmol/kg was equivalent /only/ to that seen with the 4.9 mmol/kg dosage (1.6 nmol/mg protein)."
