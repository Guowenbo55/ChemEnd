In a closed system using fresh soil at 15 \u00b0C, a mean half-life of 52 days was measured for 1,2-dichloropropane as opposed to mean half-lives of 26, 13, and 8, respectively(1). 1,2-Dichloropropane is reported to be degraded during biological treatment provided suitable acclimation is achieved(2,5). However, in a bench scale continuous flow activated sludge reactor with an 8 hr retention time, 1,2-dichloropropane was entirely removed by stripping(3). It was reported to be degradation resistant in a 2 week screening test that utilizes a mixed inoculum of soil, surface water and sludge(4). 42% degradation was achieved in 7 days when incubated with sewage seed(6). There was evidence of only slight biodegradation in 20 weeks (as evidenced by 5% of the radioactivity remaining unextracted from a medium loam soil) and it was stable in a sandy loam soil for 12 weeks when incubated in a closed container(7). No volatile degradation products were detected from treated soil(7). 1,2-Dichloropropane, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(8)."

            "Value": "The Koc for 1,2-dichloropropane is 47 in a silt loam(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that 1,2-dichloropropane is expected to have high mobility in soil. It sorbs to clay minerals in dry soil but desorbs as the soil absorbs moisture(2). In the areas of the US where 1,2-dichloropropane was used as a fumigant, the soil is generally sandy with low organic carbon content and would probably have little impact on reducing mobility due to soil adsorption(2)."
