            "content": "The study found that broadleaf signalgrass is sensitive to nicosulfuron but resistant to primisulfuron, while corn is resistant to both herbicides. The research aimed to determine the effect of varying light levels and air temperatures on the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of nicosulfuron and primisulfuron in broadleaf signalgrass and corn. Corn absorbed between 60% and 85% of the applied nicosulfuron and primisulfuron within 72 hours after treatment (HAT), depending on the environmental conditions. Absorption, translocation, and metabolism were all more rapid at higher temperatures and light intensities. Translocation of both herbicides out of the treated leaf in corn was less than 4.5% of the herbicide absorbed through 72 HAT. Corn rapidly metabolized both herbicides, with primisulfuron being metabolized more rapidly than nicosulfuron. Broadleaf signalgrass absorbed 20% more nicosulfuron than primisulfuron through 72 HAT. Nicosulfuron translocation out of the treated leaf in broadleaf signalgrass was less than 15% of the absorbed herbicide through 72 HAT, while primisulfuron translocation was about 40% during the same period. Primisulfuron metabolism was more rapid than nicosulfuron in broadleaf signalgrass.",
