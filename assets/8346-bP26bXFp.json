However, in a 33-day model ecosystem, mosquito fish placed in the system on day 30 had a BCF of 9400. This discrepancy in the BCF for the 33 and 3 day ecosystem is most likely due to the fact that a final water concentration in the 33 day experiment was used in determining bioconcentration and due to the degradation of the di-n-octyl phthalate, this water concentration was low(1). According to a classification scheme(2), these BCFs suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high(SRC). Bioaccumulation factors of 28,500 and 6800 were determined in the algae, Oedogonium cardiacum, after 33 and 3 days exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate, respectively(3). Bioaccumulation factors of 2600 and 9300 were measured in brine shrimp after 33 and 3 days exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate, respectively(3). A BCF of 1606 was measured in algae exposed to di-n-octyl phthalate in a model waste stabilization pond(4).

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Di-n-octyl phthalate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 67% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(1). Di-n-octyl phthalate was degraded 92-94% in 7 days in a static degradation test utilizing a sewage seed that had been subcultured three times(2). In a model terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem, di-n-octyl phthalate was rapidly degraded by organisms in the system, having a half-life of 5 days(3). The degradation products of di-n-octyl phthalate are the monoester and phthalic acid(3); hydrolysis is believed to be accomplished by specific esterases only(4). Respirometric measurements of soil amended with di-n-octyl phthalate shows that when acclimated, there is some microbial utilization, although this is marginal at 4 and 10 \u00b0C(4). When subjected to high-rate composting in an artificial compost mixture, 69% and 92% were removed after 7 and 30 days, respectively(5). Di-n-octyl phthalate was degraded 68.8% in model waste stabilization ponds(6). Di-n-octyl phthalate was biodegraded 85% after 10 days incubation in Rhine river water at 20 \u00b0C; at 4 \u00b0C, biodegradation was negligible(7). Di-n-octyl phthalate was biodegraded 61% in 42 days and 83% in 63 days in sandy soil and sandy soil mixed with gravel/till taken from a plasticizer manufacturing site(8). Di-n-octyl phthalate, at a starting concentration of 10-100 mg/L, had a half-life of 498.6 hours in acclimated activated sludge(9)."
