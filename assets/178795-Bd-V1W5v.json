The percentage of 14C-glyphosate and 14C-quizalofop in the leafwash and in the treated leaf did not differ among biotypes, but differences occurred for the translocation to the underground parts. The partitioning of the 14C-glyphosate and 14C-quizalofop in the treated crown, other crowns, propagating rhizomes, and other rhizomes differed among biotypes. On a disintegration per minute (DPM) mg-1 basis, differences among biotypes were found with 14C-glyphosate but much less with 14C-quizalofop. Metabolism of 14C-quizalofop in the treated leaf was similar in the two biotypes tested except for the percentage of polar metabolites 1 d after treatment. The percentage of 14C-quizalofop available for translocation was the same in both biotypes.",

Translocation of radioactivity in the different plant parts varied among biotypes. Translocation in the whole plant after treatment with the three 14C-chemicals varied among biotypes but was not correlated with their tolerance to herbicides. Detailed analysis of distribution of radioactivity in the primary rhizome showed that more 14C was found in the apical sections after treatment with 14C-sucrose. A similar pattern was observed after 14C-glyphosate application with all biotypes except one. Very low radioactivity was found in rhizomes after 14C-quizalofop application, but a preferential accumulation in apical sections of the primary rhizome was detected in two biotypes. The tolerance of one biotype to glyphosate was explained by the absence of radioactivity accumulation in the apical sections of the rhizome.",

Haloxyfop was the only herbicide where recovery decreased between the 3-and 48-h interval. All plants absorbed more of the herbicide at the 48-h interval than at the 3- or 6-h interval under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. Increased drought stress caused more acropetal movement with fluazifop and sethoxydim and less acropetal movement with quizalofop at the 3-h interval. Basipetal transloation, although different among herbicides, responded similarly to imposed moisture stress, which decreased basipetal translocation approximately 19%.",
