Aldehydes studied included isovaleraldehyde. Mice were exposed to test atmospheres in a 2.7 liter head only exposure chamber for 10 minutes. Sensory irritation was quantified by measuring respiratory rate depression before, during, and after exposure. Five concentrations of each aldehyde were used to construct a concentration response curve, and the concentration eliciting a 50% decrease in respiratory rate (RD50) value was determined. Unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes produced RD50 values ranging from 1 to 5 ppm, cyclic aldehydes produced RD50 values ranging from 60 to 400 ppm, and saturated aliphatic aldehydes produced RD50 values ranging from 750 to 4200 ppm. Alpha, beta unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes were about two orders of magnitude more potent than saturated aliphatic aldehydes, and cyclic aldehydes were one order of magnitude more potent than saturated aliphatic aldehydes. No statistically significant differences in response were found between the two strains of mice."
