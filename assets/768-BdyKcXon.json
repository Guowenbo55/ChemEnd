            "Value": "Cyanide (as hydrogen cyanide), originating in vivo by dissociation of potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide, and other cyanogenic compounds or arising from catabolism of cyanogenic glycosides, exerts its acute toxic effects by complexing with the ferric iron atom in metalloenzymes, resulting in histotoxic anoxia through inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, metalloenzymes that function as the terminal oxidase of the inner mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain. A two-step process has been proposed: cyanide as hydrogen cyanide first penetrates a protein crevice of cytochrome c oxidase and binds to the protein. Hydrogen cyanide then binds to the trivalent iron ion of the enzyme, forming a relatively stable (but reversible) coordination complex. One mole of hydrogen cyanide is bound to one mole of cytochrome c oxidase. As a result, the enzyme becomes unable to catalyze the reactions in which electrons would be transferred from reduced cytochrome to oxygen. Cellular oxygen utilization is thus impaired, with resultant reduction in or cessation of aerobic metabolism. Glucose catabolism then shifts from the aerobic pathway to anaerobic metabolism including the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in increased blood glucose, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) levels, and a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) ratio. /Some investigators/ suggest that it is the binding of cyanide to oxidized CuB, the copper ion that is part of the dioxygen binding-site that leads to the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. The inhibition of oxygen use by cells (termed histoxic hypoxia) causes oxygen tensions to rise in peripheral tissues. This results in a decrease in the unloading gradient for oxyhemoglobin; thus, oxyhemoglobin is carried in the venous blood. Inhibition of oxygen utilization is thought to occur rapidly after cyanide exposure. ...  In addition to binding to cytochrome c oxidase, cyanide also binds to catalase, peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and succinic dehydrogenase. These reactions may also contribute to the classic signs of cyanide toxicity. ..."

The peculiarity of this enzyme is its sulfur linkages which are of the persulfide or sulfane type, favoring a \"labile sulfur\" condition that is essential for activity. Cyanide is a strong thiophile reacting with the \"labile\" sulfur thus breaking the persulfide bond."

The mechanisms of incapacitation in monkeys exposed to the pyrolysis products of polyacrylonitrile were compared to those resulting from low level hydrogen cyanide gas exposures. The physiological effects of the polyacrylonitrile atmospheres were almost identical to those of hydrogen cyanide gas alone. They consisted of hyperventilation, followed by loss of consciousness after 1-5 min, bradycardia with arrhythmias and T-wave abnormalities, and were followed by a rapid recovery after exposure. Hydrogen cyanide is considered to be the major toxic product formed by the pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile.

Hypothetically, any combination of concentration and time that yields the same \"toxic load\" will give a constant biological response. These formulas have been developed and tested using controlled, constant concentration animal studies, but the validity of applying these assumptions to time-varying concentration profiles has not been tested. Experiments were designed to test the validity of the model under conditions of non-constant acute exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats inhaled constant or pulsed concentrations of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) generated in a nose-only exposure system for 5, 15, or 30 min. The observed lethality of HCN for the 11 different C versus t profiles was used to evaluate the ability of the model to adequately describe the lethality of HCN under the conditions of non-constant inhalation exposure.

Experiments were performed with endothelium-intact rings prepared from bovine intrapulmonary artery. Methylene blue, a good inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, antagonized both arterial relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation in response to sodium nitroprusside, glyceryl trinitrate, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and acetylcholine. In contrast, cyanide inhibited only the responses to sodium nitroprusside. ... Contractile responses to phenylephrine, potassium, and U46619 were potentiated by methylene blue but not by cyanide. Cyanide does not share the properties of methylene blue as an inhibitor of arterial relaxation elicited by vasodilators that stimulate cyclic GMP formation."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ The four gases, nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) all readily inhibit oxygen consumption by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. This inhibition is responsible for much of their toxicity when they are applied externally to the body. However, recently these gases have all been implicated, to greater or lesser extents, in normal cellular signalling events. In this review we analyse the chemistry of this inhibition, comparing and contrasting mechanism and discussing physiological consequences. The inhibition by NO and CO is dependent on oxygen concentration, but that of HCN and H(2)S is not. NO and H(2)S are readily metabolized by oxidative processes within cytochrome oxidase. In these cases the enzyme may act as a physiological detoxifier of these gases. CO oxidation is much slower and unlikely to be as physiologically important. The evidence for normal physiological levels of these gases interacting with cytochrome oxidase is equivocal, in part because there is little robust data about their steady state concentrations. A reasonable case can be made for NO, and perhaps CO and H(2)S, inhibiting cytochrome oxidase in vivo, but endogenous levels of HCN seem unlikely to be high enough."

Other groups were exposed to HCN in air or in air + carbon monoxide. Some of the HCN exposed groups were presented with a chlorpromazine/thiosulfate combination protective against cyanide toxicity. Exposure to HCN without protective pretreatment was associated with mild cardiotoxicity as measured by the magnitude of release of cardiac-specific creatine phosphokinase activity and by the number of ectopic heart beats induced by norepinephrine injection. Much of the difference in the cardiotoxicities of polyurethane and hemlock smokes could be related to their different contents of HCN. However, the prevalence of focal histopathological lesions in the rat hearts did not correlate well with the other 2 measures of cardiotoxicity."

            "Value": "Hydrogen cyanide is only weakly absorbed by organic matter(1). Hydrogen cyanide is not strongly partitioned into the sediments or suspended adsorbents, primarily due to its high solubility in water. Cyanide mobility is least where soils exhibit low pH, high concn of free iron oxides, and positively charged particles (eg, kaolin, chlorite, gibbsite). Mobility is greatest at high pH, high concentration of free calcium carbonate (high negative charge) and low clay content. Adsorption of hydrogen cyanide by montmorillonitic clays is fairly weak and is decreased by the presence of water(2)."
