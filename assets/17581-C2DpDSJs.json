About 90% of the residual activity recovered from the soil after this period was the parent chloroneb(1). Half-lives of 10 to 180 days have been reported in soil(2). Chloroneb was added to samples of Chalmers silty clay loam soil (at 5.7 ug/g), Kentucky blue grass thatch(at 8.0 ug/g), and Kentucky blue grass clippings(at 8.0 ug/g) and incubated at 25 \u00b0C at a constant moisture (26, 76, and 75%, respectively)(3). Half-lives of 2.7, 8.7, and 69.3 days were reported for the soil, thatch, and grass clipping samples, respectively, when chloroneb was added as a single compound(3). Half-lives of 4.3, 8.7, and 69.3 days were reported for the soil, thatch, and grass clipping samples, respectively, when chloroneb was added as a mixture with triadimefon and vinclozolin(3)."

In a soil TLC plate study using Hagerstown silty clay loam soil (pH 6.8, 2.5% organic matter, 39.5% clay), chloroneb was immobile(6). In a field study, chloroneb was incorporated into a Keystone silt loam to a depth of 2 to 3 inches. After 6 months, nearly all of the chloroneb remained in the treated layer of soil(7)."

            "Value": "Two systemic fungicides, carboxin (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide) and chloroneb (1,4-dichloro-2,5-dimethoxy-benzene), were assessed in vitro, in the glasshouse, and in the field for their efficacy against sugarbeet root rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii. In vitro tests showed that carboxin and chloroneb significantly inhibited fungal growth at concentrations of 1 and 10 \u03bcg/g, respectively, and completely prevented sclerotia formation. Bioassays using extracts from sugarbeet seedlings treated with carboxin and chloroneb demonstrated the translocation of these compounds from the roots to the leaves. Greenhouse studies using soil treated with the fungicides exhibited systemic protection of seedlings against S. rolfsii infection for a minimum of 20 days, with increased protection observed at higher fungicide concentrations. Field studies further confirmed that ridge-soil drenching with carboxin and chloroneb, at rates of 2 and 15 kg/3000 liters of water/hectare, respectively, significantly reduced Sclerotium root rot and increased crop yields."
