The fungicide shows efficacy against powdery mildew, significantly reducing disease severity in treated plants. The systemic movement of isopyrazam from roots to cotyledons and leaves is observed, particularly at higher concentrations, enhancing its efficacy in controlling powdery mildew. Isopyrazam's systemic translocation from roots to leaves highlights its potential to be absorbed by cucumber roots, subsequently aiding in the management of foliar diseases, emphasizing its systemic nature within the plant's vascular system. This systemic movement contributes to the extended duration of activity against cucumber powdery mildew, demonstrating its effectiveness over an extended period compared to other fungicides currently used.",
