In a screening study, diethylamine at 10 ppm degraded with both an activated sludge and freshwater/sediment inoculum, 59 and 38% of the Theoretical BOD was obtained after 12 days of incubation, respectively(2). Inhibition was noted at moderate concentrations and sizeable reductions in BOD were noted at 50 ppm(2). Diethylamine was degraded slowly by activated sludge even when acclimatized (53% of Theoretical BOD was achieved after 13 days)(3). However the concentration levels used in this study could not be ascertained. When added to stream water, the maximum rate of biodegradation of diethylamine was proportional to an initial amine concentration over a concentration range from several nanograms to several milligrams per liter(4). At the highest concentration studied, 10 mg/L, the half-life of diethylamine was 0.9 days(4)."

At 100 ppm, lungs contained cellular infiltration and bronchopneumonia; livers had parenchymatous degeneration with evidence of cell regeneration; and kidneys showed nephritis.

Scheduled sacrifices were performed following 30, 60, and 120 days of exposure. During the first 2 weeks of exposure, the rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA did not gain weight. After 2 weeks, however, the rate of weight gain of these rats was greater than that of controls. Nevertheless, mean body weights for both sexes of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA remained depressed compared to controls throughout the study. Sneezing, tearing, and reddened noses were seen in rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA. Histopathologic examinations revealed lesions of the nasal mucosa of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA (rats exposed at 25 ppm were not evaluated). These lesions of the respiratory epithelium consisted of squamous metaplasia, suppurative rhinitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia. There were no pronounced treatment-related effects on organ weights, hematology, or clinical chemistry indices except for blood urea nitrogen which was evaluated in rats of both sexes exposed at 250 ppm DEA for 24 weeks. In contrast to the high-dose animals, no treatment-related effects were observed in rats intermittently exposed at 25 ppm DEA for up to 24 weeks. No evidence of cardiotoxicity was seen in rats exposed to either DEA concentration for up to 24 weeks."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Isolated individual fertilized eggs from zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) developed in vitro can be used to elucidate possible actions of hazardous agents on embryogenesis. This non-mammalian test system is easy to handle and allows one to obtain reproducible results within 4-6 days. In the present study, the following were the most important indicators of development at different stages during hatching that were checked: epiboly, yolk clot on primitive mouth (stage (st): 16), irregular muscle movement (st: 20), tail bud separation from the yolk (st: 20), heart beats: 200/min (st: 24), hatching of the embryo (st: 25), 34 somites (st: 25), delay of development. Normal development of each parameter (as %) was plotted against the concentrations of each agent applied in the incubation media (0.2 - 15 mg/mL), and the areas under the curves (AUC, 10(-2) x mg/mL) were calculated. The AUCs of dimethylformamide (DMF) were compared to those of N-methylformamide (NMF) and formamide (FA). Epiboly, muscle movement, and hatching of the embryo were more disturbed by DMF than by NMF or FA. Changes of the other parameters (yolk clot on primitive mouth, tail bud separation from the yolk, heart beats: 200/min, 34 somites, delay of development) were more pronounced after application of NMF than of DMF or FA. In total, the order of activity was: NMF greater than DMF greater than FA. Methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), and diethylamine (DEA), 0.1 - 5 mg/mL incubation media (neutralized by HCl to pH 7.5), caused mortality of most of eggs by cytotoxic effects essentially at stage 24. Malformations were not observed. The order of activity was: DEA greater than MA greater than DMA: this has been shown by the rates of embryonic mortality: DEA - 60% at 0.5 mg/mL, MA - 60% at 2 mg/mL, DMA - 40% at 2 mg/mL incubation media. The results show that the fish egg model allows the researcher to easily differentiate types of embryogenesis lesions caused by chemicals."

The time and magnitude of peak liver injury were assessed by histopathological examination of liver specimens taken at intervals after dosing. Serum enzymes were measured at the same intervals. Serum ornithine carbamyl transferase (SOCT) activity increased at least 6-fold in animals that showed liver damage by histopathology, and fell again as the injuries resolved. Measurements of other enzymes were less sensitive. SOCT measurements appear to be as sensitive a method as histopathology for detecting liver damage caused by administering xenobiotics. Since serum enzyme measurements do not require that the animals be sacrificed, they can be used for repeated examinations of the same animals, thus increasing the likelihood of detecting transient injury."
