            "Value": "The Koc of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene has been measured at a range of 501-1,445(1-4). According to a classification scheme(5), this Koc range suggests that 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is expected to have low mobility in soil. 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene was detected in soil leachate samples following the addition of crude oil to the surface of a soil trough filled with sand(6)."
