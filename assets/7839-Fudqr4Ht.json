In three day die-away tests using Japanese river and seawater, ethylene dibromide was observed to have moderate degradation (21-35% degradation)(2). Low concentrations of ethylene dibromide (<100 ug/L) were biotransformed completely within 2 weeks by a reductive dehalogenation under methanogenic conditions in a continuous-flow column(3); sterile controls showed that some abiotic degradation was also occurring, but microbial degradation was dominant(3). In a microcosm study simulating methanogenic conditions found in aquifer material, ethylene dibromide was found to biodegrade relatively rapidly(4); after 16 weeks of incubation, greater than 99% of initial ethylene dibromide was transformed(4); in sterile controls, only 20% was transformed after 40 weeks(4). Biodegradation of low concentrations of ethylene dibromide in groundwater microcosms was enhanced by addition of phenol(5)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Microbial degradation of ethylene dibromide was examined in microcosms using shallow aquifer material and groundwater(1); ethylene dibromide degraded aerobically in all samples with half-lives ranging from 35-350 days(1); degradation in autoclaved controls was very small in comparison to non-sterile tests(1). A review of available biodegradation data pertaining to ethylene bromide concluded that ethylene dibromide is biotransformed fairly readily in the environment(2); lifetimes can be as short as several days in surface soils and as long as many months in aquifer materials(2). In about two months, ethylene dibromide was converted almost completely and quantitatively to ethylene in a soil culture at an initial concentration of 188 g/L ethylene dibromide(3). Disappearance in soil at 100 mg/kg and 20 \u00b0C under aerobic laboratory conditions: half-life =< 2.0 days(3). Ethylene dibromide, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test; however, degradation determination was affected by major removal via volatilization(4). Using a closed-bottle protocol with a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum, ethylene dibromide (at 15 mg/L) was found to be not readily biodegradable with only 4.2% degradation after 28 days of incubation(5)."

Weekly semen samples (for 6 weeks preexposure, during treatment, and 12 weeks postdosing [pd]) were analyzed for sperm concentration, number, morphology, viability, and motion parameters (velocity, linearity, beat cross-frequency, amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and circularity), and semen pH, osmolality, volume, fructose, citric acid, carnitine, protein, and acid phosphatase (AP). Male fertility was assessed preexposure and at 4 and 12 weeks pd by artificial insemination of three females/male/time point with one million motile sperm. The percentage pregnant females, litter size, fetal body weights, and structural development were assessed. In the 45 mg/kg dose group of males there was 30% mortality and liver damage in 43% of the survivors as evidenced by increased levels of serum enzymes. Also in this group, ethylene dibromide produced significant decreases in sperm velocity, percentage motility, and amplitude of lateral head displacement (up to 25% at various times pd). There were also dose-related decreases in semen pH (up to 2%) and total ejaculate volume (up to 23%, 15 and 30 mg/kg dose groups only). AP activities were significantly elevated (up to 116%) 2 weeks pd in the 45 mg/kg dose group. All other semen parameters evaluated were unaffected. Male fertility and fetal structural development were also unaffected. Of the seven semen parameters perturbed by ethylene dibromide in humans, four were also affected in the rabbit (sperm velocity, percentage motility, pH, and volume), whereas sperm number, viability, and morphology were not. Thus, some of the male reproductive effects of ethylene dibromide in the human have been modelled in the rabbit, although the rabbit appears not to be as sensitive, since semen parameters were affected only at doses close to the LD50 (55 mg/kg)."

The drugs were administered intraamniotically on ED 3 at doses 0.03 and 0.3 microg CDDP or 100 and 300 microg DBE per embryo. Body weight and absolute and relative measures of the mesonephroi (length, weight and form) were evaluated on ED 10. The higher doses of both agents affected the mass of this organ significantly. Simultaneously, a dose-dependent increase of renal malformations was detected in treated embryos, while the incidence of gross and cardiovascular defects was low (DBE) or absent (CDDP). Together with less pronounced effects on the total body growth, the results gave evidence for a higher sensitivity of the mesonephros to toxic insult when compared to the whole organism. A direct cytotoxic effect multiplied by concomitant injury of blood supply seemed to be the main cause of CDDP nephrotoxicity. In the case of DBE, damage to the mesonephros was probably associated with a primary impairment of the vascular network. The chick embryo in ovo provides a promising system for the assessment of nephrotoxic effects induced by prospective therapeutic agents and environmental contaminants during the prenatal period."

Also, hAGT did not enhance the genotoxicity of S-(2-haloethyl)glutathiones that mimic the reactive product of the reaction of DBE with glutathione, which is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase. These experiments support a mechanism by which hAGT activates DBE. Studies in vitro showed a direct reaction between purified recombinant hAGT and DBE resulting in a loss of AGT repair activity and a formation of an hAGT-DBE conjugate at Cys(145). A 2-hydroxyethyl adduct was found by mass spectrometry to be present in the Gly(136)-Arg(147) peptide from tryptic digests of AGT reacted with DBE. Incubation of AGT with DBE and oligodeoxyribonucleotides led to the formation of covalent AGT-oligonucleotide complexes.

As anticipated for cells where the G(1)/S checkpoint was abrogated, the transformed cells exhibited a significant reinforcement of the radiation-induced G(2)/M checkpoint, the only checkpoint remaining to protect genomic integrity. However, cyclin A(1) and B(1) coexpression and cyclin A(1) overexpression were found despite the G2 arrest in irradiated cells and these signals likely attenuate the G(2)/M checkpoint. These alterations to normal cell cycling may promote the emergence of both numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities and their tolerance. Such a condition could play a key role in neoplastic transformation and be crucial in tumor progression. Furthermore, cyclin A(1) overexpression may play an autonomous role in the neoplastic transformation of BALB/c 3T3 cells, as it does in other cell types of mesenchymal origin."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Cell transformation assays (CTAs) are currently regarded as the only possible in vitro alternative to animal testing for carcinogenesis studies. CTAs have been proposed as screening tests for the carcinogenic potential of compounds that have no evidence of genotoxicity but present structural alerts for carcinogenicity. We have extensively used the BALB/c 3T3 model based on the A31 cell clone to test single chemicals, complex mixtures and environmental pollutants. In the prevalidation study carried out by ECVAM, the improved protocol is based on BALB/c 3T3 A31-1-1 cells, a clone derived by A31 cells, that is very sensitive to PAH-induced transformation. The present study was performed in the aim to compare the results obtained with the two different clones exposed to different classes of carcinogens. Cells were treated with PAHs (3-methylcholanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene), alkylating agents (melphalan) and aloethanes (1,2-dibromoethane). The induction of cytotoxicity and the onset of chemically transformed foci were evaluated by two experimental protocols, differing for cell seeding density and chemical treatment duration. The A31-1-1 cells showed higher inherent transformation rate after PAHs treatment, but they were insensitive to 1,2-dibromoethane at concentrations that usually induced transformation in A31 cells. As 1,2-dibromoethane is bioactivated to reactive forms able to bind DNA mainly through the conjugation with intracellular glutathione, these results suggested a reduced activity of phase-2 enzymes involved in glutathione conjugation in A31-1-1 cells. Our results give evidence that inherent metabolic capacity of cells may play a critical role in in vitro cell transformation, cautioning against possible misclassification of chemicals."

To identify a specific biomarker for these carcinogens in cells, the cellular proteome of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells treated with these compounds was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Of 50 protein spots showing a greater than 1.5-fold increase or decrease in intensity compared to control cells on a 2-D gel, we focused on the candidate biomarker moesin. Western analysis using monoclonal rabbit anti-moesin confirmed the identity of the protein and its increased level of expression upon exposure to the carcinogenic compounds. Moesin expression also increased in cells treated with six additional genotoxic carcinogens, verifying that moesin could serve as a biomarker to monitor phenotypic change upon exposure to genotoxic carcinogens in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells."

Eight protein spots that showed a greater than 1.5-fold increase or decrease in intensity following carcinogen treatment compared with treatment with noncarcinogens were selected. Of the identified proteins, we focused on the candidate biomarker ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), the expression of which was specifically increased in response to treatment with the carcinogens. The expression level of EBP50 was determined by western analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-EBP50 antibody. Further, the expression level of EBP50 was increased in cells treated with seven additional carcinogens, verifying that EBP50 could serve as a specific biomarker for carcinogens."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Several studies with bacteria and in vitro mammalian systems have provided evidence of the roles of two thiol-based conjugation systems, glutathione (GSH) transferase and O(6)-alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT), in the bioactivation of the bis-electrophiles 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), the latter an oxidation product of 1,3-butadiene. The in vivo relevance of these conjugation reactions to biological activity in mammals has not been addressed, particularly with DEB. In this work, we used transgenic Big Blue mice, utilizing the cII gene, to examine the effects of manipulation of conjugation pathways on liver mutations arising from dibromoethane and DEB in vivo. Treatment of the mice with butathionine sulfoxime (BSO) prior to dibromoethane lowered hepatic GSH levels, dibromoethane-GSH DNA adduct levels (N(7)-guanyl), and the cII mutation frequency. Administration of O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)-BzGua), an inhibitor of AGT, did not change the mutation frequency. Depletion of GSH (BSO) and AGT (O(6)-BzGua) lowered the mutation frequency induced by DEB, and BSO lowered the levels of GSH-DEB N(7)-guanyl and N(6)-adenyl DNA adducts. Our results provide evidence that the GSH conjugation pathway is a major in vivo factor in dibromoethane genotoxicity; both GSH conjugation and AGT conjugation are major factors in the genotoxicity of DEB. The latter findings are considered to be relevant to the carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene."
