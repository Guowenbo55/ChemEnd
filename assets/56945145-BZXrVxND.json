            "content": "Oxathiapiprolin is a recently registered fungicide in the United States that has shown significant efficacy against Phytophthora blight on bell pepper. However, it was previously unknown whether oxathiapiprolin translocates systemically in bell pepper plants after application. Experiments were conducted to determine the uptake of oxathiapiprolin by pepper plants and its movement within the plant system. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify oxathiapiprolin in plant tissues, with a recovery percentage ranging from 87.0% to 119.3%. When applied to the roots of bell pepper plants grown in hydroponics, oxathiapiprolin was detected in the roots within 4 hours and in the cotyledon, first true leaf, and second true leaf within 8 hours. In greenhouse studies with potted bell pepper plants, oxathiapiprolin was detectable in the roots within 3 days and in the stem and first true leaf within 6 days when applied at 100 \u03bcg/g. When applied at 400 \u03bcg/g, it was detected in the root, stem, first true leaf, and top new leaf. These findings provide valuable information for designing effective fungicide application strategies for managing Phytophthora blight in bell pepper.",

The results showed that both fungicides mainly accumulated in the tomato roots with limited translocation to the upper parts of the plant. Root absorption and inhibitor studies indicated the dominance of apoplastic and symplastic pathways in the uptake of oxathiapiprolin and famoxadone by the tomato roots, respectively. The uptake process for both fungicides followed passive and aquaporin-dependent transport mechanisms. In terms of storage, insoluble cell components such as cell organelles and walls were the dominant compartments for both fungicides. In the protoplast, oxathiapiprolin had a higher proportion in the soluble fraction compared to famoxadone. Overall, the study provides a detailed understanding of the transfer of oxathiapiprolin and famoxadone from the environment to tomato plants, which can be useful for predicting their uptake and distribution.",
