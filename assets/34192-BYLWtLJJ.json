Seedlings of \u2018Dark Green Boston\u2019 (BOS), a susceptible cultivar, were found to show significant inhibitions in foliar growth compared to the tolerant \u2018Great Lakes 366\u2019 (GLA). Reductions of 57% occurred in BOS leaf dry weights at rates of 3 \u03bcM thiobencarb as soon as 4 days after treatment. In addition, growth abnormalities including fused leaves were observed in the BOS cultivar, indicating inhibition early in leaf development at the meristem. Twenty-nine and 22% of applied 14C-thiobencarb was absorbed from nutrient solution by BOS and GLA, respectively. This difference is probably due to BOS having a 50% greater root system at the time of treatment. Greater absorption and accumulation of radioactivity in the leaves, as well as significantly greater amounts of parent 14C-thiobencarb in the foliage of BOS compared to GLA (30 and 19%, respectively) may account for the selectivity observed. Metabolism of 14C-thiobencarb occurred within 1 day in both cultivars, with the apparent production of herbicide conjugates accounting for more than 90% of the extracted radiolabel 12 days after treatment. A thiobencarb sulfoxide metabolite was not identified in these studies, indicating sulfoxide production is not a mechanism of selectivity in lettuce.",
