This acylamidase did not catalyze hydrolysis of dicryl, karsil, fenuron, monuron or IPC. It seems to be different than acylamidases isolated from rice, rat liver and chick kidney.

Initial experiments addressed whether PRN alters the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway for antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) , thereby indirectly affecting effector function. These experiments demonstrated that PRN does not impair the activation of CTLs by PRN-treated APCs. Subsequent experiments addressed whether PRN treatment of CTLs directly inhibits their activation and revealed that 1 degrees alloreactive CTLs exposed to PRN are unimpaired in their proliferative response and only marginally inhibited in their lytic activity. Surprisingly, secondary stimulation of these alloreactive CTL effectors, however, even in the absence of further PRN exposure, resulted in complete abrogation of CTL lytic function and a delayed but significant long-term effect on CTL responsiveness. These findings may have important implications for the diagnosis and clinical management of anomalies of cell-mediated immunity resulting from environmental exposure to various herbicides and other pesticides."

            "Value": "... Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of the IC-21 macrophage cell line with DCPA resulted in changes of critical macrophage functions, including a decrease in cytokine production, and in the ability to phagocytize and kill bacteria. To understand the mechanism involved in the propanil induced changes, a proteomics analysis was undertaken. For this study, IC-21 cells were exposed to 100 uM propanil or ethanol (vehicle) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. After 30 min of exposure, cytosolic fraction was isolated and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differential statistical analysis identified 12 spots that were all decreased in the propanil exposed cells compared to vehicle. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the proteins, which was later confirmed by other methods. One of these proteins, Sorting Nexin 6 (SNX6) interacts with the TGF-beta family of receptor serine-threonine kinases and associates with early endosomes during intracellular receptor trafficking. Another protein, H+-ATPase functions as a cytoplasmic pH-regulator promoting acidification of intracellular compartments in macrophages during the respiratory burst. A third protein, fibroblast growth factor regulated-1 (FR-1) protein induced by FGF-1 stimulation is important for enhancement of phagocytosis and plays a role in promoting inflammation. Confirmation of other significantly changed proteins and linking their identity to the alterations in macrophage function is currently in progress. Together the data from toxicoproteomics analysis provides an additional evidence of the mechanism by which propanil suppresses macrophage functions."

            "Value": "Stimulation of T cells through the T-cell receptor results in the activation of a series of signaling pathways that leads to the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2 and cell proliferation. Influx of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the extracellular environment, following internal Ca(2+) store depletion, provides the elevated and sustained intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) critical for optimal T-cell activation. Our laboratory has documented that exposure to the herbicide 3,4-dichloropropionanilide (DCPA) inhibits intracellular signaling events that have one or more Ca(2+) dependent steps. Herein we report that DCPA attenuates the normal elevated and sustained [Ca(2+)](i) that follows internal store depletion in the human leukemic Jurkat T cell line and primary mouse T cells. DCPA did not alter the depletion of internal Ca(2+) stores when stimulated by anti-CD3 or thapsigargin demonstrating that early inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated signaling and depletion of Ca(2+) stores were unaffected. 2-Aminoethyldiphenol borate (2-APB) is known to alter the store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) influx that follows Ca(2+) store depletion. Exposure of Jurkat cells to either DCPA or 50 uM 2-APB attenuated the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) following thapsigargin or anti-CD3 induced store depletion in a similar manner. At low concentrations, 2-APB enhances SOC influx but this enhancement is abrogated in the presence of DCPA. This alteration in [Ca(2+)](i), when exposed to DCPA, significantly reduces nuclear levels of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and IL-2 secretion. The plasma membrane polarization profile is not altered by DCPA exposure. Taken together, these data indicate that DCPA inhibits T-cell activation by altering Ca(2+) homeostasis following store depletion."

Pretreatment with tri-o-cresylphosphate (triorthotolyl phosphate, TOTP), an esterase inhibitor, prevented cyanosis but slightly enhanced the CNS depressant actions of propanil. Propanil and a probable hydrolytic metabolite, 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), produced methemoglobinemia in mice. Comparison of the time- and dose-response relationships for equimolar doses of propanil and DCA showed that DCA was more potent and had a faster onset of methemoglobin production than propanil. The hydrolysis of propanil to yield 3,4-dichloroaniline by liver homogenates was completely inhibited 18 hr after mice were given 125 mg/kg of TOTP. Methemoglobin formation after propanil was inhibited in mice pretreated with 125 mg/kg of TOTP, but TOTP did not affect DCA-induced methemoglobinemia. Inhibition of propanil-amidase activity and propanil-induced methemoglobinemia had similar TOTP dose- and time-response relationships. Pretreatment with SKF-525A inhibited and phenobarbital pretreatment slightly increased both propanil- and DCA-induced methemoglobin formation.

Mice were dosed daily for 28 days with atrazine, ethanol, propanil, or subjected to restraint, which are known to induce neuroendocrine stress responses and thereby to alter several immunological parameters.

Corticosterone concentration at various times after dosing (or restraint) was also measured. Comparison of these results with results from previous studies with a single acute exposure revealed that the corticosterone response was almost completely absent in mice treated with ethanol, reduced in mice treated with restraint and propanil, and for atrazine the response was the same as noted for acute exposure. In most cases, the changes in immunological parameters were consistent with expectations based on these corticosterone responses. However, in a few cases (e.g., NK cell activity), it was clear that there were effects not mediated by stress. These results indicate that the nature of the stressor determines whether mice become tolerant with regard to the stress response and consequent immunological effects.

Ovariectomy abrogated the effect of propanil on the /phosphorycholine/ PC-specific ASC response. Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that propanil does not bind either estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or beta. Exogenous estradiol administration in ovariectomized mice failed to restore the effect of propanil on the PC response. Treatment of female mice with a pure ER antagonist, ICI 182,780, or the progesterone antagonist RU486 did not inhibit the increase in ASCs. These data suggest that estrogen and progesterone do not regulate the effect of propanil. However, complete inhibition of steroid synthesis with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist antide abrogated the increased response in propanil-treated mice, indicating a necessary role for steroid synthesis. Experiments in male mice demonstrated that propanil increased the number of /antibody-secreting cells (ASCs)/ comparable to female mice. However, orchiectomy did not inhibit this effect, suggesting that androgens do not regulate the amplification of the humoral response.

Propanil, 3,4-DCA, propionic acid (0.1-5.0 mM), or vehicle was incubated for 15-120 min with isolated renal cortical cells (IRCC; approximately 4 million cells/mL) obtained from untreated male Fischer 344 rats. Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release from IRCC. In 120-min incubations, propanil induced cytotoxicity at concentrations >0.5 mM. At 1.0 mM, propanil induced cytotoxicity following 60- or 120-min exposure. Cytotoxicity was observed with 3,4-DCA (2.0 mM) at 60 and 120 min, while propionic acid (5.0 mM) induced cytotoxicity at 60 min.

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ The effect of propanil on mouse peritoneal macrophages was measured by determining cytotoxicity via the P815 cell line, which is resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although control animals showed a typical pattern of requiring both interferon gamma and lipopolysaccharide for mouse peritoneal macrophages activation, mouse peritoneal macrophages from propanil treated animals were cytotoxic when induced with lipopolysaccharide alone. This suggested that propanil influenced endogenous interferon levels. This was confirmed by the abrogation of cytotoxicity upon addition of anti-interferon to the cultures. When cells were assayed for interferon transcript, mRNA in resident mouse peritoneal macrophages was present in higher concentrations in propanil treated animals. Interferon mRNA was present in even higher concentrations in mouse peritoneal macrophages from propanil treated animals after 30 min of culture with lipopolysaccharide, whereas control mouse peritoneal macrophages required 4 hr in culture with lipopolysaccharide to produce similar levels. Interferon protein levels were also higher in propanil treated mouse peritoneal macrophages after culture in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. Thus, propanil induces increased levels of endogenous interferon which probably works in conjunction with lipopolysaccharide to induce P815 cytotoxicity. Because of the known influence interferon has on the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, the tumoricidal activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages from propanil treated animals were tested against tumor necrosis factor alpha sensitive cell lines. When using WEHI-164 or L929 cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages from propanil treated animals revealed tumoricidal activity with just the addition of lipopolysaccharide or interferon gamma. This implies that the additional endogenous levels of interferon, combined with other propanil induced effects, caused increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from mouse peritoneal macrophages."

A proposed mechanism for propanil induced methemoglobinemia and hemoglobin binding was presented. The mechanism suggested that propanil is metabolized in the liver to N-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline, which then enters the erythrocytes wherein it is oxidized by hemoglobin to 3,4-dichloronitrosobenzene and methemoglobin. The 3,4-dichloronitrosobenzene can be reduced to the hydroxylamine to undergo another cycle of hemoglobin oxidation or react with cysteine residues on hemoglobin to form the corresponding sulfinic acid amide adduct. It was suggested that hemoglobin binding could be used as a dosimeter to monitor occupational exposure to propanil."

To investigate the in vivo effects, we examined the gene expression of AhR-inducible cytochrome P450 1As (CYP1As) in the liver of female C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally injected with these three herbicides (300 mg kg(-1)) by quantitative RT-PCR, resulting in induction of significant high levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs. This indicates that propanil, diuron and linuron possess AhR-mediated transactivation effect in vivo as well as in vitro."

It was hypothesized that the interaction between these two herbicides, when administered as a mixture, would result in a greater effect on the immune system than the individual components of the mixture. The present study demonstrates in a murine model that a mixture of propanil and 2,4-D, when compared to single herbicide exposures, exacerbates decreases in thymocyte populations  2 days  postexposure and inhibits the repopulation of T-cells in the thymus 7 days postexposure. Exposure to 150 mg herbicide/kg body weight of propanil or 2,4-D alone had no effect on thymus weight. In contrast, decreases in the ratio of thymus weight to body weight (TW:BW) occurred 2 days after treatment with the mixture of 150 mg propanil/kg body weight + 150 mg 2,4-D/kg body weight (150/150). Thymic atrophy was associated with a decrease in the double-positive thymocyte population (CD4+CD8+) and correlated with sera corticosterone levels from 600 to 1000 pg/mL. Therefore, the hypothesis was tested that glucocorticoids, induced after exposure to herbicides, were responsible for the thymic atrophy and depletion of thymocytes. However, similar levels of corticosterone were induced after exposure to 50, 100, or 150 mg propanil/kg body weight, and 50/50 or 100/100 mixture treatments, doses that did not produce thymic atrophy or cell loss. In addition, RU 486, a glucocorticoid receptor blocker, only partially abrogated the thymic atrophy in mice exposed to the 150/150 mixture of herbicides. These results suggest that glucocorticoids are only partially responsible for herbicide-induced thymic atrophy."

Propanil has previously been shown to affect the T cell dependent antibody response. To determine the immunotoxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline, as well as extend the previous immunotoxicity studies, several T cell dependent and independent immune responses were determined after 3,4-dichloroaniline or propanil exposure. Unlike propanil, 3,4-dichloroaniline caused a significant reduction in T dependent antibody production (anti-SRBC response) only at a high dose (150 mg/kg). 3,4- Dichloroaniline or propanil at 150 or 200 mg/kg, respectively, caused a significant reduction in the number of anti-DNP antibody producing cells. However, doses of 37 or 50 mg/kg of 3,4-dichloroaniline or propanil, respectively, caused an increase in the number of anti-DNP antibody producing cells. These data indicate that both propanil and 3,4-dichloroaniline have a differential effect on the T independent antibody response depending on the dose. Similar to propanil, 3,4-dichloroaniline (at 150 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in spleen wt and cellularity. The effect of 3,4-dichloroaniline or propanil on selected cellular immune functions was also determined. 3,4-Dichloroaniline caused a significant decrease in the natural killer cell activity at doses of 75 or 150 mg/kg, and propanil caused a significant decrease at 100 or 200 mg/kg. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, however, was unaffected even at 150 or 200 mg/kg 3,4-dichloroaniline or propanil, respectively. Thus, it appears that T cells are relatively resistant to the effects of propanil and 3,4- dichloroaniline, whereas, other immune cell types, eg, natural killer cells are sensitive to its effects."
