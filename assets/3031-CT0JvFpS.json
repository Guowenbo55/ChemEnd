A cellulose synthesis inhibitor, it is used as a pre-emergent and early post-emergent herbicide. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, a cellulose synthesis inhibitor, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a nitrile and a dichlorobenzene. It is functionally related to a benzonitrile.",

Soil biodegradation rate constants for dichlobenil in the range of 0.02 to 0.002 day-1 have been reported(2), corresponding to half-lives of about 35-346 days(2). A sediment biodegradation rate constant of 0.03 day-1 was calculated for a NY pond treated with granular dichlobenil(2). This rate constant corresponds to a degradation half-life of about 23 days(2). Field studies using a sandy soil and dichlobenil applied at 8.3 and 16.6 kg/ha indicate that the overall persistence time of dichlobenil is approximately one year(3). An initial half-life of approximately 4 weeks was observed for surface applied dichlobenil; however, this loss mechanism was largely due to volatilization(3). Incorporation of the granules into the soil by mechanical cultivation, markedly increased the persistence time of both dichlobenil and its metabolite dichlorobenzamide(3)."

A dose-dependent decrease of nonprotein sulfhydryls (mainly glutathione, GSH) in the olfactory mucosa was observed 2.5 hr following injection of dichlobenil (6, 12, 25 mg/kg). The synthetic GSH precursor N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased both the dichlobenil-induced toxicity and the covalent binding, whereas N-acetyl-D-cysteine had no effect. No protective effects of the cyanide antidotes nitrite, thiosulfate, or superoxide dismutase on the dichlobenil-induced toxicity were observed. In mice given the GSH-depleting agent phorone and a subtoxic dose of dichlobenil (6 mg/kg), an extensive toxicity and an increased covalent binding in the olfactory mucosa were demonstrated. Autoradiography showed no change in the distribution of covalent (14)C dichlobenil binding to nontarget tissues of phorone-treated mice. In conclusion, the results demonstrate a relationship between the degrees of covalent binding, GSH depletion, and toxicity of dichlobenil in the olfactory mucosa. Hence, the level of GSH appears to be of importance for the dichlobenil-induced toxicity in the olfactory mucosa."

            "Value": "The metabolic activation of the herbicide dichlobenil (2,6-dichloro (ring-(14)C) benzonitrile) in the olfactory mucosa of C57BL mice and Sprague Dawley rats was examined. In homogenates of the olfactory mucosa (mouse 1000 x g supernatants; rat microsomes), dichlobenil was metabolized and covalently bound to protein. The apparent Km, Vmax and V/K values showed that the olfactory mucosa had both a higher affinity for dichlobenil and a higher capacity/mg protein to activate dichlobenil in comparison to the liver. The covalent binding was dependent on NADPH and was inhibited by the addition of dithionite, metyrapone and glutathione indicating an oxidative cytochrome P-450 dependent activation of dichlobenil into an electrophilic intermediate. The covalent binding was also inhibited by the addition of superoxide dismutase whereas catalase, mannitol or dimethylsulfoxide had no effect indicating the involvement of O2- but not of H2O2 or OH. in the activation. In explants of the olfactory mucosa incubated with (14)C dichlobenil a preferential covalent binding was observed in the Bowman's glands suggesting an activation of dichlobenil in these structures. The highly efficient metabolic activation of dichlobenil to reactive intermediates in the olfactory mucosa is suggested to be of importance for the potent dichlobenil-induced toxicity in this tissue."

The herbicide is metabolized to a reactive metabolite that becomes bound in the glands.

There were an additional 50 hamsters/sex for the control group. Histopathology was conducted upon completion of treatment. Administration of dichlobenil did not result in an increase in tumor incidence in any tissue. The incidence of several non-neoplastic endpoints was significantly increased but did not increase with increasing dose. The NOEL for systemic toxicity was 9.20 mg/kg/day. At 675 ppm in males, the incidences of islet cell hyperplasia of the pancreas, reduced secretion in the prostate and seminal vesicles, and acanthosis of the skin were significantly increased above controls. At 675 ppm in females: the incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement and rarefaction in the liver, cortical hyperplasia of the adrenals, epithelial hyperplasia of the stomach, hyperplasia of bone marrow in the sternum, submucosal inflammatory cells in the stomach, peritonitis, prominent mucous cells in the cecum, luminal dilation of the rectum, and hyperkeratosis of the skin were significantly increased above controls.
