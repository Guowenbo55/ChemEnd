    "Description": "Acifluorfen is a member of the class of benzoic acids that is 2-nitrobenzoic acid in which the hydrogen at position 5 is replaced by a 2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy group. It is a herbicide used for the post-emergence control of a variety of annual broadleaf weeds. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor. It is a member of benzoic acids, an organochlorine compound, an organofluorine compound, an aromatic ether, a monocarboxylic acid and a C-nitro compound.",

An application to plants of 0.3 kg ai/ha mefluidide {N-[2,4-dimethyl-5-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] amino] phenyl] acetamide} 0, 3, 5, or 7 days prior to treatment with 14C-acifluorfen often altered one or more of the physiological processes under study. Pretreatment of ivyleaf morningglory with mefluidide 3, 5, or 7 days prior to application of 14C-acifluorfen increased penetration of 14C and decreased metabolism of acifluorfen, while translocation was unaffected. All mefluidide treatments increased penetration of 14C-acifluorfen into velvetleaf, while the 3-, 5-, and 7-day pretreatments decreased acifluorfen metabolism. Penetration of acifluorfen into common cocklebur was unaffected by pretreatment with mefluidide. However, the 7-day mefluidide pretreatment of common cocklebur increased translocation of 14C into the upper leaves and decreased acifluorfen metabolism. Penetration and translocation of the radiolabel from 14C-acifluorfen in soybean was unaffected by pretreatment with mefluidide. Metabolism of acifluorfen by soybean was decreased by the 0-day mefluidide treatment but was unaffected by the 3-, 5-, or 7-day mefluidide pretreatment.",
