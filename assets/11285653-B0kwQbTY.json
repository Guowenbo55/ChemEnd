A cereal fungicide used to control a wide range of diseases including brown rust, tan spot, powdery mildew and net blotch. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aromatic ether, an enoate ester, an enol ether, an organofluorine compound, a member of pyridines and a methoxyacrylate strobilurin antifungal agent.",

Picoxystrobin is more systemic than thifluzamide, and at 48 h translocation may have moved much of the compound beyond distal zone 2 where it would not be detected. Published results of tests with radiolabeled fungicides fluoxastrobin and prothioconazole in a dropline application demonstrated an increase in distal accumulation between 1 and 2 days, similar to thifluzamide. This suggests translocation of systemic fungicides generally increases over time as the compound moves further within the plant.",
