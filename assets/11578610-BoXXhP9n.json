A ryanodine receptor agonist, it is used as insecticide for the control of whitefly, thrips, aphids, fruitflies, and fruit worms in crops such as onions, potatoes and tomatoes. It is highly toxic to honeybees. It has a role as a ryanodine receptor agonist. It is a pyrazole insecticide, a nitrile, an organochlorine compound, an organobromine compound, a member of pyridines and a secondary carboxamide.",

In the hydroponics experiment, cyantraniliprole was found to be absorbed by wheat roots primarily through the apoplastic pathway and predominantly distributed in the cell-soluble fraction (81.4\u221283.6%). It was ultimately transferred upward to the leaves (translocation factor leave/stem = 4.84, which was greater than the translocation factor stem/root). In wheat-soil systems, the uptake of cyantraniliprole was similar to that in hydroponics. The accumulation of cyantraniliprole in wheat tissues was mainly influenced by the content of soil organic matter and clay, leading to increased adsorption of cyantraniliprole onto soils (R2 > 0.991, P < 0.01). The accumulation was positively related to the concentration of cyantraniliprole in soil pore water (R2 > 0.991, P < 0.001). Additionally, the absorption of cyantraniliprole by wheat was well predicted by the partition-limited model.",

Plant uptake is crucial in determining how cyantraniliprole moves through the food chain. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting its accumulation in rice and potential human exposure. In a hydroponic-rice system, cyantraniliprole was found to be easily absorbed by rice roots via passive diffusion through the apoplastic pathway. It was then translocated upward through the xylem, but its acropetal translocation was limited. Cyantraniliprole in shoots could also be downward translocated through the phloem, although to a limited extent, indicating rice plants' weak phloem movement capacity. Additionally, cyantraniliprole exhibited a short half-life in sediment-water systems and dissipated faster in anaerobic than aerobic conditions. At the equilibrium stage of a sediment-water system, cyantraniliprole preferentially partitioned to the solid phase.",

Chrysanthemum plants absorbed these pesticides from soils to various degrees, with bioconcentration factors (BCF) positively correlated with the lipophilicity (log Kow) of pesticides.

Metalaxyl-M and cyantraniliprole, with medium lipophilicity (log Kow of 1.71 and 2.02, respectively), and hydrophilic thiamethoxam showed relatively strong translocation potentials with TF values in the range of 0.29\u20130.81, 0.36\u20132.74, and 0.30\u20131.03, respectively.",
