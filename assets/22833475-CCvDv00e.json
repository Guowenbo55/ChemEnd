In total, 42 samples of mussel, mullet, goby, sardine, Japanese sea bass, horse mackerel, and hairtail, were analyzed(1). Seven of 17 fish and shellfish samples collected in the Osaka area contained 0.1-14.6 ug/kg of tetrabromodiphenyl ether and 3 samples of mussels from Osaka bay contained 1.6-14.6 ug/kg (wet wt)(1). Single samples of sardine, Japanese sea bass, mackerel and hairtail contained levels of 0.1-0.8 ug/kg of tetrabromodiphenyl ether(1). The other species did not contain tetrabromodiphenyl ether (detection limit <0.1 ug/kg)(1). The concentration of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether was measured in the liver of cod, collected in the southern, central, and northern North Sea, in the period 1983-89(2,3). Each sample consisted of 25 fish(2,3). The highest levels (up to 360 ug/kg) were found in the liver of cod from the southern part and the lowest levels (up to 68 ug/kg on a fat basis) in the northern part of the North Sea(2,3). The concentrations showed a decreasing trend from the southern region to the northern region(2,3). Herring collected in the 3 areas and the Straits of Dover in 1985, contained avg 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether concentrations of 8.4-100 ug/kg on a fat basis(2,3). Eels collected in Dutch freshwater (rivers and lakes) at 10 places were analyzed for the presence of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether, during the period 1983-89(2,3). The concentrations were <20-1,700 ug/kg, on a fat basis(2,3). In these marine and freshwater fish, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether was always found as the main component, i.e., 70% of the total brominated diphenyl ethers(2,3). Fish were collected from 5 different localities along the Viskan and Haggan river system and the Klosterfjorden bay in Sweden. Muscle and, in some cases, also the liver of bream, eel, pike, sea trout, and tench were analyzed(3). Muscle tissue from bream, pike, and perch from the Viskan and Haggan rivers in Sweden contained levels of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether of 1-23 mg/kg (on a fat basis)(3). Perch from the Viskan river had the highest levels (23 mg/kg)(3)."
