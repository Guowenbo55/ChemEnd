A mixed culture of microorganisms isolated from soil also biodegraded chlorpropham(1,6). In a perfused soil, a lag period of about 4 days occurred before the onset of biodegradation(1). Biodegradation of chlorpropham may be the major degradative mechanism in soil(7). Chlorpropham biodegrades by hydrolytic reactions and the suggested products in soil microbial cultures are N-phenyl-3-chlorocarbamic acid, isopropanol, 3-chloraniline, carbon dioxide, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and its condensation products(5)."

            "Value": "In the concn range 6-7 mg/L, chlorpropham did not metabolize in a river water or in a 2% settled sewage solution(1). The biodegradation of chlorpropham in water followed second order kinetics. The rate depended on both concn of chlorpropham and the degrader population(2). The rate constant for the biodegradation of chlorpropham in environmental waters ranged from 1.3X10-14 to 4.9X10-14 organism-hr(2,4-5). Based on a mean rate constant of 2.6X10-14 organism-hr and a bacterial concn of 5X10+8 organisms/L, the half-life has been estimated to be 2,208 days(5). Adsorption to sediment and soil will decrease the rate of biodegradation(3)."

Mice were sham exposed or treated with 0.15%, 0.30%, or 0.60% chlorpropham in the diet from 5 weeks of age and during mating, gestation, and lactation; the F1 generation was also exposed to chlorpropham from 4 to 9 weeks of age. Neurobehavioral activity in the F0 generation, reproduction, number of litters and offspring, and average litter size, weight, and sex ratio were not significantly affected by chlorpropham. F0 females treated with the high dose showed a tendency toward restraint of number of horizontal activities. In addition, the average body weight of offspring was significantly affected in the low dose group of each sex and in high dose females. Dose related alterations in surface righting at postnatal day 7 and in swimming head angle at postnatal day 4 were seen in males of the F1 generation. High dose female offspring also demonstrated significant restraint of negative geotaxis at postnatal day 4 and significant depression of olfactory orientation at postnatal day 14. Chlorpropham also altered movement activity of exploratory behavior and multiple water T-maze performance in F1 mice at 3 weeks of age."

These species were selected because of their different susceptibilities to CIPC. The herbicide did not move out of the treated leaves in pigweed and smartweed and only slightly in parsnip in 21 days. In root treatment (3 days), the herbicide moved to all plant parts and the extent of movement was essentially the same in all species. Water soluble metabolites, which differed in Rf values were extracted from all three species. The metabolites apparently were not the result of cleavage of the CIPC molecule, but were more likely conjugates of CIPC with natural plant component(s). Very little 14C02 was released by any of the species in 3 days. He also isolated two water soluble metabolites of unknown structure from roots and shoots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) seedlings. Eshel and Warren (6) showed that CIPC has two types of postemergence action. In redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) control was dependent on translocation while in velvetleaf control (Abutilon theophrasti) was due more to direct contact action. These data indicate that differences in movement and metabolism are not sufficient to account for the different susceptibilities of these three plant species.",
