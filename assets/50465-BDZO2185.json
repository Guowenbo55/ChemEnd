    "Description": "Fluroxypyr is an aminopyridine that is pyridin-4-amine substituted by chloro groups at positions 3 and 5, a fluoro group at position 6 and a carboxymethoxy group at position 2. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a herbicide. It is an aminopyridine, an organochlorine compound, an aromatic ether, a monocarboxylic acid and an organofluorine compound.",

Wheat plants absorbed only small quantities through the roots, and these residues were not deposited in the grain, but in the straw/chaff fraction, which is recycled back to the field(1)."
