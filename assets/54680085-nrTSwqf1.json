            "Value": "Bromadiolone (0.04-0.38 mg/kg wet weight) was detected in livers of three stoats (Mustela erminea L.) and one weasel (Mustela nivalis L.) trapped or shot between August 1996 and March 1997 from eight estates in England(1). Median concentrations (ug/g) of bromadiolone in liver of various animals in France sampled between 1991-1994 were reported as: 1.5 red fox (n=22); 0.4 buzzard (n=15); 1.4 hare (n=2); 1.35 rabbit (n=2); 0.6 wild boar (n=3); 1.55 roe deer (n=3); 0.8 stone-marten (n=2); 1.3 lynx (n=1); 0.9 badger (n=1); 0.4 kite (n=5); 6.1 harrier (n=1); 2.3 mallard (n=1); 2.5 swan (n=1); 0.2 heron (n=1)(2). Bromadiolone was detected, at concentrations of 0.08-0.29 ug/g, in liver tissue from bird species (common buzzard, barn owl) collected from Loire Atlantique France in 2003(3). Bromadiolone was detected at concentrations of 0.40 and 0.85 mg/kg fresh weight in two tissue samples of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) collected from the upper Loire River (France) region between 2004-2008(4). In liver samples collected from 164 barn owls (Tyto alba), barred owls (Strix varia), and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), from 1988 to 2003 in the province of British Columbia and the Yukon Territory, Canada, bromadiolone was detected at a concentration range of 0.002-1.012 mg/kg in 84 of the 164 owls(5). Red kites (Milvus milvus) and common buzzards (Buteo buteo) collected in France in 2011 were either confirmed or highly suspected of bromadiolone poisoning(6). In liver samples from red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) from New Jersey, bromadiolone was detected in 20% of red-tailed hawks and 27% of great horned owls(7)."

            "content": "Three types of assessment techniques were utilized to explore the potential environmental hazards associated with two anticoagulant compounds used in rodent control. Firstly, rheological methodologies were employed to evaluate the ability of pelletized baits to endure precipitation, facilitating the development of objective criteria for agricultural producers to select suitable baits for specific climatic conditions. Secondly, bioanalytical evaluations of chlorophacinone demonstrated its decomposition into four nontoxic elements when exposed to ultraviolet light, suggesting that in the event of translocation, these elements, rather than the parent compound, would likely be involved. Lastly, radioactive (14C) bromadiolone underwent testing for translocatability, with preliminary data indicating minimal to no translocation up to the time of the report.",
