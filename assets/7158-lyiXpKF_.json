Negligible degradation was observed in air-dried soils(1). Biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP was tested in Mardin, Honeoye and Dunkirk silt loam soil samples from areas in NY, resulting in complete disappearance in greater than 47, 124 and 205 days, respectively(2). 2,4,5-TP was shown to have an aerobic half-life of 16 days in soil(5). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol has been identified as a product of the biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP(6). 2,4,5-TP was shown to have a half-life of 8 and 10 days in sandy loam, 15 and 21 days in forest soil, 13 days in clay loam and 14 days in grassland soil(7). In soil, 2,4,5-TP was reported to degrade more slowly than 2,4-D(8). No biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP was observed after 50 days incubation in Hamilton Harbour water from Ontario, Canada(3). An initial concn of 2,4,5-TP of 107.5 ppm was completely degraded in lagoon water in 9 days after 100 ml of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol acclimated water was added and incubated at 20 to 21 \u00b0C with constant aeration(4). 2,4,5-TP, incubated at 25 \u00b0C with sewage sludge in an aeration tank for 47 days gave an unchanged concentration of the S enantiomer and a 40% decrease in the R enantiomer(9)."
