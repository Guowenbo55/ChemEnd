The cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of calcium silicate using peripheral human blood lymphocytes is described. Calcium silicates at concn of 10 and 100 ug/ml significantly increased the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges. The increases in chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were dose-dependent, though not linearly. A significant decrease in the proliferation rate index was observed with increased dose of calcium silicates. The induction of chromatid type aberrations indicates that the clastogenic activity of calcium silicate is S-phase-dependent."

A study /was conducted/ in which FDA compound 71-41, hydrated calcium silicate, was suspended in 0.85% saline at concentrations of 1000, 500, 200, 100, and 10 ug/mL and applied to WI-38 cells in a logarithmic phase of growth. The cells were observed for cytopathic effects (CPEs) and the presence of mitosis at 24 and 48 hr. Inhibition of mitosis was observed at all concentrations except 100 and 10 ug/mL. A closer range of concentrations, 200, 150, 100, 75, and 50 ug/mL, were employed and tested for the same findings. Mitosis was stopped only in the cells dosed at 200 ug/mL. FDA compound 71-41, hydrated calcium silicate, was also tested for mutagenic properties in a host-mediated assay using the microorganisms Salmonella TA-1530 and G-46 and Saccharomyces D3. These experiments were carried out in mice orally administered (acute and subacute) 15, 150, and 1500 mg/kg of Calcium Silicate. No increased mutation frequencies were seen in Salmonella TA-1530 or G-46. Saccharomyces D3 had no significant increase in recombinant activity. In fact, a reduction in recombinant activity was produced by the compound. In a second host-mediated assay, Calcium Silicate was administered at 5000 mg/kg to mice against Salmonella TA-1530 and G46 and Saccharomyces D3. All tests were negative. Cytogenetic studies in vivo examined bone marrow cells arrested in C-metaphase from rats exposed to FDA compound 71-41, Calcium Silicate. Rats were administered 15, 150, and 1500 mg/kg doses. The positive control was triethylene melamine (TEM) and the negative control was saline. The chromosomal abnormalities observed in the positive control animals were significantly greater than those of either the negative control or the compound. The maximum effect of the positive control was observed at 48 hr after administration. Calcium silicate produced breaks in the range of 1% to 3% in all three acute dosage levels. However, these were not significantly higher than the negative controls. The subacute dose of 150 mg/kg produced breaks at 3%. The negative control breaks were consistent with those of other experiments. These same cytogenetic tests were observed in vitro. Cells (not specified) were observed in anaphase for chromosomal aberrations such as bridges, psuedochiasmata, multipolar cells, acentric fragments, etc. Doses of calcium silicate were as follows: 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 ug/mL. Controls, both positive and negative, were the same as reported above. The positive control produced significantly greater  percentages of chromosomal aberrations than the negative control or test compound. There were no aberrations observed due to Calcium Silicate. In a third cytogenetic test, Calcium Silicate was administered to male rats in one dose and in five doses of 5000 mg/kg. A positive-control, TEM, and a negative-control, saline, were also tested. Metaphase spreads were prepared from the bone marrow cells of these animals and scored for chromosomal aberrations. Neither the variety nor the number of the aberrations differed significantly from the negative controls. Calcium Silicate was nonmutagenic. Dominant lethal assays were carried out in male rats administered FDA compound 71-41, hydrated Calcium Silicate, at doses of 15, 150, and 1500 mg/kg, both as one dose and as five doses. Also tested were the negative saline control and a positive TEM control. This assay measures the amount and type of fetal wastage that may occur following administration of a potential mutagen. Each treated male rat was mated with two virgin female rats each week for eight (acute) or seven (subacute) doses. Two weeks after mating, the female rats were sacrificed and the fertility index, preimplantation loss, and lethal effects were determined and compared with the same parameters calculated from the negative and positive controls. No significant findings were observed in the fertility index or preimplantation loss. The test compound was also administered at a dose of 5000 mg/kg. The protocol was the same as listed above. All parameter values did not differ significantly from that of the negative control. Comparing the data of both experiments indicates that hydrated Calcium Silicate does not induce dominant lethal mutations."

Indeed we obtained remarkable differences in ROS generation between unground and ground wollastonite fibers and negative results with fibers modified with ferric chloride and dithionite. In addition, ROS generation was partially inhibited (by 46-54%) in the reactions performed in the presence of 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea (DMTU), a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger. Wollastonite fibers were also analyzed for their ability to lyse erythrocytes and activate complement. Hemolytic potency was about twice that of chrysotile and half that of crocidolite. The levels of complement activation (via the alternate pathway) were about four-fifths of those measured in zymosan-activated plasma (a typical stimulus used to activate the alternate pathway), equal to those obtained with crocidolite, and two-thirds of those found with chrysotile. The addition of DMTU markedly reduced both these activities. Since asbestos fiber toxicity is mainly due to hydroxyl radical generation, our results indicate that wollastonite fibers are probably less toxic than asbestos fibers."
