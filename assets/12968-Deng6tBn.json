            "Value": "The herbicide S-ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) & 3 of its candidate metabolites (the sulfoxide, N-depropyl & S-methyl derivatives) inhibit mitochondrial low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in liver by 56 to 82% 2 hr after these thiocarbamates are administered ip to mice at 8 mg/kg. They also greatly elevate the acetaldehyde level (determined as the Obenzyloxime ether) in blood (up to 500 muM) & brain (up to 3 ppm) 30 min after two ip treatments, the first with the thiocarbamate at 40 mg/kg & 2 hr later with ethanol at 1000 mg/kg. EPTC at 4 mg/kg inhibits liver ALDH activity by 50% & at 8 & 18 mg/kg gives half of the maximum ethanol-dependent elevation of acetaldehyde levels in blood & brain, respectively. The in vivo effects of other thiocarbamate herbicides at 8 mg/kg on ALDH activity & 40 mg/kg on acetaldehyde levels decrease in the order of thiobencarb, pebulate, vemolate & molinate > butylate & triallate > > cycloate. The % inhibition of liver ALDH activity generally correlates with the elevation in blood & brain acetaldehyde under these treatment protocols. B.W. Hart & M.D. Faiman (Biochem. Pharmacol. 43 403-406, 1992) have shown that the alcohol-aversion drug disulfiram is metabolized to S-methyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate & its sulfoxide as the penultimate & ultimate metabolites inhibiting ALDH. Thus, the thiocarbamate herbicides & their metabolites are similar to the disulfiram metabolites not only in homologous structure but also in their potency range as ALDH inhibitors in vivo. On this basis some of the thiocarbamate herbicides may sensitize agricultural workers to ethanol intoxication."

Koc values for eptam were measured for 4 soil series with various organic matter (OM%) levels(1): e.g., Atterberry (2.2%), Columbia (1.1%), Keeton (0.3%), and Sorrento (1.8%); the Koc values were 136, 146, 264, and 143, respectively(3).
