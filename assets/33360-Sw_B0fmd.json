After soil applications, the roots absorbed and translocated to the foliage more ethofumesate or its metabolites than did the emerging hypocotyls. Ethofumesate or its metabolites did not accumulate in either roots or hypocotyls after exposure to treated soil. When sugar-beet leaves were treated with the herbicide at the two-leaf stage, acropetal translocation was rapid but there was no translocation out of the treated leaves. Furthermore, ethofumesate or its metabolites were not translocated basipetally after either soil or foliar application.",
