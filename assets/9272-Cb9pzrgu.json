            "Value": "When 10 and 100 ppm thionazin was added to soil, the oxygen consumption was found to increase proportionally over the endogenous level(1). The author concluded that microbial degradation was indicated(1). Thionazin at these concentrations was not found to be permanently deleterious to the microbiota(1). Thionazin was listed as being degradable by microbiological means(2). The oxygen consumption of a sandy loam soil was found to increase significantly above the level of endogenous respiration when 5 or 10 ug/g of thionazin was added(3). When applied to a sultan silty loam, thionazin was found to undergo removal at rates faster than those observed in autoclaved samples; the half-lives for removal were 2 weeks of the soil sample and 9 weeks for the autoclaved sample (25 \u00b0C, pH 6.3, 20% water moisture)(4). Thionazin was most persistent at pH 5.5, and least persistent at pH 8.1, however, the author concluded that this was due to a change in the biological species responsible for degradation, and not from abiotic processes(4). The persistence of thionazin was also found to decrease with increasing moisture content of the soil(4). In a related study, thionazin underwent 68%, 23%, 31%, and 22% degradation in sultan silty loam, autoclaved sample, irradiated sample, and irradiated and autoclaved sample, respectively(5). The difference between the degradation in the autoclaved and irradiated sample was attributed to presence of a heat labile substance, which could not be identified(5)."

            "Value": "Thionazin, a systemic organophosphorus pesticide, was investigated for its persistence and effectiveness in controlling potato aphids. The study examined three different agricultural soils with varying pH, clay content, and sand content. The results revealed that thionazin exhibited different rates of disappearance on different soil types. In an acid sandy soil, thionazin showed the longest persistence and systemic efficiency, with detectable residues remaining up to one year after application. In contrast, the higher-clay alkaline soil did not show any detectable residues after the same period. These findings suggest that thionazin's degradation and systemic efficiency are influenced by soil characteristics. Factors such as hydrolysis and irreversible sorption on clay particles may contribute to faster degradation and lower systemic efficiency in alkaline soils. Microbiological degradation and other unidentified substances in the soil could also play a role in pesticide degradation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the persistence and effectiveness of systemic pesticides like thionazin in different soil types for effective pest control."
