    "Description": "Prometon is a methoxy-1,3,5-triazine that is 6-methoxy-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine in which the one of the hydrogens of each amino group is substituted by an isopropyl group. It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a diamino-1,3,5-triazine and a methoxy-1,3,5-triazine. It is functionally related to a 6-methoxy-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.",

            "Value": "AEROBIC: In one investigation, no changes in phytotoxicity were observed in moist, organic soil treated with 17.5 ppm of prometon after 8 wk of incubation; the soil was adjusted to four pHs: 4.3, 5.3, 6.5, and 7.5(1). Several soil bacteria and fungi are reported to attack prometon(2). However, it is not known whether biodegradation is the primary degradation process in soil(2). Methoxy-s-triazines are more resistant to biodegradation than the corresponding methylthio- and chloro-s-triazines(2). Average soil half-life is reported as 932 days(3). In soil, microbial degradation involves hydrolytic cleavage of the methoxy group to give hydroxy metabolites, and dealkylation of the side chains(4). Persistence in soil can be as much as one year, depending upon soil type, moisture, and the application rate(4)."

            "Value": "In analyzing whether the triazines share a common mechanism of toxicity, /the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs/ OPP first examined the pesticides, atrazine, simazine, and cyanazine for inclusion in the initial common mechanism group. ...  Toxicologically, the pesticides are positive for mammary gland tumors in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and atrazine and simazine have data suggesting that they interfere with the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) pre-ovulatory surge. OPP then examined whether any other 1,3,5-triazines or other pesticides or metabolites containing s-triazine rings shared these characteristics. A subset of eight pesticides containing the triazine moiety -- atrazine, simazine, propazine, cyanazine, terbutylazine, terbumeton, terbutryn, tribenuron methyl (Express) -- from this larger group were found to cause the similar toxic effect of inducing mammary gland tumors in only female rats but not male rats or both sexes of mice. Several triazine-containing pesticides do not cause that carcinogenic profile -- ametryn, prometryn, prometon, metsulfuron methyl, trisulfuron, chlorsulfuron, and DPXM6316 (Harmony). It should be pointed out that there is no known common mechanism of toxicity to group ametryn, prometryn, prometon, metsulfuron methyl, trisulfuron, chlorsulfuron, or DPX-M6316 (Harmony) with the other eight pesticides."

            "Value": "A mean Koc of 524.3 was reported for prometon in 29 soils(1). The Freundlich adsorption constant, K, and exponent, 1/n, for prometon on San Joaquin sandy loam (0.72% organic carbon, 9.7% clay, pH 6.2) at 25 \u00b0C were 2.94 and 0.81, respectively; the corresponding Koc is 408 at a concn of 1 ppm and 305 at a concn of 10.3 ppm(2). Koc values of 572 and 395 were determined in Hanford sandy loam (0.43% organic C, pH 6.05, 7.1% clay, 25.8% silt, 67.1% sand) and Tujunga loamy sand (0.33% organic C, pH 6.3, 4.5% clay, 13.5% silt, 82.0% sand), respectively(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that prometon is expected to have low to moderate mobility in soil(SRC). Only 0.1% of prometon applied to a 30.5 cm column and leached under unsaturated flow conditions with 1.2 cm of water/day, was found in leachate at the end of 30 days(5). Prometon was included in mobility class 3, on a scale from 1 (immobile) to 5 (very mobile)(6). Prometon is adsorbed onto soil humic acid, forming stable complexes(7). Ionic, hydrogen bonding, electron donor-acceptor, and covalent forces contribute to the binding. The fact that the basicity of several s-triazines, and hence their tendency to form ionic bonds, is not correlated with adsorptivity indicate that ionic bonding is not the primary factor governing adsorption(7). Data on the free radical content of humic acid adducts, demonstrate that electron donor-acceptor forces are particularly important in the binding of prometon to soil(7). The Freundlich adsorption constant, K, and exponent, 1/n, for prometon on Volcay bentonite at 25 \u00b0C was 150 and 0.64, respectively(8). The mean sorption coefficient (Kd) of 4.86 was given for 59 measured values(9). A pKa of 4.3 at 21 \u00b0C(10) indicates prometon will exist predominately in the unionized form under environmental pHs(SRC). Max adsorption of prometon onto soil organic matter occurred in the pH range 4.2 to 5.2; the addition of HCl or NaOH decreased adsorption(11). Approximately 52% of the prometon adsorbed by organic matter was desorbed with two extractions of 0.1 N NaCl(11)."
