It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a 1,3,5-triazinylamino nitrile and a chloro-1,3,5-triazine.",

Cyanazine was found at 90 percent of the sites examined in a survey of 28 agrochemical dealerships in Iowa; the maximum concentration was 4,600 ppb(2)."

Less 14C-cyanazine was taken up by the foliage of corn than by the weed species. A lower concentration of parent cyanazine in corn leaves was also evident. The addition of a phytobland oil to the treatment solution increased foliar cyanazine absorption 1 and 5 days following treatment. Although rapid metabolism occurred in corn roots, the large amount of cyanazine absorbed via the root system resulted in internal concentrations of parent cyanazine similar to that observed in the weed species. Cyanazine translocation was mainly acropetal from the point of application. The basis of selectivity is not solely based on the differential foliar uptake of cyanazine, but also on the proportion taken up by the foliage and roots. Under conditions favoring uptake by roots, the margin of selectivity may be reduced.",
