The mice were challenged with an aerosol of Streptococci, and pulmonary bacterial activity of alveolar macrophages was assessed by exposure to aerosols of labeled Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant increases in mortality due to bacterial exposure and decreases in bacterial activity were observed after single 3 hour exposures to 271, 496, and 940 ug/cu m As. There was a significant positive linear relationship of increased mortality with increased As concentration. Inhalation of 500 ug/cu m and above produced consistently significant increases in mortality and decreases in pulmonary bactericidal activity after 1, 5, or 20 exposures."

Some mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 12 mg/kg arsenic trioxide or 6 mg/kg mercuric chloride. Ethylmethane sulfonate was injected ip at a dose of 200 mg/kg either alone or 20 minutes after injection of one of the other compounds. Other mice received either distilled water (negative controls) or mitomycin-C injections (positive controls). Animals were sacrificed after recovery periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Cytogenetic damage was evaluated by determining the frequency of gaps, breaks, and exchanges in bone marrow and in spermatogonia. Neither arsenic nor mercury alone induced an increased gaps, breaks, and exchanges in the cells examined. Ethylmethane sulfonte alone increased gaps in bone marrow cells but produced no other damaging effects. In the combined treatments, neither arsenic nor mercury affected the frequency of gaps, breaks, or exchanges induced by ethylmethane sulfonate alone. Acute arsenic and mercury do not enhance the chromosomal aberrations induced by ethylmethane sulfonate in either the bone marrow cells or spermatogonia of mice."

Serial necropsies were performed to assess the metal content in organs at times up to several weeks after exposure. The lung clearance varied widely for these compounds, and the times to remove 50% of the initial burden ranged from 18 min for vanadium to 400 days for beryllium. Arsenic, cadmium, lead, selenium, and vanadium were initially soluble in lung, but a small fraction (1-20%) remained there over the long term. Extrapulmonary tissues often accumulated substantial amounts of the soluble oxides, and whole body retention was often greater for compounds that were more soluble in lung. Arsenic, selenium, and vanadium translocated to carcass and bone. Arsenic, cadmium, lead, and selenium accumulated in the liver, and the kidney retained cadmium and lead. Beryllium, cobalt and ytterbium did not deposit at any extrapulmonary site in significant amounts. In general, the aqueous solubility of these compounds was a poor predictor for behavior in vivo. Of the metal oxides tested for acute lethality following pulmonary deposition, cadmium was most toxic, followed by selenium, vanadium, and arsenic."

            "Value": "The relative toxicity of gallium arsenide and its metal oxides was assessed by intratracheally instilling particulate suspensions of gallium arsenide (100 mg/kg), equimolar gallium as gallium trioxide (655 mg/kg), or a maximally tolerated nonlethal dose of arsenic as arsenic trioxide (17 mg/kg). Two weeks after dosing, rats were selected for the biochemical determination of lung lipid, protein, DNA, and collagen (4-hydroxyproline; 4-HP) content. The pulmonary retention of gallium and/or arsenic and the concentration of these metals in blood were also determined. Pulmonary exposure to gallium trioxide particulates significantly (p < 0.55) increased the total lipid content of lungs. This response appeared to be associated with the pulmonary retention of gallium particulates (means= 36% of the gallium dose). In contrast, arsenic trioxide particulates were not retained in the lung. Blood arsenic concentrations were 36 ppm which represented 20% of the total arsenic administered. Treatment with arsenic trioxide significantly elevated lung dry weight as well as protein, DNA, and 4-HP content. Arsenic trioxide induced an acute fibrogenic response. The intratracheal instillation of gallium arsenide particulates produced effects similar to those observed with the individual oxides. The total lung content of lipids, protein, and DNA was significantly elevated. These biochemical changes were accompanied by significant increases in lung dry weight and lung wet weight. Lungs from rats receiving gallium arsenide particulates retained 44% of the dose as gallium and 28% of the dose as arsenic at the end of the 14 day study. Blood arsenic concentrations were 44 ppm (7% of the arsenic dose) while gallium was not detected in blood at this time. The primary histopathological observations 14 days after the intratracheal instillation of all metal particulates were an inflammatory respponse and pneumonocyte hyperplasia. The biological serverity of these lesions, in descending order, was gallium arsenide greater than arsenic trioxide much greater than gallium trioxide."

Toxicity responses of reduced growth and feed consumption, and altered feeding behavior, were noted at all levels of supplementation of arsenic trioxide and disodium arsenate heptahydrate (137-1477) ug As/g diet). In contrast, even at the highest levels of supplementation (1497 ug As/g diet as dimethylarsinic acid, and 1503 ug As/g diet as arsanilic acid the organic arsenicals did not result in these toxicity signs. Carcass As concn showed a dose response relationship to dietary As concn, whereas at higher levels, dietary arsenic trioxide yielded the highest residues. The no observed effect concn for dietary arsenic trioxide lies between 1 and 137 ug As/g diet for disodium arsenate heptahydrate, between 1 and 180 ug As/g diet for arsenic trioxide, and is at least 1497 ug As/g diet for dimethylarsinic acid and arsanilic acid."
