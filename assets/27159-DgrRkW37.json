The concentrations of cartap in the leaf blades reached a maximum of 3.2 ppm and 2.1 ppm at the boot and panicle formation stages respectively 3 days after application, while the maximum concentration at the maximum tillering stage was 0.94 ppm 15 days after application. The concentrations of monocrotophos in the leaf blades reached a maximum of 1.4 ppm, 2.3 ppm and 2.1 ppm at the three stages respectively 3 days after application. LC50 values were calculated from mortality and insecticide concentration in the leaf blades, showing LC50 (24 hr) values for cartap were 0.68, 1.4 and 5.6 ppm and for monocrotophos were 0.60, 1.2 and 4.0 ppm in 1st, 3rd and 5th instar larvae respectively. Periods of exceeding LC50 (24 hr) levels for 1st instar larvae of cartap and monocrotophos in the leaf blades were 27 and 10 days at the boot stage, 25 and 9 days at the panicle formation stage and 21 and 11 days at the maximum tillering stage respectively.",

Over time, the upper part of the rice plants was harvested and separated into leaf blades and leaf sheaths for analysis of monocrotophos and cartap. Gas chromatography using a Shimadzu 5A instrument with a flame ionization detector was used for analysis. The separation column was 3 mm \u00d7 1.0 m, packed with 5% PEG-20M/GasChromQ (60-80 mesh).",
