Mixed cultures isolated from a polluted soil were shown to degrade 2,6-lutidine(2). The half-life of 2,6-lutidine was approximately 1 month in an unpolluted surface soil under aerobic conditions with 100% degradation observed after 3 months, while little degradation was observed under denitrifying and sulfate reducing conditions(3). The half-life was about 0.5 months in polluted surface and subsurface soils with 100% degradation observed after 1 month(3). 2,6-Lutidine was degraded approximately 30% during a 35 day incubation period in column experiments using contaminated groundwater from a coal tar producing chemical facility as inoculum(4). The half-life of 2,6-lutidine in polluted subsurface sediments was 6 days(4)."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,6-lutidine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of 2,6-lutidine is 6.6(4), which indicates that 2,6-lutidine will partially exist in the protonated form in moist soils and cations adsorb to soil surfaces more strongly than neutral compounds(SRC)."
