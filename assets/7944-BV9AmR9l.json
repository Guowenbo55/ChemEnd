Three bank infiltration studies from the Rhine river in The Hague showed a concentration of approximately 0.5 ug/l, which was not reduced at all after infiltration(2). In the Netherlands, 33% removal in <1 yr and 90% removal in <3 months was observed after bank and dune infiltration of Rhine water, respectively(3). A degradation half-life has been estimated to be 59 days and 3.1 days for bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether in a lake in the Rhine basin and in the Rhine river, respectively, based upon field monitoring data (includes dilution and evaporation)(3). AEROBIC SCREENING STUDIES: Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(4). Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether did not degrade after an experimental period of 40 days under aerobic conditions(5). In a static-culture-flask biodegradation screening procedure, utilizing biochemical oxygen demand and dilution water containing 5 mg of yeast extract per liter as the synthetic medium, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether was found to be significantly biodegradable with rapid adaptation. At a test concentration of 5 mg/l, the original culture achieved 85% biodegradation in 7 days and subcultures 100% in 7 days; when the test concentration was 10 mg/l, 63% biodegradation of the original culture was observed in 7 days and 100% in subcultures(6)."
