            "Value": "Crotonaldehyde, a highly electrophilic a, b-unsaturated aldehyde, is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and a risk factor for multiple respiratory diseases. Crotonaldehyde is highly volatile and hydrophilic, so it is efficiently absorbed in the respiratory tract. Alveolar macrophages are major effector cells of the nonspecific host defence in the lung. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways responsible for cell death of alveolar macrophage induced by crotonaldehyde. Our results show that crotonaldehyde induces apoptosis in alveolar macrophages, as indicated by phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation. Pretreatment of alveolar macrophages with N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol, superoxide dismutase inhibited crotonaldehyde-induced apoptosis. Crotonaldehyde-induced apoptosis was characterized by ROS generation, GSH depletion, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activation, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and the increase of p53 expression. Furthermore, pretreatment with either p53 inhibitor pifithrin-a or calcium chelator BAPTA-AM effectively attenuated apoptosis induced by crotonaldehyde. Taken together, our results showed that crotonaldehyde induce apoptosis in alveolar macrophages through intracellular calcium, mitochondria and p53 signaling pathways. These results would help to illustrate the mechanism of toxicity induced by crotonaldehyde and to look for a novel treatment for diseases induced by exposure to crotonaldehyde-rich pollutants such as cigarette smoke."

Likewise, pretreatment with ... crotonaldehyde could induce tolerance, in terms of LDH activity, towards a subsequent injection of acrolein. Histopathological examination revealed that spleen, adrenals and thymus were affected. The thymus markedly decreased in size after repeated injections of acrolein, crotonaldehyde or formaldehyde. Adrenalectomized mice given acrolein showed no thymus atrophy. A single injection of aldehyde caused an increased level of the adrenal hormone corticosterone in blood plasma. Adrenalectomized mice still showed a certain tolerance, in terms of LDH activity, after repeated injections of acrolein, but the increase in plasma LDH activity was smaller than for normal animals. Treatment with acrolein for six days did not change the level of reduced glutathione or the glutathione S-transferase activity in liver cytosol, but the rate of glutathione synthesis was increased. It is concluded that adrenalectomy does not completely prevent the development of tolerance in mice."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ The alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes (enals) acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and trans-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) are products of endogenous lipid peroxidation, arising as a consequence of oxidative stress. The addition of enals to dG involves Michael addition of the N(2)-amine to give N(2)-(3-oxopropyl)-dG adducts, followed by reversible cyclization of N1 with the aldehyde, yielding 1,N(2)-dG exocyclic products. The 1,N(2)-dG exocyclic adducts from acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 4-HNE exist in human and rodent DNA. The enal-induced 1,N(2)-dG lesions are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing structurally defined 1,N(2)-dG adducts of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 4-HNE were synthesized via a postsynthetic modification strategy. Site-specific mutagenesis of enal adducts has been carried out in E. coli and various mammalian cells. In all cases, the predominant mutations observed are G-->T transversions, but these adducts are not strongly miscoding. When placed into duplex DNA opposite dC, the 1,N(2)-dG exocyclic lesions undergo ring opening to the corresponding N(2)-(3-oxopropyl)-dG derivatives. Significantly, this places a reactive aldehyde in the minor groove of DNA, and the adducted base possesses a modestly perturbed Watson-Crick face. Replication bypass studies in vitro indicate that DNA synthesis past the ring-opened lesions can be catalyzed by pol eta, pol iota, and pol kappa. It also can be accomplished by a combination of Rev1 and pol zeta acting sequentially. However, efficient nucleotide insertion opposite the 1,N(2)-dG ring-closed adducts can be carried out only by pol iota and Rev1, two DNA polymerases that do not rely on the Watson-Crick pairing to recognize the template base. The N(2)-(3-oxopropyl)-dG adducts can undergo further chemistry, forming interstrand DNA cross-links in the 5'-CpG-3' sequence, intrastrand DNA cross-links, or DNA-protein conjugates. NMR and mass spectrometric analyses indicate that the DNA interstand cross-links contain a mixture of carbinolamine and Schiff base, with the carbinolamine forms of the linkages predominating in duplex DNA. The reduced derivatives of the enal-mediated N(2)-dG:N(2)-dG interstrand cross-links can be processed in mammalian cells by a mechanism not requiring homologous recombination. Mutations are rarely generated during processing of these cross-links. In contrast, the reduced acrolein-mediated N(2)-dG peptide conjugates can be more mutagenic than the corresponding monoadduct. DNA polymerases of the DinB family, pol IV in E. coli and pol kappa in human, are implicated in error-free bypass of model acrolein-mediated N(2)-dG secondary adducts, the interstrand cross-links, and the peptide conjugates."

In addition, they are also common environmental pollutants originating from many different sources. Since conflicting data exist on their possible risk for humans, we have selected four lipid-peroxidation products namely acrolein, crotonaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-hexenal (4-HHE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (4-ONE) to determine their ability to induce mutagenicity in mammalian cells. There is an important lack of mutagenicity data on mammalian cells for such products, which presents an important gap for any risk-assessment estimation. We have used the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) to determine the mutagenic potential of these four compounds. This assay detects a broad spectrum of mutational events, from point mutations to chromosome alterations. The results obtained indicate that the four selected compounds are mutagenic in the MLA assay, showing a direct dose-effect relationship. The relative mutagenic potencies according to the induced mutant frequency (IMF) are as follows: crotonaldehyde (IMF=758.5x10(-6)), 4-ONE (IMF=700.5x10(-6)), acrolein (IMF=660.5x10(-6)) and 4-HHE (IMF=572x10(-6)). Although the differences between the induced mutant frequencies for these compounds are not very large, the a,b-unsaturated aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal turned out to be the agent most mutagenic. This is because its induced mutant frequency was reached after treatment with 10 uM, while 50 uM of the other compounds was needed to reach the reported frequencies."

Since the authentic ICLs can revert to monoadducts, a chemically stable model ICL, 1,3-bis(2'-deoxyguanos-N2-yl)butane derivative, was also employed to probe the ICL repair mechanism. Since the removal of ICL depends on the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism in Escherichia coli, the plasmid bearing the model ICL failed to yield transformants in NER-deficient host cells, proving the stability of this ICL in cells. The authentic ICLs yielded transformants in the NER-deficient hosts; therefore, these transformants are produced by plasmid bearing spontaneously reverted monoadducts. In contrast, in NER-deficient human cells, the model ICL was removed by an NER-independent repair pathway, which is unique to higher eukaryotes. This repair did not associate with a transcriptional event, but with replication. The analysis of repaired molecules revealed that the authentic and model ICLs were repaired mostly (>94%) in an error-free manner in both hosts. The major mutations that were observed were G --> T transversions targeting the cross-linked dG located in the lagging strand template. These results support one of the current models for the mammalian NER-independent ICL repair mechanism, in which a DNA endonuclease(s) unhooks an ICL from the leading strand template at a stalled replication fork site by incising on both sides of the ICL and then translesion synthesis is conducted across the \"half-excised\" ICL attached to the lagging strand template to restore DNA synthesis."
