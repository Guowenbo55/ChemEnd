            "Value": "OPs /including dialifor/ exert their neurotoxicity by binding to and phosphorylating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in both the central (brain) and peripheral nervous systems... .. There are laboratory animal data on OPs for cholinesterase activity in plasma, red blood cell (RBC) and brain, as well as behavioral or functional neurological effects in submitted guideline studies. Measures of acetylcholinesterase inhibition in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are very limited for the OP pesticides. As a matter of /EPA/ science policy, blood cholinesterase data (plasma and RBC) are considered appropriate surrogate measures of potential effects on PNS acetylcholinesterase activity and of potential effects on the central nervous system (CNS) when brain cholinesterase data are lacking..."
