    "Description": "Biphenyl is a benzenoid aromatic compound that consists of two benzene rings connected by a single covalent bond. Biphenyl occurs naturally in coal tar, crude oil, and natural gas. Formerly used as a fungicide for citrus crops. It has a role as an antimicrobial food preservative and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzenes, an aromatic fungicide and a member of biphenyls.",

In male and female mice, degenerative changes of the nasal cavity respiratory epithelium were reported at doses >/=100 mg/kg bw/day and degenerative changes of the respiratory nasopharynx at doses >/=300 mg/kg bw/day. Other findings included variations in serum enzyme levels (increase in alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase) and an increased urea nitrogen level in the low-dose males and females, which became more pronounced with increasing doses. In female mice receiving >/=300 mg Biphenyl/ kg bw/day and in the high-dose males, degenerative changes in the kidney (increased mineralization of the inner stripe of the outer medulla, increase in desquamation of the epithelium of the renal pelvis) were also observed. High-dose animals also showed reduced body weight gain and food consumption."
