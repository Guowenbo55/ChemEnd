            "Value": "Endeavour prawns from Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, and Groote Elylandt, Australia, contained 4-bromophenol at concentrations of 61 to 410, 370, and 370 ug/kg, respectively(1). Ten different species of fish, collected in August 1992 from the eastern coast of Australia, contained 4-bromophenol at concentrations of <0.05 to 0.2 ng/g for the carcass and <0.05 to 100 ng/g for the whole gut (analysis of single fish from each species)(2). Ocean fish were separated by species into pelagic carnivores, benthic carnivores, diverse omnivores and restricted omnivores; concentrations in the flesh ranged from <0.01 to 1.6 ng/g, <0.01 to 46 ng/g, <0.01 to 1.2, and <0.01 to 0.1 ng/g, respectively, while concentrations in the gut ranged from <0.01 to 1.1 ng/g, <0.01 to 2300 ng/g, <0.01 to 56 ng/g, and <0.01 to 0.8 ng/g, respectively(3). Thirty samples of 9 species of prawns, collected from the eastern coast of Australia from 1993 to 1996, contained 4-bromophenol at concentrations of <0.01 to 850 ng/g(4). 4-Bromophenol concentrations in cultivated prawns ranged from <0.01 to 0.56 ng/g in the head and <0.01 to 0.06 ng/g in the tail(4). 4-Bromophenol was detected in marine fish, mollusks, and crustaceans obtained from a seafood shop in Hong Kong. Seasonal concentrations in the flesh of rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus) and brown-spotted grouper (Epinepheus areolatus) was 0 ng/g (not detected) for each; in the gut, concentrations ranged from 0 to 206 ng/g and 0 ng/g, respectively. In the mullusks, including clams (Tapes philippinarum) and oysters (Ostrea rivularis), seasonal concentrations ranged from 0 to 55.6 ng/g and 0 ng/g, respectively. For crustaceans, seasonal concentrations in the cephalothorax and tail of the shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) ranged from 0 to 9.47 ng/g and 0 to 5.39 ng/g, respectively; in crab (Charybdis feriatus), concentrations ranged from 0 to 47.9 ng/g(5)."
