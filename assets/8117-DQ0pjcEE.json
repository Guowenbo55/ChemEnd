A crossover mating trial of the F0 mice to determine the affected sex was inconclusive, but suggested that offspring development was compromised in females exposed to 3.5% DEG. Slight maternal (F0) toxicity was noted for the 3.5 DEG group (7% decrease in body weight). The F1 generation, at 3.5% DEG, had decreased body weights at birth and exhibited poor postnatal survival. At the intermediate dose of DEG, body weights of both sexes were depressed at weaning, at onset of mating, and at necropsy. However, no adverse effects on reproduction were observed. DEGEE had no effect on reproduction in the F0 or F1 generation mice despite a 34% decrease in cauda epididymal sperm motility in the F1 males at 2.5% DEGEE. Other signs of toxicity observed in these F1 mice included increased relative liver weights.

At all dosages, fetuses from treated animals examined at autopsy on d 15 were found to be lighter than those from control animals. Abnormalities were seen at all dosages, mainly neural-tube defects (exencephaly, cranial bleb, and myelomeningocele). No neural-tube defects were observed in control animals. A dosage-related deficit in the number of live, externally nonmalformed fetuses was observed and was matched by a dosage-related increase in the number of live externally abnormal fetuses. Few dead full-term fetuses were found, but there was a dosage-related increase in the \"late\" resorption rate. A new summarizing measure, the fetal detriment (FD), the deficit from control expectations of live, nonmalformed litter mass per live litter, was found to be proportional to the square of the dose-rate D, the regression through the origin in this study being FD = (0.934 +/- 0.329)D2. The 50% attrition dosage, the AD50, was 2.90 mL/kg (3.25 g/kg) in the hamster, with 95% confidence interval 2.21-5.41 mL/kg (2.48-6.06 g/kg). Diethylene glycol in high dosage produces damage to the fetuses of pregnant Syrian hamsters. It is not known whether this is an indirect result of the maternal toxicity, which was observed even at the lowest dosage used, or is the effect of digol or of its metabolites on the conceptus."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Diethylene glycol was tested for prenatal toxicity after oral administration (gavage) to pregnant Himalayan rabbits. The substance was administered to 15 female rabbits per group by stomach tube in daily doses of 100, 400, or 1000 mg/kg body wt from Day 7 postinsemination (pi) through Day 19 pi. The control group received the vehicle only (twice distilled water). There were no compound-related effects on the dams concerning food consumption, body weight, body weight gain, or clinical or necropsy observations even at the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg body wt/day. All data obtained on gestational parameters also revealed no biologically relevant differences between the control and treated groups. The fetal external, soft tissue, and skeletal findings, which were classified as malformations, variations, and/or retardations, were seen in the treated fetuses at a frequency similar to the corresponding and/or historical controls. Thus, under the conditions of this study, no signs of maternal toxicity or embryo-/fetotoxicity were induced by diethylene glycol. Therefore, a no-observable-adverse-effect level for diethylene glycol of > 1000 mg/kg body wt/day was established for both the maternal and the developing Himalayan rabbit."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Diethylene glycol (DEG) ... was investigated in mice and rats, species known to be sensitive to the developmental toxicity of ethylene glycol. Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice and CD rats were dosed daily by gavage with undiluted DEG over gestational days (gd) 6-15. Based on probe studies, mouse dosages were 0 (distilled water), 559, 2795 and 11,180 mg/kg/day, and those for rats 0, 1118, 4472 and 8944 mg/kg/day. They were examined daily for clinical signs of toxicity, and body weights, food consumption and water consumption measured periodically throughout gestation. At necropsy, on gd 18 (mice) or gd 21 (rats), dams were examined for gross pathology and body, gravid uterus, liver and kidney weights were measured. Maternal rat kidneys were examined histologically. Fetuses were weighed, sex determined, and examined for external, visceral and skeletal variations and malformations. With mice there was maternal toxicity at 11,180 mg/kg/day (mortality, signs, increased water consumption) and at 2795 mg/kg/day (increased water consumption). Implantations were comparable across all groups. Fetal body weights were significantly reduced at 11,180 mg/kg/day. There were no increases in variations or malformations, either total, by category, or individually. With rats, maternal toxicity was present at 8944 mg/kg/day (mortality, signs, reduced body weight gain, reduced food consumption, increased water consumption, increased liver weight, increased kidney weight, and renal histopathology), and 4472 mg/kg/day (increased water consumption). There were no treatment-related effects on corpora lutea or implantations. Fetal body weights were reduced at 8944 mg/kg/day. There were no significant effects with respect to total or individual external or visceral variations. Individual skeletal variations were significantly increased at 8944 mg/kg/day (poorly ossified interparietal, poorly ossified thoracic centra number 10 and number 13, and bilobed thoracic centrum number 10) and 4472 mg/kg/day (split anterior arch of atlas and bilobed thoracic centrum number 10). This pattern of delayed ossification is consistent with reduced fetal body weight. Malformations, total, by category, or individually, were similar between the control and DEG groups. Thus, under the conditions of these studies, the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for DEG given by gavage over gd 6-15 was 559 mg/kg/day with the mouse and 1118 mg/kg/day with the rat for maternal toxicity, and 2795 mg/kg/day with mice and 1118 mg/kg/day with rats for developmental toxicity (fetotoxicity). There were no indications of embryotoxicity or teratogenic effects at any dosage in either species."
