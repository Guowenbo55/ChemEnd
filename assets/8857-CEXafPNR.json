Mice placed in inhalation chambers were exposed to aerosols containing one or more of the suspected components, including n-heptane, ethyl-acetate, fluororesin, silicone, and a commercial spray. An intermittent inhalation methods was used to prevent the solvents from causing anesthetic death. Mice were sacrificed 1 hour after the end of exposure. The lungs of both exposed and control mice were isolated and examined microscopically for any changes. The amounts released of the were similar. Mice exposed to the commercial and fluororesin sprays were cyanotic and depressed for 1 hour, while those exposed to the other sprays were cyanotic for only several minutes. In almost all mice exposed to the commercial spray, significant changes relative to the controls included a thickened pulmonary alveolar septa, cellular infiltration, fused and hemorrhaged alveolar walls, and diminished alveoli. Fluororesin particles were found in the alveolar space. Significantly more pronounced pathological changes were discovered in mice exposed to the fluororesin spray, relative to the commercial spray. In mice exposed to the silicone spray, significant differences were observed in alveolar collapse and hemorrhage, compared to the controls. The lungs of mice exposed to the N-heptane, ethyl-acetate, and fluororesin free sprays were similar to control lungs. In mice exposed to the silicon resin free spray, significant changes, relative to the commercial spray group, included alveolar collapse, hyperemia, hemorrhage and increased thickness and cellular infiltration of the septum. /It was/ concluded that ethyl-acetate and n-heptane contained in waterproofing sprays do not cause pulmonary disorders.

Ethyl and n-butyl acetate produced significant decreases in locomotor activity at the highest concentrations examined, while amyl acetate was without effect. Minimally effective concentrations for activity-decreasing effects were 2000 ppm for ethyl acetate and 8000 ppm for n-butyl acetate. The potency order was similar in the FOB where ethyl acetate was more potent in disrupting the neurobehavioral measures. The FOB profile of effects for all three acetates included changes in posture, decreased arousal, increased tonic/clonic movements, disturbances in gait, delayed righting reflexes, and increased sensorimotor reactivity. Furthermore, handling-induced convulsions were produced in some mice acutely exposed to each of these acetates. Recovery from the acute effects of these acetates was rapid and began within minutes of removal from the exposure chamber. The acetates produced a profile of neurobehavioral effects that were different from those reported for depressant solvents (i.e., toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane) that are subject to abuse. Evidence is emerging for qualitative differences in the acute neurobehavioral effects of various volatile chemicals."

Evaluation of the data indicated that male rats exposed to the high dose (3600 mg/kg/day) of ethyl acetate showed significant toxic effects, which resulted in depressed body and organ weights, and depressed food consumption. Female rats exposed to the high dose showed slight but nonsignificant depression of above parameters compared with controls. The next lower dose (900 mg/kg/day) did not produce any adverse effects in either male or female rats and is, therefore, considered a NOEL. By applying an uncertainty factor of 1000 to this NOEL of 900 mg/kg/day, an RfD of 0.9 mg/kg/day or 63 mg/day for a 70-kg person can be recommended."

Functional observational battery (FOB) and motor activity tests occurred on non-exposure days during weeks 4, 8 and 13, after which tissues were microscopically examined for neuropathology. A subset of rats was monitored during a 4-week recovery period. Exposure to 750 and 1500 ppm, diminished behavioral responses to unexpected auditory stimuli during the exposure session and appeared to be an acute sedative effect. There were no signs of acute intoxication 30 min after exposure sessions ended. Rats exposed to 750 and 1500 ppm had reduced body weight, body weight gain, feed consumption, and feed efficiency, which fully or partially recovered within 4 weeks. Reductions in body weight gain and feed efficiency were observed in male rats exposed to 350 ppm. The principal behavioral effect of subchronic exposure was reduced motor activity in the 1500 ppm females, an effect that was not present after the 4-week recovery period. All other FOB and motor activity parameters were unaffected, and no pathology was observed in nervous system tissues. Operant sessions were conducted in another set of male rats preconditioned to a stable operant baseline under a multiple fixed ratio-fixed interval (FR-FI) schedule of food reinforcement. FR response rate, FR post-reinforcement pause duration, and the pattern of FI responding were not affected during or after the exposure series. In contrast, within-group FI rate for the treatment groups increased over time whereas those of the controls decreased. A historical control group, however, also showed a similar pattern of increase, indicating that these changes did not clearly represent a treatment-related effect. Results from these studies indicate a LOEL of 350 ppm for systemic toxicity based on the decreased body weight gain in male rats, and a LOEL of 1500 ppm for neurotoxicity based on the transient reduction in motor activity in female rats. In conclusion, there was no evidence that subchronic exposure up to 1500 ppm ethyl acetate produced any enduring neurotoxic effects in rats."

It would then be possible to demonstrate EtOH accumulation following exposure to EtAc vapor. Preliminary studies showed that rat blood incubated at 37 \u00b0C does hydrolyze EtAc to EtOH, with a half-time of approximately 65 min. Analyses were done by gas chromatography. To study this reaction in vivo, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and cannulae were inserted into the femoral arteries. EtAc was injected ip as a 25% () solution in corn oil (1.6 g/kg) and blood samples were drawn periodically. Hydrolysis was very rapid in vivo, with a half-time estimated at 5-10 min. Inhalation studies were then carried out by exposing anesthetized rats to several concentrations of EtAc vapor via an endotracheal tube. When EtAc concentrations were increased above 2000 ppm, EtAc absorption exceeded EtOH oxidation, leading to an accumulation of EtOH in the blood. Although blood EtOH concentrations increased steadily to over 0.10 g/100 mL in 5 hr, EtAc remained consistently below 0.01 g/100 mL and did not change throughout the course of the experiment, again indicating rapid hydrolysis. The data indicate that EtOH will accumulate during exposure to EtAc if the ambient concentration of EtAc is sufficiently high."
