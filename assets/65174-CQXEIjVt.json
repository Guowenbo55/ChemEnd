However, its uptake and transport mechanisms in plants have not been well understood. This study used castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) seedlings as a model to investigate KSM's uptake and transport. The results indicated that KSM applied to cotyledons could be transported into the phloem and distributed in the root and shoot of the plant. Factors such as temperature, concentration, and pH significantly influenced KSM uptake, suggesting an active carrier system. Competitive inhibitors of sugar transporters (D-glucose, D-chiroinositol, and phloridzin) and energy inhibitors (dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone) also affected KSM uptake, indicating that KSM is transported by a sugar transporter. The study provides insights into plant-microbe interactions regarding the transport of microbial secondary metabolites in plants. This understanding is significant for the scientific application of antibiotics, biological control of plant diseases, and the development of bidirectional transport pesticides.",
