Verdc], along with translocation to emergent shoots, was measured over 24 and 48 hours. Uptake into submerged tissues of roots and stem base involved two processes: movement into the aqueous phase of cells and then partitioning onto the plant solids. This partitioning process was influenced by lipophilicity (measured by the l-octanol/water partition coefficient, Kow), resulting in higher uptake rates of more lipophilic compounds. Translocation to shoots was passive and most efficient at a log Kow of about 1.8, where the efficiency was about 40% of that of water. This optimal log Kow was similar to that observed in barley, although the translocation efficiency was slightly lower in parrot feather. Solvation parameters were used to model uptake and translocation of a set of ten compounds by barley, aiming to understand why translocation efficiency is reduced at log Kow > 1.8.",
