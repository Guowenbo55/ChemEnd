In the male rats, an increase in prothrombin time and a reduction in total protein occurs at higher concentrations. ... Following inhalation of 25,000 ppm (59.3 mg/L), atrophy in the region of the olfactory epithelium is observed on histological examination of the nasal mucosae. No other histopathological changes are observed. In the 28-day inhalation study, 1500 ppm (3.6 mg/L) is given as the no effect level for male rats and 3500 ppm (8.3 mg/L) for female rats."

Mutagenicity tests of 14 compounds and 1,3-butadiene on S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA were also examined by the developed gas exposure method. 1,3-Butadiene, propyne (methyl acetylene), monochlorodifluoromethane, ethylchloride, diborane and silane were mutagenic. 1-Butene, 2-butene, 2-methylpropene, methyl vinyl ether, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane and phosphine were not mutagenic on S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA with or without metabolic activation. These results were compatible with a previous report, and this developed method has the advantage that it can be tested easily and safely for combustible and self-combustible substances such as 1,3-butadiene and silane."
