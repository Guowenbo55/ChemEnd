More clopyralid was transported to the lower canopy from application of the monoethanolamine salt and potassium salt than the 2-ethylhexyl ester of clopyralid at 4 h or 1, 3, or 8 days after treatment. Application of the monoethanolamine salt and the 2-ethylhexyl ester to leaves with a pipet indicated that about twice as much clopyralid was absorbed within 15 min from the ester form (26%) than from the amine form (12%) of the total recovered. However, after 24 h, absorption of the ester was less than the amine. More than twice as much clopyralid was transported from the treated leaf after application of amine than the ester. Only the acid form of clopyralid was transported away from the site of application of either ester or amine.",

Plants were grown under a 35% or 65% RH regime in silica sand maintained at 33% w/w moisture or under a water stress regime at 65% RH. Approxi mately 26,39,86,93 and 100% of the applied 14C-activity from the 2-ethylhexyl ester, acid, monoethanolamine salt, 1-decyl ester and potas sium salt, respectively, were recovered 72 h after application to glass cover slips placed in the growth room. However, loss of applied 14C-activity after application of the five formulations to both plant species was significant only for the 2-ethylhexyl ester. Regardless of environmental regime, the acid was the most readily absorbed formulation. In contrast to the acid, the salts and esters were less readily absorbed. When the data were expressed as a percentage of absorbed radioactivity, there was no significant difference in translocation when the acid, monoethanolamine salt and potassium salt were compared. However, significantly smaller quantities of the absorbed 2-ethylhexyl and 1-decyl ester were exported from the treated leaf. These results indicate that once absorbed, the esters do not readily partition out of the cuticle, whereas the acid and two salts move into the symplast for subsequent translocation. When the results of the three environmental regimes were compared, the absorption of the monoethanolamine and potas sium salts were greatly reduced under low humi dity or water stress, whereas the acid and esters were not affected.",
