In the Lakeland soil sample with higher organic matter content, the concentration was reduced from 1.01 ppm to 0.65 after 1 week and 0.33 ppm after 8 weeks(1). In the Leon soil sample with lower organic matter content, bromopropylate was degraded more slowly from an initial concentration of 1.12 ppm to 0.99 after 1 week and 0.47 after 8 weeks(1). Half-lives of bromopropylate in Lakeland soil were 2.5, 8, and 12 weeks at bromopropylate concentrations of 1.0, 0.6, and 0.3 ppm, respectively(1). Half-lives of bromopropylate in Leon soil were 4, 13, and 12 weeks at bromopropylate concentrations of 1.0, 0.6, and 0.3 ppm, respectively(1)."

In tests in Rhodesia in which experimental plots were treated 19 times at intervals of about six days, the yields of seed cotton were significantly higher from plots receiving 0.075% bromopropylate or 0.25% Milbex [which contains chlorfensulphide and chlorfenethol] than from those receiving 0.1% binapacryl; sprays of dimethoate and thiometon did not result in increased yields."
