It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a herbicide. It is a member of phenols, a dibromobenzene and a hydroxynitrile. It is functionally related to a 2,6-dibromophenol. It is a conjugate acid of a 3,5-dibromo-4-oxidobenzonitrile(1-).",

The major biodegradation products in soil are 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzamide(3,4). Bromoxynil biodegraded in a clay loam soil of high organic content, but not in sterilized soil(4). The half-life in the non-sterile soil was 7 days. In a laboratory experiment, when bromoxynil octanoate was applied to heavy clay (organic content 4.2%, pH 7.7) and sandy loam (organic content 4.0%, pH 7.6) soils (at 85% field capacity moisture) at a rate equivalent of 1 kg bromoxynil/ha, it was rapidly hydrolyzed to the free bromoxynil (80% in 24 hr). The bromoxynil formed was rapidly degraded with as much as 30% breakdown in 24 hr and complete breakdown in 7 days(1). The presence of several other pesticides did not affect the degradation(1). A second study performed in Regina heavy clay at a higher concentration found that after 1 and 2 weeks of incubation at 18 \u00b0C, 47-75% and 38-66% of bromoxynil remained in the soil(5). The amounts of bromoxynil remaining after incubation at 25 \u00b0C were 25-54% and 9-36%, respectively(5)."

Anaerobic biodegradation proceeds via reductive debromination to 4-cyanophenol which is further degraded to phenol and ultimately carbon dioxide(1). Dehalogenation of bromoxynil to 4-cyanophenol and 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoate by the soil microbe Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans, an anaerobic spore-forming microorganism, has been demonstrated(2)."

Nugaines), a resistant species, and coast fiddleneck (Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. & Mey.), a susceptible species, was examined. Radioautographic and extraction analysis revealed that the label from 14C-bromoxynil was more mobile in coast fiddleneck than in wheat. Higher levels of soluble radioactivity were found in extracts of coast fiddleneck than wheat. Higher levels of insoluble label were found in tissue residues of wheat than coast fiddleneck. In both species, most of the activity remained in treated leaves. A high percentage of the soluble activity was attributed to 14C-bromoxynil in both wheat and coast fiddleneck. The evolution of 14CO2 by wheat treated with 14C-bromoxynil significantly exceeded that of coast fiddleneck. The difference in susceptibility between winter wheat and coast fiddleneck appears to be explained partly by differential translocation and degradation of bromoxynil.",

Bromoxynil controlled common lambsquarters similarly regardless of water volume, whereas injury to spearmint, a tolerant crop, was greatest using low water volume.

Two weeks after applying bromoxynil in 127 000 L ha\u22121 water volume, common lambsquarters dry weight was 60% of the nontreated check where only soil was treated but was 5% of the nontreated check where only leaves were treated. Roots of lambsquarters absorbed 22% of 14C-bromoxynil applied to hydroponic solution by 7 d, but only 2% was translocated to the shoots.
