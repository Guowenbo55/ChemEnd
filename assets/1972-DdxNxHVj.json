            "Value": "Amphotericin B usually is fungistatic in action at concentrations obtained clinically, but may be fungicidal in high concentrations or against very susceptible organisms. Amphotericin B exerts its antifungal activity principally by binding to sterols (e.g., ergosterol) in the fungal cell membrane. As a result of this binding, the cell membrane is no longer able to function as a selective barrier and leakage of intracellular contents occurs. Cell death occurs in part as a result of permeability changes, but other mechanisms also may contribute to the in vivo antifungal effects of amphotericin B against some fungi. Amphotericin B is not active in vitro against organisms that do not contain sterols in their cell membranes (eg, bacteria)."

            "Value": "Binding to sterols in mammalian cells (such as certain kidney cells and erythrocytes) may account for some of the toxicities reported with conventional amphotericin B therapy. At usual therapeutic concentrations of amphotericin B, the drug does not appear to hemolyze mature erythrocytes, and the anemia seen with conventional IV amphotericin B therapy may result from the action of the drug on actively metabolizing and dividing erythropoietic cells."

            "Value": "...Nephrotoxicity associated with conventional IV amphotericin B appears to involve several mechanisms, including a direct vasoconstrictive effect on renal arterioles that reduces glomerular and renal tubular blood flow and a lytic action on cholesterol-rich lysosomal membranes of renal tubular cells. ..."
