    "Description": "Traseolide is an indane derivative in which the indane skeleton is substituted by geminal methyl groups at C-1, by single methyl groups at C-2 and C-6, by an isopropyl group at C-3 and by an acetyl group at C-6. It is a constituent of musk odorant. It has a role as an odorant receptor agonist and a fragrance. It is a member of indanes, a methyl ketone and an aromatic ketone.",

Namayvush) from remote alpine lakes in the Grisons, Switzerland(3). Musk xylene (which includes traseolide), was present at an average concentration of 12.0, 0.72 and 0.44 ug/kg fresh weight in trout from 34 Danish fish farms sampled in 1992, 1999 and 2003, respectively(4). Traseolide was reported at concentrations ranging from <2.2 to 16 ug/kg lipid weight in brown trout (Salmo trutta fario L.) from the Prachatice, Brohl and Pacov streams, Czech Republic. Fish were collected upstream and downstream from sewage treatment plants in 2009(4)."

ADBI, HHCB and AHTN were detected in almost all samples, while AHMI, ATII and DPMI were not detected. Concentrations of ADBI, HHCB and AHTN in mussels ranged from below detection limit-0.0743 (mean: 0.0246), 0.247-6.08 (mean: 1.15) and 0.0591-0.738 (mean: 0.190)mg/kg lipid weight, respectively. Mussels from two sampling sites in central Victoria Harbour contained the highest total polycyclic musk levels, suggesting that these waters are influenced heavily by domestic sewage. Concentrations of HHCB and AHTN detected in the mussel samples were the second highest and the highest levels, respectively, compared to global concentrations. A preliminary risk assessment indicated that HHCB and AHTN in mussels pose little or no threat to the health of shellfish consumers. Nevertheless, more comprehensive studies are required to further assess the ecological and human health risks associated with polycyclic musks."
