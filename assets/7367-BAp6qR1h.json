    "Description": "(trichloromethyl)benzene is an organochlorine compound that is toluene in which all three hydrogens of the methyl group have been replaced by chlorines. It is used as an intermediate in organic synthesis and dye chemistry. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent. It is a member of benzenes, a volatile organic compound and an organochlorine compound.",

According to a recommended classification scheme(3), this BCF value suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms will be an important fate process(SRC). However, due to the rapid hydrolysis of benzotrichloride in water(4-6), bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is not expected to occur(SRC)."

According to a recommended classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that benzotrichloride has slight mobility in soil(SRC). Due to the rapid hydrolysis of benzotrichloride in water(3-5), leaching in moist soils should not be significant due to its degradation to benzoic and hydrochloric acid(SRC)."
