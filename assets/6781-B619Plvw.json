Diethyl phthalate was found to degrade to ethyl methyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, methyl phthalate and ethyl phthalate when co-contaminated with methanol(2).

Diethyl phthalate was completely degraded by Rhine River water at 20 \u00b0C in a 3 day die-away test(4). Diethyl phthalate was 87-92% degraded in 10-50 days at 25 \u00b0C from a concn of 100 mg/L using 30 mg/L activated sludge(5). Electrolytic respirometer studies have shown that diethyl phthalate is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions(6-8). Diethyl phthalate had aerobic aquatic half-lives of 0.39 days in a river die-away test, 4.33 days in MITI test, and 0.71 days using microcosm periphlton, and an aerobic soil half-life of 1.83 days agitated in aqueous suspension(9)."

Diethyl phthalate was partially degraded in ground water at 10 \u00b0C(2). A pseudo-first order anaerobic biodegradation rate constant of 0.006/hr was measured for diethyl phthalate using microbial cultures isolated from a municipal waste sludge; this rate constant corresponds to a half-life of about 5 days(3). Under anaerobic conditions, 250 mg/L of diethyl phthalate was degraded in approximately 450 hours(4). Enriched microbial cultures isolated from a wastewater treatment facility resulted in complete degradation of a 20 mg/L sample of diethyl phthalate in 26 days under anaerobic conditions, while a 100 mg/L sample resulted in 5% degradation and a 200 mg/L sample had 3% degradation in 26 days(5). Anaerobic degradation of diethyl phthalate in aging phases of landfills were; 20-25% in 80 days of the first stage, 40% in 278 days in stable methane production stage and 100% anaerobic degradation in 60-80 days in municipal solid waste samples(6).

Additional groups of five rats of each sex were fed similar diets for 2 or 6 weeks. No significant effects on hematology, serum enzyme levels, or urinary examinations were detected. Significant decreases in body weight gain were observed in the 5.0% groups of both sexes at 2, 6, or 16 weeks (23-32% for males, 15-20% for females) and in the 1.0% group of females at 16 weeks (8%). A concurrent paired-feeding experiment indicated that the decrease in body weight gain was primarily attributable to lower food consumption and/or poorer food utilization, rather than to a direct toxic action of diethyl phthalate. There were over 30% increases in relative liver weight at the highest dose groups of both sexes in all treatment periods (2, 6, and 16 weeks). The increases in relative liver weight of females at all doses in the 16-week study were significant and dose-dependent. Similar effects were detected in relative organ weights of stomach and small intestine. Relative weights of kidney were also significantly increased at the highest dose only in the 16-week study (18% for males and 11% for females). However, there were no abnormal histopathological findings in the liver, kidney, digestive organs, or any other organs. Although the authors postulate the 1.0% dose as a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL), based on the decrease in body weight, the magnitude of the body weight change at the 1.0% dose was much smaller than that at the 5.0% dose, and the change was primarily due to a decrease in food consumption, as described above. Therefore, the dose of 1.0% (750 mg/kg body weight per day) is considered to be the NOAEL."

No effects on hematological or blood clinical chemistry parameters and no dermatotoxicological lesions (including neoplasms and non-neoplastic lesions) were observed in both sexes. An increased incidence of non-neoplastic proliferative lesions (basophilic foci) in the liver was statistically significant at the 15 uL dose in males, but not females. Dose-related trends (incidence in order from low to high dose: 0/50, 1/50, 9/50, 3/50 in males and 2/50, 3/50, 6/50, 2/50 in females) were not apparent. The incidences of combined hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in the male mice dosed with 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 uL/day were 9/50, 14/50, 14/50, and 18/50, respectively; the corresponding incidences in the female mice were 7/50, 16/51, 19/50, and 12/50, respectively. The combined tumor incidence was dose-related in males only (the dose-related trend by the logistic regression test had a P value of 0.040 in males and 0.231 in females). The authors considered that there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity in both sexes of mice, because there was no dose-related response in females and an unusually low control incidence compared with historical data. However, considering that oral administration of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate induced the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma in mice and diethyl phthalate showed a weak potential for peroxisome proliferation, this positive trend of the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in male mice by diethyl phthalate may be related to the peroxisome proliferation activity."

The F0 mice were fed diets containing the test compound at concentrations of 0, 325, 1,625, or 3,250 mg/kg daily during premating, mating, gestation, and lactation; the F1 generation animals received 0 or 3,250 mg/kg/day on the same regimen.

Sensitization was evaluated as ear swelling after a challenge with FITC. Draining lymph node cells obtained 24 hr after skin sensitization were examined for FITC fluorescence by means of flow cytometry. FITC-positive cells were characterized with anti-CD11c and anti-CD11b by three-colour flow cytometry. ... : When mice were sensitized with FITC in acetone containing di-butyl phthalate (DBP) or di-n-propyl phthalate (DPP), strong enhancement of the ear-swelling response was observed. Di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) were less effective but produced some enhancement. Consistent enhancement was not observed with di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate or di-isononyl phthalate. Upon sensitization in the presence of DBP or DPP, the number of FITC-positive dendritic cells (total CD11c+ as well as CD11c+/CD11b+) was increased in draining lymph nodes. As to the other four phthalate esters, there was no significant increase in the FITC-positive cell number in the draining lymph nodes. /It was concluded that/ ...during the process of sensitization to FITC, DBP, and DPP exert strong adjuvant effects that are associated with enhancement of trafficking of antigen-presenting dendritic cells from the skin to draining lymph nodes."

The expression of CaBP-9k in the uterus of immature rats /was investigated/ after oral treatment with butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP+, or di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) (600 mg/kg per day) in this in vivo model, because the immature rat model is highly sensitive to exposure to estrogenic chemicals. None of the phthalates induced the expression of Calbindin-D9k CaBP-9k mRNA and its protein in the neonatal uterus as analysed by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Although phthalates induced an increase in MCF-7 cell proliferation by an estrogenic effect, they could not induce CaBP-9k expression in the in vivo system."

            "Value": "A Koc value of diethyl phthalate of 1,726 was measured in podzol soil at pH 2.8 and 4.85% carbon, a value of 704 in alfisol soil at pH 6.7 and 1.25% carbon, a value of 320 in sediment at pH 7.1 and 1.58% carbon(1). An experimental log Koc of 1.99 was determined from unsaturated soil columns at pH 4.8(2). A Koc value of 69 was determined from measurements on soil samples from Broome County, NY(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that diethyl phthalate is expected to have low to high mobility in soil."
