A fungicide effective against a broad spectrum of diseases in fruit, vegetables, turf and other crops including eyespot, scab, powdery mildew and grey mould. It has a role as an antifungal drug. It is a member of thioureas, a carbamate ester, a benzimidazole precursor fungicide and a carbamate fungicide. It is functionally related to a 1,2-phenylenediamine.",

The fungicides included the major degradation product of benomyl (MBC) methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate and thiophanate-methyl [dimethyl 4,4'-o-phenylene bis(3-thioalophanate)]. Translocation of the four compounds was related to the total root-absorbed activity in a complete nutrient solution.",
