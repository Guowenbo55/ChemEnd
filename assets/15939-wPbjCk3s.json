The objectives of this study were to determine the specific role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the process. Acute lung injury was induced by administering paraquat (PQ) intraperitoneally. NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression in lung tissue and IL-1beta and IL-18 levels in BALF were detected at 4, 8, 24, and 72 hr after PQ administration in rats. Moreover, rats were pretreated with 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide, respectively, 1 h before PQ exposure. At 72 hr after PQ administration, lung histopathology changes, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 protein expression, as well as secretion of cytokines including IL-1beta and IL-18 in BALF were investigated. The NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 expression, and cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 levels in PQ poisoning rats were significantly higher than that in the control group. NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide pretreatment attenuated lung edema, inhibited the NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 activation, and reduced IL-1beta and IL-18 levels in BALF. In the in vitro experiments, IL-1beta and IL-18 secreted from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages treated with paraquat were attenuated by glybenclamide. In conclusion, paraquat can induce IL-1beta/IL-18 secretion via NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 pathway, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for paraquat-induced acute lung injury."

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We demonstrated that PQ injures mitochondria and leads to mtDNA release. The mtDNA mediated PBMC recruitment and stimulated the alveolar epithelial cell production of TGF-beta1 in vitro. The levels of mtDNA in circulation and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were elevated in a mouse of PQ-induced lung injury. DNaseI could protect PQ-induced lung injury and significantly improved survival. Acute lung injury markers, such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, and marker of fibrosis, collagen I, were downregulated in parallel with the elimination of mtDNA by DNaseI. These data indicate a possible mechanism for PQ-induced, mtDNA-mediated lung injury, which may be shared by other causes of lung injury, as suggested by the same protective effect of DNaseI in bleomycin-induced lung injury model. Interestingly, increased mtDNA in the BALF of patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis-interstitial lung disease can be appreciated.  CONCLUSIONS: DNaseI targeting mtDNA may be a promising approach for the treatment of PQ-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis that merits fast tracking through clinical trials."

            "Value": "Paraquat (PQ), one of the most widely used herbicides, has been used for several decades in agriculture. Some studies suggest that PQ has effects on the immune system. Moreover, previous studies have shown that PQ imparted some immunosuppressive effects. In the present study, cytotoxicity assays using splenic NK cells from mice treated for 28 days with PQ (at 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg) were performed to determine whether PQ altered the function of NK cells. Given that PQ was expected to induce an immunosuppressive effect, it was hypothesized that a gene involved in cellular metal ion homeostasis, metallothionein-1 (MT-1), could play an important role in this outcome. This belief was based on the fact that MT1 encodes a protein responsible for zinc ion homeostasis, and that a reduction in free zinc ion levels impairs NK cell function. The results showed that PQ treatments led to increased MT expression in several organs (liver, kidneys, testes) and in splenocytes, caused a reduction of both free zinc ions in sera and in free intracellular zinc, and reduced the expression of GATA-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor important for maturation and activity of T-cells and NK cells. These results provide a basis for a new molecular mechanism to describe potential immunosuppressive effects of PQ in vivo."

Outer membrane extract oxidized NADH in a PQ dose-dependent manner, and oxidation was suppressed by VDAC inhibitors. Zymographic analysis revealed the presence of VDAC1 protein in the oxidoreductase, and the direct binding of PQ to VDAC1 was demonstrated using biotinylated PQ.

In this study, PQ-induced cytotoxicity focusing on mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP), which has been implicated to play a part in neurodegeneration, was investigated. Primarily, PQ-induced cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were inhibited by an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX), indicating the toxic effect of PQ redox cycling. Further, dibucaine and cyclosporin A which respectively inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channels (MAC) and mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP) were used and found to prevent PQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, such as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased MMP, mitochondrial ROS, and pro-apoptotic factor release. Knockdown of bax and/or bak blocked PQ-induced mitochondrial clusterization of Bax and/or Bak and cytotoxicity, demonstrating the significance of MAC which is composed of Bax and/or Bak. This clusterization coincided with the release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors before there was an increase in inner MMP, indicating that MAC may precede mPTP formation. Besides, NOX inhibitor but not dibucaine attenuated the earlier PQ-induced cytosolic ROS formation or Bax and/or Bak clusterization indicating PQ redox cycling may account for MAC formation. In this model, we have resolved for the first that PQ cytotoxicity through redox cycling may sequentially result in increased outer (MAC) and inner (mPTP) MMP and suggested MMP could be implicated as a therapeutic target in treating neurodegenerative diseases like PD."

Following PQ treatment, EMT induction was observed under microscopy. Related fibrosis genes, including Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), collagens type I (COL I), and type III (COL III), were also evaluated by measuring their mRNA levels using RT-PCR analysis. Signaling pathways were analyzed using selective pharmacological inhibitors for MAPK. Cell migration ability was evaluated by scratch wound and Transwell assays. The data showed that PQ-induced epithelial RLE-6NT cells to develop mesenchymal cell characteristics, as indicated by a significant decrease in the epithelial marker E-cadherin and a significant increase in the extracellular matrix (ECM) marker alpha-smooth muscle actin in a dose and time-dependent manner. Moreover, PQ-treated RLE-6NT cells had an EMT-like phenotype with elevated expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and COL I and COL III and enhanced migration ability. Signal pathway analysis revealed that PQ-induced EMT led to ERK-1 and Smad2 phosphorylation through activation of the MAPK pathway. The results of the current study indicate that PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis occurs via EMT, which is mediated by the MAPK pathway.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been proposed as a key determinant in the development of lung fibrosis. We investigated thus whether knock down of CTGF can prevent human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) activation and proliferation with the subsequent inhibition of PQ-induced fibrosis. MRC-5 was transfected with CTGF-siRNAs and exposed to different concentrations of PQ. The siRNA-silencing efficacy was evaluated using western blotting analyses, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Next, the viability and migration of MRC-5 was determined. MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 accumulation were quantified to evaluate the lung fibrosis exposure to PQ. Over expression of CTGF mRNA was observed in human MRC-5 cell as early as 6 h following PQ stimulation. CTGF gene expression in MRC-5 cells was substantially reduced by RNAi, which significantly suppressed the expression of the lung fibrosis markers such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) that were stimulated by PQ. Inhibition of CTGF expression suppressed impeded the proliferation and migration ability of MRC-5 cells and resulted in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) protein accumulation in cells. Our results suggest that CTGF promoted the development of PQ-induced lung fibrosis in collaboration with transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1). Furthermore, the observed arresting effects of CTGF knock down during this process suggested that CTGF is the potential target site for preventing PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

However, some leaching of paraquat may occur under conditions that are favorable for soil colloid formation (eg, with water of low electrolytic conductivity)(10). In such cases, passage of soil colloids containing adsorbed paraquat through soil pores may account for the transport of paraquat(10). Paraquat is strongly adsorbed from aquatic phase to suspended solids and sediments in water(11). Fifteen computer models (based on LEACHM and various experimental parameters) were applied to the Morgan Creek watershed (Chesapeake Bay area) and predicted that 0.00% of applied paraquat would be leached to groundwater(5)."

            "Value": "Double positively charged paraquat cation may react with clay minerals in soil by forming complexes with the negatively charged sites on the clay minerals(1-3). Paraquat may also be adsorbed in soil by forming complexes with humic and fulvic materials present in soil(3-5). Therefore, adsorption of paraquat to soil will generally increase with the increase in clay and organic content of soil(SRC)."

            "Value": "Paraquat was found to have high Freundlich adsorption distribution coefficients (28.7 and 1419) using Malaysian muck and sandy loam soils, respectively, that correspond to Koc values of 2207 and 4652(1); desorption studies observed negligible paraquat desorption from the muck soil and very low desorption from the sandy loam (0-0.42%)(1); soil column leaching studies found that paraquat leaching was not evident in either the sandy loam or muck soil(1). Using a dialysis technique to measure sorption and desorption to humic acid fractions extracted from soil, paraquat was rapidly adsorbed (nearly complete in 2-4 hours) with no to very low desorption over a 24-hr period(2). In sorption-desorption studies using two vineyard soils from Spain, paraquat exhibited very strong adsorption (Kd partition coefficient of 106-1280) with very small desorption(3). Paraquat has a very low soil leaching potential (5 on a scale of 100) and has a low groundwater contamination potential rating with respect to North Carolina soils and groundwaters(4). A soil column leaching study using a surface layer fine sand soil (1.3% organic carbon) and a subsurface layer fine sand (0.1% organic carbon) found a surface layer Koc of 24,441 with very slow desorption in both soils(5)."

            "content": "Resistance to paraquat has been extensively studied in various weed species for over a decade, yet the precise mechanism behind this resistance remains unclear. Several studies suggest that reduced movement of the herbicide to the site of action in the chloroplast is partially responsible for this resistance. Despite previous studies on paraquat translocation, few have been conducted on whole plants in light, even though early observations indicated minimal paraquat translocation unless treated plants were exposed to light. This study focused on Arctotheca calendula, comparing the movement of 14C-paraquat in resistant and susceptible plants under both dark and light conditions. Differences in paraquat translocation were only observed between the resistant and susceptible biotypes when plants were exposed to light. Specifically, paraquat translocation was significantly reduced in the resistant biotype compared to the susceptible biotype under light exposure, but not in the dark. The study suggests that paraquat translocation is dependent on light-mediated damage. Since paraquat-induced damage is less severe in resistant plants, overall paraquat translocation is reduced in the resistant biotype.",
