            "content": "In recent years, common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) populations from sugar beet fields in different European countries have shown resistance to the as-triazinone metamitron, with the same D1 point mutation (Ser264 to Gly) as atrazine-resistant biotypes. However, pot experiments have indicated that metamitron resistance is not as straightforward as observed with triazine resistance in the past. This study aimed to clarify the absorption, translocation, and metabolic fate of metamitron in C. album. Results from root absorption and foliar absorption experiments showed minor differences in absorption, translocation, and metabolism of metamitron between susceptible and resistant C. album populations. Rapid metabolism of metamitron was observed in C. album populations when absorbed by the roots. The primary products of metamitron metabolism were identified as deamino-metamitron and metamitron-N-glucoside. PABA, known to inhibit the deamination of metribuzin, did not alter the metabolism of metamitron, nor did the cytochrome P450 inhibitor PBO. However, the presence of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ABT demonstrated inhibition of metamitron metabolism.",
