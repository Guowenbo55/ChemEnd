ADBI, HHCB and AHTN were detected in almost all samples, while AHMI, ATII and DPMI were not detected. Concentrations of ADBI, HHCB and AHTN in mussels ranged from below detection limit-0.0743 (mean: 0.0246), 0.247-6.08 (mean: 1.15) and 0.0591-0.738 (mean: 0.190)mg/kg lipid weight, respectively. Mussels from two sampling sites in central Victoria Harbour contained the highest total polycyclic musk levels, suggesting that these waters are heavily influenced by domestic sewage. Concentrations of HHCB and AHTN detected in the mussel samples were the second highest and the highest levels, respectively, compared to global concentrations. A preliminary risk assessment indicated that HHCB and AHTN in mussels pose little or no threat to the health of shellfish consumers. Nevertheless, more comprehensive studies are required to further assess the ecological and human health risks associated with polycyclic musks."

This study investigated the concentrations and distribution of SMs in the Jiaozhou Bay wetland, including celestolide, phantolide, traseolide, galaxolide (HHCB), tonalide (AHTN), musk xylene and musk ketone (MK). The SMs HHCB, AHTN and MK were detected at concentrations of 10.7-208, not detected (ND)-59.2 and ND-13.6 ng/L, respectively, in surface water samples and 13.1-27.3, 3.06-14.5 and 1.33-18.8 ng/g (dry weight; dw), respectively, in sediment samples. Based on the calculated total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, there was no significant correlation between SMs and TOC in sediment samples (p?>?0.05). The hazard quotients were 0.204, 0.386 and 0.059 for AHTN, HHCB and MK, respectively, which indicated no serious environmental impact, because these values are all less than 1. The concentrations of SMs decreased as the distance to the Xiaojianxi refuse landfill increased in both surface water and sediments. Compared with previous studies, the concentration of SMs in the Jiaozhou Bay wetland was relatively high. Therefore, more attention should be paid to SMs because of their persistent impact on human health and the environment."
