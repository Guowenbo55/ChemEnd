Three experiments were conducted in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system and two experiments without activation. The dose levels tested in these experiments ranged from 0-5000 ug/ml. No significant increase in toxicity or in mutant frequency was observed at any dose level up to the highest dose tested (5000 ug/ml). Thus, sucrose was negative in these tests and the highest ineffective dose tested was 5000 ug/ml."

Molassed sugar-beet pulp, which has a high betaine content, can lead to the production of trimethylamine and consequent milk taint. Horses have been said to be particularly susceptible to sugar-beet poisoning. Affected animals develop clinical signs, including restlessness, cold extremities, neighing, salivation and inability to swallow food or water."

Sucrose was not carcinogenic, but showed tumor promoting activity in female Swiss albino mice after 18 months as 10% of a standard diet or when injected into the nape of the neck of rats and mice, 3 times/week for up to two years. The National Research Council concluded that epidemiologic and experimental evidence for carbohydrates (including sucrose) carcinogenesis was too sparse to implicate this class of compounds as having a direct role in carcinogenesis."

The initial clinical signs of toxicity were hypokinesia, prostration, cyanosis, clonic-tonic convulsions, abdominal bloating, and diarrhea. Sublethal doses for 1-to 3-day exposures produced anorexia, polydipsia, hypothermia, diarrhea, and weight loss. Death is the result of respiratory failure."

Translocation of radioactivity in the different plant parts varied among biotypes. Translocation in the whole plant after treatment with the three 14C-chemicals varied among biotypes but was not correlated with their tolerance to herbicides. Detailed analysis of distribution of radioactivity in the primary rhizome showed that more 14C was found in the apical sections after treatment with 14C-sucrose. A similar pattern was observed after 14C-glyphosate application with all biotypes except one. Very low radioactivity was found in rhizomes after 14C-quizalofop application, but a preferential accumulation in apical sections of the primary rhizome was detected in two biotypes. The tolerance of one biotype to glyphosate was explained by the absence of radioactivity accumulation in the apical sections of the rhizome.",
