Intravenous injections of benzoic acid increased plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations in a dose-dependent manner between 39-1250 umol/kg, with ED50s for increasing both hormones of about 625 umol/kg. Various derivatives of benzoic acid (625 umol/kg) were administered and structure-activity relationships were examined. A single carboxylic group was essential for stimulating insulin and glucagon secretion, since both hormone responses were abolished with compounds in which the carboxylic group was replaced by sulfonic or phosphoric groups, or in which another carboxylic element was introduced (phthalic acids). Most of the compounds which introduced other elements (amino and hydroxy groups, and halogens) onto the benzene ring had an altered stimulating activity. Thus the pancreatic endocrine system can recognize the chemical structure of benzoic acid and its derivatives in detail and induce insulin and glucagon secretion in sheep."

An experimental log Koc of 1.50 (Koc = 31) has been reported, test details not available(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that benzoic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of benzoic acid is 4.20(5), indicating that this compound will exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(6). Freundlich adsorption constants of 0.23, 0 and 0 were reported using Ersum sandy till (pH 4.7; 0.25% OC), Tirstrup melt water sand (pH 6.1; 0.09% OC) and Djursland clayey till (pH 7.6; 0.22% OC), respectively, at 6 \u00b0C.

Within treated leaves, radioactivity from benzoic acid showed movement out of the leaf along vascular bundles like 2,4-D, but also diffuse movement away from treated areas to all parts of the treated leaf. Further studies involving extraction and chromatography indicated that the bulk of the translocated radioactivity was in the form of free benzoic acid or dissociable salts of benzoic acid. Therefore, benzoic acid was observed to be both systemically translocated through the vascular system and transported diffusely within leaves after topical application to bean plants, primarily in its free acid form or as dissociable salts, with absorption and translocation enhanced under warmer and more humid conditions.",
