    "Description": "Tetradifon is a sulfone that is diphenylsulfone in which one of the phenyl groups is substituted by chlorine at position 4, while the other is substituted by a chlorine at positions 2, 4, and 5. It is an organochlorine acaricide, a trichlorobenzene, a sulfone and a member of monochlorobenzenes.",
