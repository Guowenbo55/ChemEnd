Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, measured in F344 rats 24 hr postexposure, was dramatically elevated following doses of 1.8-5.4 mmol/kg of o-DCB. Conversely, equimolar doses of p-DCB produced no such toxicity, while m-DCB produced intermediate hepatic injury at or above doses of 2.7 mmol/kg. Histopathological changes in livers from treated animals qualitatively reflected elevations in 24 hr plasma ALT activity (time to maximal elevation). Phenobarbital pretreatment potentiated the acute hepatotoxicity of o- and m-DCB, but did not affect the toxicity of p-DCB. Likewise, SKF-525A pretreatment inhibited the hepatotoxicity of o-DCB. Equimolar doses of o- and m-DCB produced approximately equivalent depletion of intrahepatic glutathione, while p-DCB had no effect on hepatic GSH. Furthermore, prior depletion of hepatic glutathione by pretreatment with phorone markedly potentiated the hepatotoxicity of o- and m-DCB, while increasing the toxicity of p-DCB to a far lesser degree. The differential hepatotoxicity of the o- and m-DCB does not appear to be explained adequately by differences in their hepatic distribution or in vivo covalent binding to hepatic proteins. Interestingly, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are relatively refractive to the acute hepatotoxicity of o-DCB following ip administration of 1.8 and 5.4 mmol/kg. The combination of these dramatic differences (structure- activity and animal strains) should be useful in elucidating key events involved in the hepatotoxicity caused by these compounds."

The highest doses of o-, m-, and p-DCB administered, 300, 300, and 1800 mg/kg, respectively, are below the lethal range. Acute hepatic injury was assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and hepatic histology. Hepatocyte replication was estimated by means of immunohistochemical demonstration of BrdU-labeled cells. Both o-DCB and m-DCB at a dose of 300 mg/kg produced significant elevations of liver weight and ALT activity as well as extensive liver cell necrosis. In contrast, p-DCB at a highest dose of 1800 mg/kg induced slight hepatocyte injury. Dose-response studies indicated that the rank order for acute hepatotoxicity of the isomers was m-DCB > o-DCB >/= p-DCB. However, p-DCB induced hepatocyte cell proliferation in spite of the lack of manifest hepatotoxicity. In contrast, increases of cell proliferation due to o-or m-DCB exposure occurred only after dosages that caused hepatic injury. These data suggest the hepatocyte proliferation induced by o- or m-DCB is compensatory regeneration while that induced by p-DCB is a response to mitogenic stimulation."

The two highest rat and both mouse dose levels were the same as those employed in a NTP bioassay, where DCB produced kidney tumors in male rats and liver tumors in mice. DCB produced significant dose-related increases in relative liver weight in both the rat and the mouse which was associated with, respectively, mild and marked centrilobular hypertrophy. Administration of DCB also produced a sustained induction of microsomal cytochrome P450 content and 7-pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase activity in both species. Western immunoblotting studies demonstrated that DCB induced CYP2B isoenzyme(s) in both rat and mouse liver microsomes. Replicative DNA synthesis was studied by implanting osmotic pumps containing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in study Weeks 0-1, 3-4, and 12-13. In the rat hepatocyte labeling index values were only increased in animals given 300 mg/kg DCB for 1 week, whereas hepatocyte labeling index values were significantly increased in mice given 300 and 600 mg/kg DCB for 1 and 4 weeks. DCB treatment produced significant increases in rat renal P1/P2 proximal tubule cell labeling index values at all time points, whereas little effect was observed in mouse kidney. The observed species difference in DCB-induced liver tumor formation may reflect the greater sensitivity of the mouse to tumor promotion by a CYP2B inducer. For the kidney, the present data provides further evidence that while DCB-induced alpha2U-globulin nephropathy is associated with a sustained stimulation of cell replication in male rat renal proximal tubule cells, this effect is not observed in the male mouse."

Significant changes in the clinical chemistry parameters were observed in both males and females of the 500 ppm group. Relative and absolute organ weight changes were also observed in males and females of the 500 ppm group at termination. These changes included increased absolute and relative liver weights in males, increased absolute and relative adrenal weights, and decreased relative and absolute spleen weights, and decreased heart weight in both males and females. In the 150 ppm group, the treatment resulted in some organ weight changes including increased absolute and relative liver weights in males and decreased absolute and relative spleen weights in both males and females and decreased heart weights in both males and females. Decreased spleen weight was also observed in both males and females in the 50 ppm group. No histopathological changes in these organs were reported. It should be noted that the reliability of such findings is limited because of the extremely limited number of animals used in such a study which precludes statistical analysis. The NOAEL/LOAEL in this study can be set at 150/500 ppm based on decreased mean body weight and food consumption in both males and females, changes in hematological and clinical chemistry parameters and changes in absolute and relative organ weights in both males and females."

Given its broad applications and high volatility, considerable concern exists regarding the adverse health effects of pDCB in the home and the workplace. In this study, changes in lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and trace element levels in the liver and kidney of pDCB-treated mice were investigated to determine their roles in toxicity. Mice were orally gavaged once daily for seven consecutive days with pDCB (0 (corn oil control), 450, and 900 mg/kg). The level of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, markedly increased in the high-dose pDCB group in both the liver and kidney compared with the control group. Changes in hepatic levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the pDCB groups were indistinguishable from the control group, while renal levels of reduced GSH in the high-dose pDCB group were significantly lowered in comparison to the control and the low-dose groups. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the liver of mice treated with pDCB showed a downward trend, whereas there was no consistent trend associated with changes in SOD activity in the kidney. Additionally, renal iron levels in the high-dose pDCB group were significantly decreased compared with the low-dose group and the controls, whereas hepatic iron content in the low-dose pDCB group was significantly lower compared with the controls. Selenium and zinc levels in the kidney were both significantly decreased in the high-dose pDCB group vs. the control and low-dose groups. There were no treatment-induced changes in copper levels in either the kidney or liver. However, a significant increase was found in the liver zinc/copper ratio in the high-dose pDCB group vs. the controls. In addition, blood zinc levels showed a downward trend with increased pDCB dosage. These results suggest that pDCB toxicity is mediated by oxidative damage and tissue-specific alterations in trace element levels both in the liver and the kidney of mice."

Three animals (2 males and 1 female) in the highest dose and one male control animal died during the study. Due to unexpected severe toxicity at the highest dose, the initial dose of 150 mg/kg/day was adjusted to 100 mg/kg/day for males during the 3rd week, and a further decrease to 75 mg/kg/day was made for both sexes at the beginning of the 6th week of the study. Both males and females at the highest dose level were untreated during the fourth and fifth weeks to allow recovery. Lower dose level animals were administered the test material continuously at the original dose levels. All treatment-related clinical signs were primarily limited to severely affected animals at the highest dose level. These clinical signs included hypoactivity, dehydration, decreased defecation, blood-like fecal color, emesis, emaciation, and/or pale (oral) mucosa. Group mean body weight did not show a significant difference from the control in either sex. However, cumulative body weight gain at the highest dose showed a significant deficit during the first month of the study. Following reduction of the dose and adjustment of food availability, surviving dogs in this high dose group resumed a more comparable weight gain pattern for the remained period of the study. A mild anemia (decreased RBC counts and HCT levels) in both sexes at the early stage (month 6) was observed in the high dose animals. At the end of the study, the mild anemia was resolved which correlated with microscopic findings of rib and sternal marrow erythroid hyperplasia in females and splenic excessive hematopoiesis and megakaryocyte proliferation in both sexes indicating a compensatory response to the earlier anemia. Elevated alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, and GGT levels and a decreased albumin level observed in both sexes at the mid- and high-dose levels, indicated hepatic effects of the test material. These findings were supported by increases in absolute and relative liver weights (both sexes) and microscopic findings in the liver including hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocellular pigment deposition, bile duct/ductile hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, bile stasis and hepatic portal inflammation. Kidney collecting duct epithelial vacuolation was present in a high-dose male and at all dose levels in females.

CD-1 mice were orally treated for 3 and 14 days with 3 known genotoxic hepatocarcinogens: C.I. Direct Black 38, Dimethylnitrosamine and 4,4'-Methylenedianiline; 3 nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens: 1,4-Dichlorobenzene, Phenobarbital sodium and Piperonyl butoxide; 4 nonhepatocarcinogens: Cefuroxime sodium, Nifedipine, Prazosin hydrochloride and Propranolol hydrochloride; and 3 compounds that show ambiguous results in genotoxicity testing: Cyproterone acetate, Thioacetamide and Wy-14643. By liver mRNA expression analysis using individual animal data, we identified 64 specific biomarker candidates for genotoxic carcinogens and 69 for nongenotoxic carcinogens for male mice at day 15. The majority of genotoxic carcinogen biomarker candidates possess functions in DNA damage response (eg, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, DNA repair). Most of the identified nongenotoxic carcinogen biomarker candidates are involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The derived biomarker lists were characterized with respect to their dependency on study duration and gender and were successfully used to characterize carcinogens with ambiguous genotoxicity test results, such as Wy-14643. The identified biomarker candidates improve the mechanistic understanding of drug-induced effects on the mouse liver that result in hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas in 2-year mouse carcinogenicity studies."

We quantified 35 genes selected from our previous DNA microarray studies using 12 different chemicals: 8 genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (2-acetylaminofluorene, 2,4-diaminotoluene, diisopropanolnitrosamine, 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, N-nitrosomorpholine, quinoline and urethane) and 4 non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (1,4-dichlorobenzene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and furan). A considerable number of genes exhibited significant changes in their gene expression ratios (experimental group/control group) analyzed statistically by the Dunnett's test and Welch's t-test. Finally, we distinguished between the genotoxic and non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens by statistical analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression profiles for 7 genes (Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Lpr1, Mbd1, Phlda3 and Tubb2c) at 4hr and for 12 genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Gdf15, Lrp1, Mbd1, Phlda3, Plk2 and Tubb2c) at 48 hr. Seven major biological processes were extracted from the gene ontology analysis: apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA damage, DNA repair, oncogenes and tumor suppression. The major, biologically relevant gene pathway suggested was the DNA damage response pathway, resulting from signal transduction by a p53-class mediator leading to the induction of apoptosis. Eight genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Gdf15, Phlda3 and Plk2) that are directly associated with Trp53 contributed to the PCA.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity is a form of liver injury caused by exposure to stressors. Genomic-based approaches have been used to detect changes in transcription in response to hepatotoxicants. However, there are no straightforward ways of using co-expressed genes anchored to a phenotype or constrained by the experimental design for discerning mechanisms of a biological response.  RESULTS: Through the analysis of a gene expression dataset containing 318 liver samples from rats exposed to hepatotoxicants and leveraging alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a serum enzyme indicative of liver injury as the phenotypic marker, we identified biological processes and molecular pathways that may be associated with mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Our analysis used an approach called Coherent Co-expression Biclustering (cc-Biclustering) for clustering a subset of genes through a coherent (consistency) measure within each group of samples representing a subset of experimental conditions. Supervised biclustering identified 87 genes co-expressed and correlated with ALT in all the samples exposed to the chemicals. None of the over-represented pathways related to liver injury. However, biclusters with subsets of samples exposed to one of the 7 hepatotoxicants, but not to a non-toxic isomer, contained co-expressed genes that represented pathways related to a stress response. Unsupervised biclustering of the data resulted in 1) four to five times more genes within the bicluster containing all the samples exposed to the chemicals, 2) biclusters with co-expression of genes that discerned 1,4 dichlorobenzene (a non-toxic isomer at low and mid doses) from the other chemicals, pathways and biological processes that underlie liver injury and 3) a bicluster with genes up-regulated in an early response to toxic exposure.  CONCLUSION: We obtained clusters of co-expressed genes that over-represented biological processes and molecular pathways related to hepatotoxicity in the rat. The mechanisms involved in the response of the liver to the exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene suggest non-genotoxicity whereas the exposure to the hepatotoxicants could be DNA damaging leading to overall genomic instability and activation of cell cycle check point signaling. In addition, key pathways and biological processes representative of an inflammatory response, energy production and apoptosis were impacted by the hepatotoxicant exposures that manifested liver injury in the rat."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) cause kidney tumors in male rats, but not in female rats or mice of either sex. Male rat-specific tumors also occur in rats dosed with a range of compounds including 1,4- dichlorobenzene (DCB) and d-limonene (DL). These compounds bind to a male rat-specific hepatic protein, alpha-2-urinary globulin (a2u), and form degradation-resistant complexes in the kidney. The resulting accumulation of a2u causes cell death and sustained regenerative cell proliferation, which in turn leads to the formation of renal tumors. To investigate whether the SCCP, Chlorowax 500C (C500C), causes tumors via the accumulation of a2u male rats were orally dosed with either C500C (625 mg/kg of body weight), DCB (300 mg/kg of body weight), or DL (150 mg/kg of body weight) for 28 consecutive days. An increase in renal a2u and cell proliferation was observed in DCB- and DL-treated rats but not in C500C-treated rats. C500C caused peroxisome proliferation and a down-regulation of a2u synthesis in male rat liver. This down-regulation occurred at the transcriptional level. Since less a2u was produced in C500C-treated rats, there was less available for accumulation in the kidney hence a typical a2u nephropathy did not appear. However, the administration of a radiolabelled SCCP, [(14)C]polychlorotridecane (PCTD), to male rats demonstrated its binding to renal a2u. Thus, it is possible that SCCPs bind to a2u and cause a slow accumulation of the protein in the kidney followed by delayed onset of a2u nephropathy. As a consequence of these findings in the current experiments, while evidence exists implicating a2u-globulin in the molecular mechanism of action of the C500C, the classic profile of a a2u-globulin nephropathy seen with other chemicals such as DCB and DL was not reproduced during this experimental protocol."

Using qPCR, 30 key genes were extracted from mouse livers at 4 hr and 28 days following dose-dependent gene expression alteration induced by DEN and ENU: the most significant changes in gene expression were observed at 4 hr. Next, we selected key point times at 4 and 48 h from changes in time-dependent gene expression during the acute phase following administration of chrysene by qPCR. We successfully showed discrimination of eight genotoxic hepatocarcinogens [2-acetylaminofluorene, 2,4-diaminotoluene, diisopropanolnitrosamine, 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene, 4-(methylnitsosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, N-nitrosomorpholine, quinoline and urethane] from four non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens [1,4-dichlorobenzene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, DEHP and furan] using qPCR and principal component analysis. Additionally, we successfully identified two rat genotoxic hepatocarcinogens [DEN and 2,6-dinitrotoluene] from a nongenotoxic-hepatocarcinogen [DEHP] and a non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogen [phenacetin] at 4 and 48 hr. The subsequent gene pathway analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis extracted the DNA damage response, resulting from the signal transduction of a p53-class mediator leading to the induction of apoptosis. The present review of these studies suggests that application of principal component analysis on the gene expression profile in rodent liver during the acute phase is useful to predict genotoxic hepatocarcinogens in comparison to non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens and/or non-carcinogenic hepatotoxins."

There is substantial evidence that para-dichlorobenzene induces these tumors through an alpha2u-globulin-associated response. Although para-dichlorobenzene does not bind to DNA in the male rat kidney, there is weak evidence that it binds to DNA in several tissues in treated mice. Both ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene have been reported to bind to proteins and DNA in the same mouse tissues. No attempt was made to isolate any DNA adducts. The data available on the genotoxicity of para-dichlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene also do not allow any distinction to be made between these two compounds, which differ significantly in their tumorigenicity: ortho-dichlorobenzene does not cause tumors, whereas para-dichlorobenzene causes liver tumors in mice and kidney tumors in male rats. Overall, the data on genotoxicity do not support a mechanism for renal-cell tumor induction in rats involving direct interaction of para-dichlorobenzene with DNA. Therefore, the overall data, including those on genotoxicity, indicate that para-dichlorobenzene causes renal tumors in male rats through an alpha2u-globulin associated response."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ The mechanism underlying the nephrotoxicity of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in the male F344 rat has been elucidated. It turns out that the 1,4-dichlorobenzene reversibly binds itself to a low molecular weight protein, alpha-2u-globulin, that is synthesised in the liver of the Sprague-Dawley (SD) and F344 male rats. The 1,4-dichlorobenzene-alpha2u-globulin complex can resist the catabolic action of the lysozymes, which then causes a renal lysosomal protein overload and the formation of tubular protein droplets (where the low molecular weight proteins are normally reabsorbed). This lysosomal overload leads to cell death, and then stimulates a secondary cellular proliferation. This alpha- 2u-globulin is specific to male rats. An increase in kidney type alpha-2u-globulin was detected in urine of male adult SD rats treated with 1,4-dichlorobenzene by gavage and in F344 male rats after single oral administration, with a positive correlation betweem the male rat nephropathy and 1,4-dichlorobenzene accumulation. The NBR male rats, species not synthesising alpha2u-globulin, did not develop renal lesions or hyalin droplets after oral administration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (500 mg/kg/day for 4 days). Moreover, a different elimination kinetic was found in male rat kidney from other tissues and could be related to the presence of the protein alpha2u-globulin. Compared to the control, an accelerated development of chronic nephrosis appears in treated F344 male rats during the recovery period after cessation of 1,4-dichlorobenzene treatment (9 months inhalation exposure to 75, 300, 600 ppm), in spite of the lack of any persisting alpha2u-globulin mediated nephropathy."

Such situations lead to high body burden of these pollutants in pregnant women. Consequently, fetuses and neonates will be exposed much more to DCB and p,p'-DDE via the mother. Therefore, the effects of the perinatal, combined exposure to DCB and p,p'-DDE on the female reproductive system have been investigated in mature rat female offspring of dams ingesting 25 p.p.m. DCB (approximately 2 mg/kg) and 125 p.p.m. p,p'-DDE (approximately 10 mg/kg) during the gestational and lactational period. Sexual maturation was fully developed in the rat female offspring perinatally exposed to DCB and/or p,p'-DDE through maternal exposure. The combined effect of DCB and p,p'-DDE was observed, and the ovarian weight was seen to decrease to approximately 80% of the control rat in matured female offspring following perinatal exposure to DCB and p,p'-DDE. This alteration might lead to reproductive dysfunction in matured female offspring. However, biological relevance of the alteration in the ovary remained uncertain in the present study. Further investigations concerning the reproductive function and mechanistic implication are required for elucidating the combined effects of perinatal exposure to DCB and p,p'-DDE on the later female reproductive system entirely."

In addition, DNA fragmentation, considered to be the result of apoptosis, was measured. Activity of ODC was measured by a radioisotope method, the proteolytic enzyme activity was measured following electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in which either casein or gelatine had been incorporated and apoptosis was measured by ELISA as 180-200 bp fragments of DNA labelled with BrdU released into the cytoplasm. TPA 0.1 ug/mL induced ODC within the first 1 hr, the enzyme activity reaching a maximum of about 2.0-fold the untreated level in 5-6 hours before returning towards control levels after 8-10 hours. Treatment with 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 10 ug/mL, for 5 hours had no effect on ODC activity, while simultaneous treatment with TPA and 1,4- dichlorobenzene for 5 hours, or TPA for 5 hours followed by 1,4-dichlorobenzene for 2 hours had little effect (slightly inhibitory) on that observed with TPA alone. In contrast, treatment with 1,4-dichlorobenzene for 1 hour followed by TPA for 5 hours increased the ODC activity by about 2.6-fold. Similar treatment protocols led to a TPA-induced reduction in proteolytic enzyme activity to about 92% after 5 hours of treatment, a slight increase by 1,4-dichlorobenzene alone (105%) or after simultaneous exposure to TPA and 1,4-dichlorobenzene for 5 hours (109%) and a slightly greater increase after sequential treatment was with 1,4-dichlorobenzene for 1 hour followed by TPA for 5 hours (121%).

Initial experiments investigating gene-specific methylation using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing, revealed partial methylation of p16 in the liver of rats treated with HCB and TCDD. However, no treatment related effects on the methylation status of Cx32, e-cadherin, VHL, c-myc, Igfbp2, and p15 were observed. We therefore applied genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation combined with microarrays to identify alterations in gene-specific methylation.

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Many drugs and environmental chemicals which are not directly mutagenic have the capacity to increase the incidence of tumors in the liver and other tissues. For this reason, such compounds are known as nongenotoxic carcinogens. The mechanisms underlying their effects remain unclear; however, their capacity to induce oxidative stress is considered to be a critical step in the carcinogenic process, although the evidence that this is actually the case remains equivocal and sparse. We have exploited a novel heme oxygenase-1 reporter mouse to evaluate the capacity of nongenotoxic carcinogens with different mechanisms of action to induce oxidative stress in the liver in vivo. When these compounds were administered at doses reported to cause liver tumors, marked differences in activation of the reporter were observed. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene and nafenopin were strong inducers of oxidative stress, whereas phenobarbital, piperonyl butoxide, cyproterone acetate, and WY14,643 were, at best, only very weak inducers. In the case of phenobarbital and thioacetamide, the number of LacZ-positive hepatocytes increased with time, and for the latter also with dose. The data obtained demonstrate that although some nongenotoxic carcinogens can induce oxidative stress, it is not a dominant feature of the response to these compounds. Therefore in contrast to the current models, these data suggest that oxidative stress is not a key determinant in the mechanism of nongenotoxic carcinogenesis but may contribute to the effects in a compound-specific manner."

After 7 days of exposure, plant uptake of DCB, TCB, \u03b3HCH was significant with bioconcentration factors reaching 14, 19 and 15, respectively. Afterwards, uptake and translocation were seen to be more complex, with a loss of the simple relationship between uptake and LogKow. Linear correlations between the bioconcentration/translocation factors and the physico-chemical properties of OCs were shown, demonstrating that translocation from roots to shoots increases with solubility and volatility of the OCs. This suggests that OC-translocation inside plants might result from the combination of two processes, xylem sap flow and vapor fluxes. 14C-phytovolatilization was measured and was correlated with the volatility of the compounds; the more volatile OCs being most the likely to be phytovolatilized from foliar surfaces (p = 0.0008).
