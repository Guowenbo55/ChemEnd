Rats exposed to the chemical at 50 mg showed extensive deposition of the metal oxide in respiratory epithelium and in the lumen of alveoli. Major bronchioles contained very little chemical deposition. Eosinophilic infiltration was also seen. Rats exposed to the chemical at 25 mg showed less pronounced changes in the lungs. Deposits were found almost exclusively in the respiratory epithelium. Lymphatic nodes of rats exposed to 50 mg contained significant deposits; relatively less was found in 25 mg dosed animals. Lymph node weight increased 100 to 300 percent. Lungs, lymphatic nodes, and spleen showed the presence of many dehydrogenases and phosphatases even though their content varied.

Rats were intratracheally instilled with 5-100 mg/kg of dust and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase and total protein and ex vivo alveolar macrophage fibronectin release assessed on day 7, 14, and 28 after exposure. Lung dust burdens were determined on days 1, 7, and 28 after instillation. Both dusts elicited dose related increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase and total protein, a response which was more pronounced and progressive with silica. All doses of silica elicited persistent increase in alveolar macrophage fibronectin release. Titanium dioxide stimulated persistent increases in alveolar macrophage fibronectin release at greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg, with transient or no effect at less than or equal to 10 mg/kg. Increased silica retention was observed for all doses and titanium dioxide retention was increased only at doses at greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. In vitro exposure of naive alveolar macrophage to silica or titanium dioxide did not stimulate alveolar macrophage fibronectin release. Histopathology demonstrated fibrosis at all silica doses; only titanium dioxide doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg resulted in fibrosis. These results reveal an association between increased dust retention, lung injury activation of alveolar macrophage fibronectin release, and the development of fibrosis. The magnitude and temporal pattern of responses clearly differentiated silica from titanium dioxide. The correlation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid markers of lung injury and increased alveolar macrophage fibronectin release with the development of fibrosis supports the use of these parameters as predictive biomarkers of dust induced interstitial lung disease."

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on lungs obtained after 7, 14, 28, and 63 days. Lavage fluid total and differential cellularity, lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, and protein concentration were determined. Alveolar macrophages were isolated from the BAL fluid. Spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and fibronectin by the macrophages was measured. Lungs taken from some rats on days 28 and 63 were examined for histopathological changes. Lungs from silica and titanium-dioxide exposed rats contained 1.9 and 1.8 milligrams silica and titanium-dioxide, respectively, 1 day post exposure. About 72% of the silica burden and 39% of the titanium-dioxide burden was present 28 days post exposure. Silica significantly increased BAL fluid LDH activity on day 63 post exposure, total protein concentration on days 28 and 63, alveolar macrophage counts on day seven, neutrophil counts on days 14 and 28, and lymphocyte counts on day 63. BAL fluid NAG activity was not affected by silica. Titanium-dioxide did not significantly affect any of the BAL fluid parameters. Silica, but not titanium-dioxide, significantly increased LPS stimulated IL-1 and fibronectin release by alveolar macrophages. Silica caused a minimal interstitial infiltration in the alveolar duct and perivascular regions. Except for the presence of fine brown particles in the alveolar macrophages and peribronchiolar lymphoid areas, titanium-dioxide induced no changes in lung tissue. The authors conclude that the differential responses to silica and titanium-dioxide support the use of BAL fluid analysis to assess the relative potential of a material to cause lung injury."

Subsequent to the exposure to titanium dioxide, the animals were also infected by aerosol with Legionella pneumophila. The titanium dioxide dust used was of the rutile crystal lattice type. The exposure chamber was supplied with a concentration of 23 + or - 7.3 mg/cu m for 20 hours a day, for 14 consecutive days. The findings indicated that the lattice form rutile was inert, nonfibrogenic and did not induce pathological changes in the lungs. However, the dust particles did persist and even 6 weeks after the cessation of exposure, large numbers of dust laden pulmonary macrophages remained in alveoli, airways and pulmonary lymphoid tissue. Alveolar wall thickening occurred only on a small scale, due to the accumulation of macrophages in the interstitium and not to deposition of connective tissue fibers. Extracellular titanium dioxide particles were still found at 6 weeks, probably representing dust released from lysed macrophages. /It was concluded/ that the macrophage blockade did not change the susceptibility of the animals to Legionnaires' Disease nor did it increase mortality. In the early stages the macrophage blockade limited multiplication of L pneumophila in the lungs. Later blood monocytes were recruited into the lungs where they phagocytosed L pneumophila, resulting in lung counts which were comparable to those of the control animals who had not been exposed to titanium dioxide."

We investigated such correlations using a model involving TiO2 particles of two particle sizes (20 nm diameter, ultrafine; 250 nm diameter, fine) of the same crystalline structure (anatase). A 12-week inhalation experiment in rats resulted in a similar mass deposition of the two particle types in the lower respiratory tract. The ultrafine particles elicited a persistently high inflammatory reaction in the lungs of the animals compared to the larger-sized particles. In the postexposure period (up to 1 year) retention in the alveolar space per se was not different between fine and ultrafine TiO2. However, the following differences between the particle types were noted: a significantly different total pulmonary retention, both quantitatively (significantly prolonged retention of the ultrafine TiO2) and qualitatively (increased translocation to the pulmonary interstitium and persistence there of the ultrafine TiO2); greater epithelial effects (Type II cell proliferation; occlusion of pores of Kohn) and the beginning of interstitial fibrotic foci with ultrafine TiO2; significant sustained impairment of alveolar macrophage function after ultrafine TiO2 exposure as measured by the clearance of test particles. A correlation between particle surface area and effects was observed. A comparison of the adverse reactions with dosimetric parameters of TiO2 in different lung compartments in the postexposure period showed a correlation of the persistence of effects in both the alveolar and interstitial space with the persistence of particles in the respective compartment."

Male rats were exposed to air, TiO2 or CI particles 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks at concentrations of 5, 50, and 250 mg/cu m and evaluated at selected intervals through 6 months postexposure. Indices of pulmonary inflammation as well as alveolar macrophage clearance functions (i.e., morphology, in vivo and in vitro phagocytosis, and chemotaxis), cell proliferation, and histopathology endpoints were measured at several postexposure time periods through 6 months. In addition, amounts of TiO2 or CI in lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were measured to allow an evaluation of particle clearance and translocation patterns. Four-week exposures to TiO2 or CI particles at concentrations of 250 mg/cu m resulted in lung burdens of 12 mg titanium and 17 mg iron, respectively, with particle retention half-times ranging from 68 days for 5 mg/cu m TiO2 to approximately 330 days for 250 mg/cu m. The impact of this TiO2 dust load and similar lung burdens of CI particles produced a sustained pulmonary inflammatory response measured through a period of 3-6 months postexposure concomitant with increases in BrdU cell labeling of terminal airway and pulmonary parenchymal cells. The impairment of particle clearance mechanisms was accounted for by deficits in in vitro phagocytic and chemotactic potential of alveolar macrophages recovered from the lungs of high-dose, TiO2- or CI-exposed rats. Free granular pigment (TiO2 or CI) was present on the hypertrophic mucosal surfaces of bronchioles and bronchi, and particle-laden macrophages, found individually, were numerous throughout alveoli and within lymphoid tissues immediately after exposure. Aggregates of particle-laden macrophages were present within alveoli and alveolar ducts from 1 week postexposure through the entire 6-month recovery period. Macrophage accumulations increased in size and number from 1 week through 1 month postexposure and then appeared to remain constant through the remaining 5-month postexposure period. Minimal cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia were evident at alveolar duct bifurcations adjacent to macrophage aggregates, and this effect was most prominent at 3 to 6 months postexposure. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that exposure to high dust concentrations of two different innocuous particle types produced sustained pulmonary inflammation, enhanced proliferation of pulmonary cells, impairment of particle clearance, deficits in macrophage function, and the appearance of macrophage aggregates at sites of particle deposition. In addition, the mass deposition rate determination appears to be a less sensitive indicator of \"overload\" when compared to biomarkers of pulmonary toxicity, such as macrophage function and cellular inflammation and proliferation indices."

A fourth group exposed to air served as a negative control. Rats were sacrificed after 3 and 6 months exposure, after 1 year or at the end of 2 years of exposure. At the 50 mg/cu m exposure level, lung weights increased significantly from 6 months throughout 2 years exposure. Lungs of rats at 250 mg/cu m showed a marked increase in weight from 3 months exposure and attained more than twice their normal weight after 1 and 2 years exposure. White foci appeared in the visceral surface of the lung at 10 mg/cu m exposure. In the lungs of rats exposed to 10 mg/cu m for 3 months, microscopy revealed small numbers of dust laden macrophages (dust cells) retained in the alveoli adjacent to the alveolar ducts. In rats exposed to 50 mg/cu m for 12 months, the most striking finding was the appearance of numerous foamy macrophages containing few dust particles (foamy dust cells). All exposed rats showed dose and exposure time related dust deposition in the tracheobronchial and mediastinal lympyh nodes, but there was no tissue reaction to dust particles. After 2 years exposure, titanium dioxide retention in the lungs was 3% at 10 mg/cu m, 9.6% at 50 mg/cu m, and 28% at 250 mg/cu m. Alveolar proteinosis (lipoproteinosis) appears to be an important marker indicating an overload lung clearance following exposure to tiny particles smaller than 2 micrometers. As a result of chronic insults by titanium dioxide exposure, cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas were developed from metaplastic squamous epithelium in the alveoli showing bronchiolarization adjacent to the alveolar ducts. It was extremely difficult to differentiate lung tumors from squamous metaplasia. /It was concluded/ that this lung cancer is a unique experimentally induced tumor in rats that has not been seen as a spontaneous lung tumor in man or animals."

Although the uses of TiO2 have become so widespread, there is limited information concerning its toxicity on humans. However, the genotoxicity of TiO2 remains to be controversial. The possible genotoxic effects of TiO2 have been evaluated in human whole blood cultures (WBCs) related to oxidative status. The blood was processed to examine the following oxidative stress markers: glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, the frequencies of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronuclei (MN) were scored as genetic endpoints. Different concentrations of TiO2 (1, 2, 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 uM) were tested. From the results, it appeared that TiO2 was able to induce genotoxic effects, as observed by the increases found in SCE and MN frequencies in TiO2-treated cultures.

Nanoparticles of the iron oxides magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) and hematite (Fe(2)O(3)) also have many industrial applications but their toxicological properties are less documented than those of TiO(2). In the present study, the in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of commercially available nanosized and microsized anatase TiO(2), rutile TiO(2), Fe(3)O(4), and Fe(2)O(3) particles were compared in Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells. Samples were characterized for chemical composition, primary particle size, crystal phase, shape, and specific surface area. In acellular assays, TiO(2) and iron oxide particles were able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the same mass dose, all nanoparticles produced higher levels of ROS than their microsized counterparts. Measurement of particle size in the SHE culture medium showed that primary nanoparticles and microparticles are present in the form of micrometric agglomerates of highly poly-dispersed size. Uptake of primary particles and agglomerates by SHE exposed for 24 hr was observed for all samples. TiO(2) samples were found to be more cytotoxic than iron oxide samples. Concerning primary size effects, anatase TiO(2), rutile TiO(2), and Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles induced higher cytotoxicity than their microsized counterparts after 72 hr of exposure. Over this treatment time, anatase TiO(2) and Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles also produced more intracellular ROS compared to the microsized particles. However, similar levels of DNA damage were observed in the comet assay after 24 hr of exposure to anatase nanoparticles and microparticles. Rutile microparticles were found to induce more DNA damage than the nanosized particles. However, no significant increase in DNA damage was detected from nanosized and microsized iron oxides. None of the samples tested showed significant induction of micronuclei formation after 24 hr of exposure.

PM(10) can induce expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, but there is controversy about the types and/or sizes of particles involved and, in particular, whether ultrafine particles are the major toxic agents. To examine whether particle size affects mediator generation, we exposed rat tracheal explants, an inflammatory cell-free model of the airway wall, to various concentrations up to 500 ug/sq cm of fine (0.12 micrometer) or ultrafine (0.021 micrometer) titanium dioxide (anatase), maintained the explants in an organ culture in air for 1-7 days, and used RT-PCR to examine the expression of fibrogenic mediators and procollagen. No increase in gene expression was seen at 1 or 3 days, but at 5 days, ultrafine dust induced a small increase in procollagen. At 7 days, fine titanium dioxide produced significantly greater increases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B, transforming growth factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta compared with those by ultrafine dust; both dusts produced similar increases for PDGF-A; and ultrafine dust produced increases in procollagen expression, whereas fine dust had no effect. Expression levels were dose related. Both dusts produced a similar decrease in expression of PDGF receptor-alpha and a similar increase in PDGF receptor-beta. These observations suggest that ultrafine particles are intrinsically able to induce procollagen expression even in the absence of inflammatory cells; that chronic exposure to PM(10) may result in chronic airflow obstruction, in part because of ultrafine particle-mediated increases in airway wall fibrosis; and that chemically identical dusts of differing size can produce quite different patterns of gene expression in the airway wall.
