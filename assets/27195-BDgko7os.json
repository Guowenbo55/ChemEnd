    "Description": "Benodanil is a member of the class of benzamides, obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-iodobenzoic acid with the amino group of aniline. An obsolete fungicide once used mainly to control rust diseases. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzamides, an anilide, an organoiodine compound and a benzanilide fungicide.",

Over the initial 3-week growth period, the dry mass per seedling exhibited a positive correlation with the benodanil application rate and a negative correlation with stem damage. The concentrations of the fungicide found in the roots, stems, and leaves at transplantation and after 21 days were positively correlated with the application rates, but decreased by 94% in stems and roots within 21 days. Moreover, stem damage at 21 days post-planting showed a negative correlation with the logarithm of the benodanil concentration both at planting and 21 days later.",
