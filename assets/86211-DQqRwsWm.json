    "Description": "Ipconazole is a member of the class of cyclopentanols carrying 1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl, 4-chlorobenzyl and isopropyl substituents at positions 1, 2 and 5 respectively. Used to control a range of seed diseases in rice, vegetables and other, mainly non-food, crops. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of cyclopentanols, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of triazoles, a tertiary alcohol, a conazole fungicide and a triazole fungicide.",

Seeds were treated with two types of 14C-labeled ipconazole, [T-14C]-ipconazole labeled at the triazole ring and [B-14C]-ipconazole labeled at the benzylmethylene position. After 22 days, 40-41% of the applied radioactivity was recovered from soil, 27% from roots and seeds, and only 0.36-0.42% from rice shoots. The main metabolites in rice seedlings were oxidative products at the carbons of the isopropyl group and the benzylmethylene, with trace amounts of conjugated metabolites. Residues in hulled rice from plants treated with [T-14C]-ipconazole and [B-14C]-ipconazole were 2.5 \u00b5g eq./kg and 0.2 csg eq./kg, respectively. Ipconazole and its metabolites detected in seedlings were not found in hulled rice, with most of the radioactivity from [T-14C]-ipconazole detected in the unextractable residue and water-soluble fraction from hulled rice.",
