Pentachloroaniline degrades through preferential ortho chlorine removal displaying a rate constant of 0.017 day-1 with a half-life of 40 days(2)."

In Belgium, soil from a lettuce field contained 0.85 ppm of pentachloroaniline while soil from a chicory field contained 2.5 ppm. In Denmark, a field soil sample contained 1.8 ppm while soil from a greenhouse field in the Netherlands contained trace amounts of pentachloroaniline(3)."
