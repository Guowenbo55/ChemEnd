            "Value": "AEROBIC: 1,3-Dichloropropene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 3% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as not readily biodegradable(1); additional degradation was observed yielding 3-chloro-2-propen-1-ol(1), possibly from hydrolysis and degradation of the hydrolysis products(SRC). A BOD dilution water study using settled domestic wastewater as the microbia1 inoculum found that 5-10 mg/L concentrations of 1,3-dichloropropene were degraded by 54-85% after 7 days of incubation with the faster rates achieved following weekly adaptations(1); however, the rate of biodegradation for 1,3-dichloropropene in natural waters cannot be inferred from this screening study data(3). Common soil bacteria were able to utilize 1,3-dichloropropene as a sole carbon source in pure culture studies(4). Twelve weeks after labeled cis- or trans-1,3-dichloropropene was added to soil and stored in sealed containers, 19% of the cis and 18% of the trans isomers remained in sandy loam and 10% of cis and 22% of trans isomer remained in medium loam(5). After 20 weeks, 5% and 4% of the cis and trans isomer, respectively, remained in sandy loam and 3% and 14%, respectively remained in the medium loam(5); the half-life of the applied dichloropropenes were 3-4 weeks; it was possible that some of the parent compound was lost by volatilization(5). 14C-1,3-Dichloropropene, added at 100 ug/g soil and incubated aerobically in the dark at 25 \u00b0C, displayed half-lives of 1.8, 12.3, and 61 days using Wahiawa silt clay, Catlin silt loam, and Fuquay loamy sand, respectively(6); degradation products were 3-chloroallyl alcohol, 3-chloroacrylic acid, numerous minor carboxylic acid metabolites, and carbon dioxide(6). Degradation of 1,3-dichloropropene was greatly enhanced in amended soils compared to the unamended soil, and the degree of acceleration varied with the type as well as the rate of amendment(7); compost manure was more effective in stimulating 1,3-dichloropropene degradation than a less decomposed biosolid-manure mix; the acceleration in compost manure-amended soils was a combined result of enhanced chemical and microbial degradation, since sterilization only partially reduced the enhanced degradation(7). Complete mineralization of 1,3-dichloropropene, based on chloride release, can be a matter of years(8). A 5 ug/mL test compound added to a sediment sample from a drainage ditch at an agricultural field station in Marcham, England was readily converted to 3-chloropropionic acid(9). 1,3-Dichloropropene is degraded more rapidly in soil that has a history of treatment with this pesticide than in previously untreated soil(3). While the degradation rates of the cis- and trans- isomers are similar in untreated soil, degradation in previously treated soil has been shown to be more rapid for trans-1,3-dichloropropene than for cis-1,3-dichloropropene(3)."

            "Value": "1,3-Dichloropropene (1,3-D) is a soil fumigant used primarily for preplanting control of parasitic nematodes. In a previous chronic dietary exposure study, 1,3-D induced an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in male rats at a dose of 25?mg/kg/day. Although the mechanism for tumor induction in the rat liver by 1,3-D has not been specifically elucidated, available data suggested that the observed liver tumorigenesis was through a nongenotoxic mode of action at the tumor promotion stage. Fischer 344 rats containing preneoplastic lesions were treated (via gavage) with 25 mg/kg/day 1,3-D or 80 mg/kg/day phenobarbital (PB) for 30 days and 60 days, or for 30 days followed by a 30-day recovery period (no compound exposure). Following treatment, placental form glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) positive and GSTP-negative liver focal lesions were quantitated as to size and number. 1,3-D treatment had no effect on GSTP-positive foci number or relative size but significantly increased the number, labeling index, and relative size of GSTP-negative focal lesions (identified by H and E staining) after 30 and 60 days of treatment. Following the 30-day recovery period, the number, labeling index, and relative size of the GSTP-negative lesions in 1,3-D-treated animals returned to control levels. As expected, PB treatment produced an increase in number and relative size of the GSTP-positive lesions. The results of this study are consistent with 1,3-D inducing liver carcinogenesis through a nongenotoxic mode of action by functioning as a tumor promoter specifically through induction of a non-GSTP staining focal hepatocyte population."

An increase in concentration of rat-liver homogenate fraction (S9) in the metabolizing system (S9 mix) enhances mutagenicity for 1,3-dichloropropene and 2,3-dichloro-1-propene. According to the effects of the enzyme inhibitors SKF525, 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-oxide and cyanamide, the allylic chloropropenes fall into 3 groups distinguished by their mode of metabolic activation by S9 mix. 1,3-Dichloropropene is hydrolyzed to the corresponding allylic alcohol which can be oxidized to the respective acroleins (hydrolytic oxidative pathway). Structural parameters like chloro substitution of the central C atom of the substituted induced polarization of the C as cis/trans isomerism might be responsible for different substrate properties for the enzymes involved in allylic chloropropene metabolism, thus determining different degrees of activation by either one or both pathways."

The computational results suggest that the primary mechanism of action involves the SN1 formation of allylic cations which then react with nucleophilic centers of nucleic acid bases. The usefulness of computed properties in estimating the degree of alkylating activity and mutagenicity was evaluated. In general, stability of the allylic carbocation intermediate and the degree of charge delocalization in the allyl system correlate well with observed mutagenic potentials."

Piperonyl butoxide was used to inhibit cytochrome p-450 and buthionine sulfoximine to inhibit glutathione synthesis. 1,3-dichloropropene (300 mg/kg) administered with a stomach tube significantly increased plasma glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities as well as hepatic centrilobular swelling 15 hr after administration. No significant changes were observed at 100 mg/kg 1,3-dichloropropene. Piperonyl butoxide pretreatment significantly suppressed the elevation of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities caused by 300 mg/kg 1,3-dichloropropene. This pretreatment significantly increased 1,3-dichloropropene concn in the liver. The piperonyl butoxide pretreatment decreased cytochrome p450 content in liver microsomes but prevented further reduction of cytochrome p-450 after 1,3-dichloropropene treatment. With buthionine sulfoximine pretreatment plasma glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase activity significantly increased in animals receiving 100 mg/kg 1,3-dichloropropene, whereas liver glutathione content and glutathione-S-transferase activity decreased. This pretreatment also significantly increased 1,3-dichloropropene concn in the liver. Cysteine administered 2 hr after 1,3-dichloropropene treatment by which time 1,3-dichloropropene in the liver had disappeared did not decrease the cytochrome p-450 content induced by 1,3-dichloropropene, although it prevented the elevation of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities and increased hepatic glutathione concn. These results suggest 1,3-dichloropropene is biotransformed via cytochrome p450, the metabolites induced liver damage and glutathione plays an important role in the detoxification of 1,3-dichloropropene."

Glutathione content was determined in nasal tissue, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and testes. No 1,3-dichloropropene was detected in the blood of rats 2 hr after exposure to up to 955 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene. When one rat was exposed to 100 mg/kg 1,3-dichloropropene orally, both cis and trans isomers of 1,3-dichloropropene were detected in the blood 2 hr after exposure. Nasal tissue glutathione content was decreased to 27% of control at 5 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene, to 23% at 31 ppm, to 18% at 71 ppm, and to 12% at 223 ppm. In lung tissue, glutathione content remained relatively constant at 68 to 82% of control after exposure of 2-955 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene. Exposure to up to 955 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene had little or no effect on the glutathione levels of heart and testes. Significantly decreased glutathione levels in heart, lung, liver, and testes were observed after exposure to 1716 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene. A concn dependent decr of glutathione levels in the liver was observed for exposure between 772 and 1716 ppm 1,3-dichloropropene. No change in lung wet wt was observed for any exposure. Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, when measured 6 hr after 1,3-dichloropropene exposure, was decreased only for the highest 1,3-dichloropropene concn. The results showed that, at least at low levels, 1,3-dichloropropene was detoxified by conjugation to glutathione in nasal tissue."

Doses administered were 0, 25, or 50 mg/kg to rats and 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg to mice. Telone II was given in corn oil by gavage 3 times per week for 104 wk. Ancillary studies were conducted to determine time-related effects, in which dose groups containing 5 male and 5 females rats were killed after receiving Telone II for 9, 16, 21, 24, or 27 mo. The primary organs affected were the forestomach (rats and mice), urinary bladder (mice), lung (mice), and liver (rats). Compound-related non-neoplastic lesions included basal-cell or epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach (rats and mice), epithelial hyperplasia of the urinary bladder (mice), and hydronephrosis (mice). Neoplastic lesions associated with administration of Telone II included squamous-cell papillomas of the forestomach (male and female rats, female mice), squamous-cell carcinomas of the forestomach (Male rats, female mice), transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder (female mice), alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas (female mice), and neoplastic nodules of the liver (male rats). Although cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene are the principal components of Telone II, the presence of 1% epichlorohydrin, a direct-acting mutagen and carcinogen added as stabilizer, may have influenced the development of forestomach lesions. The results of the ancillary studies supported the findings of the carcinogenesis studies and demonstrated the time-dependent development of lesions in the forestomach (basal-cell hyperplasia and squamous-cell papilloma). Under the conditions of these gavage studies, Telone II was shown to be carcinogenic in male and female F344 rats and female B6C3F1 mice. Although the study in male B6C3F1 mice was considered inadequate because of the low survival resulting from suppurative inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) in the control group, there was some indication of Telone II-related increases of transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder, squamous-cell papillomas of the forestomach, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas of the lung."

Technical grade 1,3-DCP is genotoxic/mutagenic and carcinogenic. /A previous study/ reported that mutagenic activity is lost after purification of 1,3-DCP samples via silica gel column chromatography. We found that mutagenicity and SOS repair in Escherichia coli, strain PM 21, are strongly reduced after purification via silica gel and that mutagenicity and induction of SOS repair depend on oxidative impurities and secondary products. Both isomers (E and Z) of 1,3-DCP are oxidized to 1,3-dichloropropene epoxide (1,3-DCP-Ox). The epoxide is subjected to rapid internal rearrangement to 2,3-dichloropropanal (2,3-DCPA), which spontaneously eliminates HCl and forms the extremely mutagenic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic 2-chloroacrolein (alpha-chloroacrolein) alpha-ClA. Thus, the genotoxic/mutagenic effects of unpurified 1,3-DCP samples mainly depend on alpha-ClA. The underlying genotoxic and mutagenic mechanism is formation of promutagenic exocyclic 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts of alpha-ClA. Pure 1,3-DCP samples have only a very low S(N)1 reactivity as measured in trifluoroacetic acid solvolysis reactions, hydrolysis, and computed reactivities but possess a moderate S(N)2 reactivity as determined in alkylation tests with the nucleophiles 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) and N-methyl-mercaptoimidazole (MMI). Evidently, the low S(N)1 reactivity is not sufficient to form necessary amounts of O(6)-alkylguanine DNA adducts required for back-mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535. The S(N)2 reactivity may, however, lead to other DNA adducts, e.g., N7-guanine adducts, which can induce error prone repair in S. typhimurium strain TA100 and thus lead to back-mutation in this strain. Application of 1,3-DCP samples in agriculture must be considered as a mutagenic risk because the samples can be oxidized and form the extremely mutagenic alpha-ClA. As a consequence, it is questionable whether any stabilizers can prevent oxidation during application."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ DCP significantly increased the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) in bone marrow cells of female mice by fivefold. In contrast to these findings, DCP was inactive in a dominant lethal study. Groups of 11-week-old male CD rats (30 animals/group) were exposed by inhalation 6 hours/day, 7 days/week for 10 weeks to DCP vapors at concentrations of 0, 10, 60, or 150 ppm. At the conclusion of the exposures, each male was cohoused with naive adult virgin CD females for two consecutive mating trials (1 week/trial, 2 females/male). Females were necropsied 13 days after the conclusion of each weekly mating trial. There were no statistically significant increases in either pre- or postimplantation embryonic/fetal loss in females mated with DCP exposed males relative to the controls. Based on these results, the conclusion was that DCP was not mutagenic to the male germ cells of CD rats at exposure </=150 ppm."

None of the preparations retained mutagenic activity after chromatography, but each contained direct acting mutagenic polar impurities in the Ames test. The specific mutagenic activities of the unpurified samples appeared to be detected by the mutagenic activities of their polar impurities. A mixture of mutagenic polar impurities could be regenerated by refluxing a purified preparation for 6 hr. The fraction of polar impurities from one of the preparations was analyzed by GC/MS. Although its composition was too complex to characterize completely, two known mutagens, epichlorhydrin and 1,3-dichloro-2,2-propanol, were tentatively identified."

Compared to 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane is a less potent mutagen in the sex-linked recessive lethal assay system. For both compounds, there is no evidence of a clear-cut dose-rate effect. 1,2-Dichloroethane and dichloromethane were also investigated in the somatic mutation and recombination test, with results similar to those from the sex-linked recessive lethal assay. For 1,2-dichloroethane the genetic activity profile was further analyzed by carrying out a sex-chromosome loss assay and a complementation analysis of a series of induced recessive lethal mutations. A review of the use of inhalation in mutagenicity assays with Drosophila shows that this route of exposure is an effective one. Especially with chronic exposure times, rather low exposure concn can be detected. With compounds of intermediate volatility inhalation is not superior to other modes of administration; nor is it likely to be sensitive enough for in situ monitoring."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ The metabolism of cysteine S-conjugates of both cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene in the presence of rat kidney microsomes and purified flavin-containing monooxygenase from hog liver was investigated in vitro. Preliminary studies with isolated rat kidney cells demonstrated that cysteine S-conjugates were quite toxic to the cells in a process which was consistent with a role of the flavin-containing monooxygenase in the bioactivation of the nephrotoxins. Putative S-oxide metabolites of cysteine S-conjugates were chemically synthesized, and diastereomers were separated and identified by spectroscopic means. The metabolic products of cysteine S-conjugates were identified by comparing the chemical properties of the metabolites with authentic synthetic cysteine S-conjugate S-oxides. Surprisingly, S-conjugate S-oxygenase activity was not observed with rat kidney microsomes but was present when cysteine S-conjugates were incubated with the highly purified flavin containing monooxygenase from hog liver. The kinetic parameters indicated that considerable S-oxygenase stereoselectivity and structural selectivity was observed: cis cysteine S-conjugates were preferred substrates and N-acetylation of cysteine S-conjugates decreased substrate activity. S-Oxygenation was considerably diastereoselective and diastereoselectivity was much greater for cysteine S-conjugates with higher Vmax values. Cysteine S-conjugate S-oxides were not indefinitely stable, and under certain conditions, the S-oxides underwent a (2,3)-sigmatropic rearrangement to acrolein. Formation of acrolein or other electrophilic products from S-(chloropropenyl)cysteine conjugate S-oxides may contribute to the renal effects observed for S-(chloropropenyl)cysteine conjugates. Thus, cytotoxicity studies with isolated rat proximal tubular cells or LLC-PK1 cells treated with cysteine S-conjugates showed a time and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. Reduction of renal cytotoxicity of cysteine S-conjugates in the presence of methimazole, an alternate substrate competitive inhibitor of the flavin containing monooxygenase, suggested that this enzyme may contribute to the renal effects of 1,3-dichloropropene."

It was demonstrated that a dose related decrease in hepatic triglyceride secretion is a common effect produced by both series of chlorinated alkanes. Using isolated hepatocytes a positive correlation between chlorinated alkane potency and increasing solvent lipid solubility was observed. However, this order of potency did not correlate with in vivo findings in which the less lipid soluble solvents were found to be the most potent."

The average Koc for 3 soils with organic carbon of 3.19%, 10.4%, and 55.1% was 27 and 28 for cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene, respectively(2). The average maximum Koc values were 20 for sand, 25 for loamy sand, and 41 and 42 for two clay soils(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that 1,3-dichloropropene is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The adsorption onto soil from the vapor is greater for the trans- than the cis- isomer(3). The adsorption isotherm for the vapor/soil system is linear(3). When 1,3-dichloropropene is used in farm fields, it is sprayed directly on the ground or injected into the soil(5). Once in the soil, it can exist as a gas or dissolved in water. 1,3-Dichloropropene can adsorb more strongly to soil when it is in the vapor phase than when it is dissolved in water(5). Vapor-phase adsorption can be approximately 3-times greater at 2 \u00b0C than it is at 20 \u00b0C, and adsorption isotherms measured for humus sand, peaty sand, and peat indicate vapor-phase Koc values ranging from 450 to 750(5). According to a classification scheme(4), these vapor-phase Koc values suggest that 1,3-dichloropropene may have moderate to low mobility in soil."

            "Value": "Adsorption is higher in dry soils than in moist soil(2). However, water-saturated soils have air passageways blocked and fumigant movement is decreased(2). This is illustrated by a 20-day study in which the 1,3-dichloropropene diffused to >.46 m in a silty clay loam with 23% moisture (dry wt) and >1.20 m in the same soil when the moisture content was 7.7%(2). The concentration of 1,3-dichloropropene was monitored at ground level and at 42 inches above ground after fumigant was applied to a pineapple field at a depth of 18 inches(1). 1,3-Dichloropropene levels were relatively constant (20-50 ppb) at ground level for 6 days after fumigation; after 9 days the concentration steadily declined to <0.1 ppb after 27-30 days. A light rain at day 6 temporarily increased the release of the fumigant 100-fold(1). The reduced adsorption due to increased soil moisture, resulted in a transfer of fumigant from soil to water at or near the soil surface, after which evaporation occurred. At 42 inches above ground level, 1,3-dichloropropene was still detectable and was probably drifting in from other fields(1)."

The evaluation conducted by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament covers various aspects, including toxicology, residues, environmental fate, and behavior, among others. In the section of mammalian toxicology, concerns were raised regarding the representativeness of batches used in toxicological studies and the lack of reference values for non-dietary risk assessment. Additional data and assessments were identified as necessary for further evaluation of impurities and metabolites' toxicological relevance.In the residues section, data gaps were found, and the consumer assessment for residues of potentially relevant impurities was not possible due to insufficient data. Residue trials were also deemed insufficient to address residues of (EZ)-1,3-Dichloropropene for all representative crops.Regarding the fate and behavior in the environment, there were several data gaps and areas of concern. Groundwater exposure assessments indicated that the limit of 0.1 \u03bcg/L would be exceeded for certain scenarios relevant to tomato crops. The potential for groundwater contamination from some impurities was identified, and further assessment would be needed to address this concern.[Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene]"
