    "Description": "Carboxin is an anilide obtained by formal condensation of the amino group of aniline with the carboxy group of 2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-1,4-oxathiine-3-carboxylic acid. A fungicide for control of bunts and smuts that is normally used as a seed treatment. It has a role as an EC 1.3.5.1 [succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)] inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an anilide, an enamide, an oxacycle, an organosulfur heterocyclic compound, an anilide fungicide and a secondary carboxamide.",

The primary metabolite was identified as carboxin sulfoxide. Carboxin degraded with a half-life of 34 days in an aquatic metabolism study using silt loam soil that was incubated in the dark at 25 \u00b0C under aerobic conditions(1). Carboxin degraded slowly with a mean half-life of 129 days in two anaerobic soil metabolism studies using sandy loam soils maintained in the dark at 25 \u00b0C(1). Carboxin sulfoxide was identified as a major degradation product (>10% of the initially applied amount) and carboxin sulfone was identified as a minor metabolite. The half-life of carboxin was 239 days in an anaerobic aquatic metabolism study(1)."

The blue-green algae Anabaena, Nostoc, & Tolypothrix extensively degraded the fungicides, carboxin oxycarboxin. Chlorella vulgaris also degraded them. The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum failed to degrade carboxin beyond sulfoxide stage, but degraded oxycarboxin to a greater extent. The protozoan species, Colpoda, degraded carboxin extentively but not oxycarboxin."

In another study of aerobic soils (sandy loam, clay, laterite, alkaline, and coffee plantation soil) carboxin underwent degradation to its sulfoxide within 10 days in all soils(2)."

At low concentrations it inhibited mitochondrial succinate oxidation from the sensitive fungus Ustilago maydis. The inhibition was of the noncompetitive nature. It is believed that carboxin inhibits mitochondrial respiration at or close to the site of succinate oxidation and does not greatly affect the remaining portion of the electron transport system or the coupled phosphorylation reactions."

Comparison of this sequence with that of the iron sulfur protein allele from a carboxin resistant strain revealed a two base difference between the sequences. This mutation led to the substitution of a leucine residue for a histidine residue within the third cysteine rich cluster of the deduced amino acid sequence of the carboxin resistant strain allele. This cluster, which is associated with the S3 iron redox center, is involved in the transport of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone. Confirmation that this nucleotide change led to enhanced resistance to carboxin was obtained following mutagenesis of the sensitive iron sulfur protein allele to the resistant form and expression of the mutated allele in Ustaligo maydis."

An adsorption Fruendlich coefficient of 0.78 with a 1/n value of 0.93 was calculated from the adsorption data using linear regression on log transformed data. The desorption isotherm had a Fruendlich coefficient of 1.1 with 1/n of 0.94. The organic carbon content of the soil was 1.09%, corresponding to a Koc of 71(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this Koc value suggests that carboxin is expected to have high mobility in soil(SRC). Twenty inches of water was eluted through a 12 inch column of a clay loam soil to which 14C labeled carboxin had been applied(1). Fifty-two percent of the applied radioactivity and 41% of the applied carboxin were found in the leachate. Thirty-eight percent of the radioactivity remained in the column and ten percent of the radioactivity could not be accounted for at the end of the study(1). This soil column leaching study suggests that carboxin is highly mobile(SRC)."

It was found that carboxin was taken up better by the roots of bean plants than oxycarboxin. Radioautography indicated apoplastic movement of both fungicides, leading to marginal accumulation in transpiring leaves, with no redistribution between organs up to 14 days after treatment cessation. Carboxin was rapidly oxidized in roots to the non-fungitoxic sulfoxide, while oxycarboxin persisted in root and leaf extracts for up to 21 days. The majority of the label in roots was acetone-insoluble, indicating binding to plant polymers, while in leaves, a smaller proportion was insoluble. Analysis showed that the carboxamide linkage in carboxin was hydrolyzed in roots, producing aniline, which bound to plant polymers and formed water-soluble conjugation products. These findings were confirmed by chemotherapy studies with bean rust, confirming the translocation, distribution, and decomposition patterns of the fungicides.",
