It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.1 (carboxylesterase) inhibitor, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a plant metabolite, a Daphnia galeata metabolite, a solvent, an antioxidant and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an oleate. It derives from a hydride of a cis-octadec-9-ene.",

            "Value": "Insulin resistance is linked with a cluster of multiple risk factors and excessive acceleration of atherosclerosis. The underlying mechanism is not, however, fully understood. To determine the link between insulin resistance and altered vascular function, we focused on the effect of various non-esterified fatty acids on diacylglycerol-protein kinase C pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells. Incubation of the cells with saturated non-esterified fatty acids (200 micromol/L) for 24 hr, such as palmitate or stearate, induced a significant increase in diacylglycerol concentrations by about fivefold or eightfold, respectively, whereas oleate induced a slight increase in diacylglycerol concentrations by 1.8-fold and arachidonate induced none. In addition, the increased diacylglycerol concentrations induced by palmitate were completely restored to control concentrations by triacsin C, acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor. These results suggest that saturated non-esterified fatty acids may increase diacylglycerol concentrations through de novo pathway by stepwise acylation. In parallel with the increased diacylglycerol, incubation of the cells with saturated non-esterified fatty acids significantly induced the activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase. The palmitate-induced increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was restored to control concentrations by GF109203X (5 x 10(-7) mol/L), a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting a protein kinase C-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Saturated non-esterified fatty acids induced an increase in de novo diacylglycerol synthesis and subsequent activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells. This could contribute to the altered vascular functions in the insulin resistant state."

To investigate acute and chronic effects of different concentrations of FFAs on insulin secreting function of pancreas islet beta-cells, /Investigators/  determined the acute and chronic effects of FFAs on insulin secretion dynamics of isolated rat islets. The insulinotropic effects of four D-glucose concentrations (Nil, 5.6, 8.3 and 27.7 mM) were studied in freshly isolated and perifused islets in the presence of two different concentrations (250 micromol/L and 1,250 micromol/L) of three FFAs (palmitate, stearate and oleate) to determine the acute effects. Chronic effects were investigated similarly on islet cells incubated for 72 hours in the presence of nil, 250 micromol/L and 1,250 micromol/L concentrations of FFAs. There was only a slight increase in insulin secretion at both concentrations of FFAs in freshly isolated islets, and the recovery was complete with a slight decrease in pathologic FFA channel. However, after 72 hour incubation at physiological or higher concentrations of FFAs, insulin secretion was significantly lower, even in the presence of high levels of D-glucose when compared to either nil channel results, or results of the fresh samples. Insulin levels of recovery phase were slightly but significantly lower in physiological and pathologically high FFA conditions when compared to nil condition. In addition, first phase insulin release response was lost in these islets. FFAs slightly increased the insulin output of normal fresh pancreas beta-cells.

Oleic acid was detected in sediment from lake Jusan and Mutsu Bay, in Japan(2). Oleic acid was detected in sediment in 4 of 7 sites in the German Bight area(3)."

            "Value": "The Koc of undissociated oleic acid is estimated as 340,000(SRC), using a log Kow of 7.64(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that oleic acid is expected to be immobile in soil. The pKa of oleic acid is 5.02(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
