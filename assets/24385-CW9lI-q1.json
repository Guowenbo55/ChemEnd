Eighteen female albino rats were administered a single subcutaneous dose of 200 nickel chloride. A second group of 24 rats was divided into four subgroups and given 50, 100, 200, and 400 uM/kg nickel chloride. Increased lipid peroxidation and glutathione and iron concentrations were proportional to dose at 16 and 24 hr. Glutathione peroxidase activity decreased at the low dose but rose at higher nickel chloride concentrations. Lipid peroxidation was inhibited by exogenous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium azide, ethanol, sodium benzoate, and histidine, but was unaffected by superoxide benzoate, and histidine, but was unaffected by superoxide-dismutase and catalase. The administration of Ni resulted in the accumulation of hepatic iron and glutathione peroxidase activity."

The drugs were injected sc (20 rats/dose) with 250, 500, and 1000 umol/kg 60 min after a single sc injection of NiCl2 (500 umol/kg) that caused 100% mortality within 6 hr. At a 1:0.5 mol (nickel:chelating drug) all drugs reduced mortality. To compare the ability of the drugs to enhance urinary excretion, groups (n= 5) were injected with (63) Ni (250 umol Ni/kg containing 400 uCi) 60 min prior to injection of 500 umol of chelator (saline as a control). With the exception of glutathione effects on urinary Ni excretion, all drugs significantly (p< 0.05) enhanced urinary and biliary excretion of Ni. Urinary excretion of Ni at 72 hr was highest for cyclam. To compare the efficacy of the drugs in reducing Ni body burden and the comparative affinity for other trace metals, 8 rats were treated with 500 umol Ni/kg body wt 60 min prior to injection of chelator at 1:0.5, 1:1, or 1:2 ratios. The animals were killed 72 hr after injection and hepatic and renal Ni content determined. At all Ni:chelator ratios, cyclam was most effective at reducing liver and kidney Ni concentrations. At the highest ratio (1:2) triethylenetetraamine produced significant depletion (there was an increase in hepatic Zn) in liver and kidney trace metal (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) concentrations that were not observed with cyclam or cyclam s. The prophylactic effect of the drugs on Ni poisoning were studied by injecting chelator (1000 umol/kg) 60 min prior to 500 umol/kg of Ni (n= 40/chelator) and observing survival for 17 days (n= 20); 20 rats were given a second injection of Ni after 72 hr and survival observed for 14 days.

Other groups were exposed on successive days to both metals. After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice were administered 1.5 mg/kg of urethan ip. The mice were killed at the end of the 15 week period. Mice exposed to nickel or selenium showed no clinical toxicity and no difference in wt gain compared to controls. Sleep time induced by urethan (a measure of urethan metabolism and excretion) was significantly reduced by selenium exposure but not nickel exposure. Exposure to selenium alone did not significantly affect the size or number of urethan induced adenomas. Exposure to nickel alone increased adenoma size but had no effect on tumor number. Combined selenium and nickel exposure appeared to produce more tumors than the corresponding single metal exposure treatments. Interactions associated with tumor size and tumor number following combined selenium and nickel exposure, suggests that the immunological and carcinogenic or anticarcinogenic actions of nickel and selenium differ considerably from the corresponding mechanism controlling urethan induced carcinogenesis."

Equimolar concentrations of NTA did not enhance sister chromatid exchange induction by metals. The NTA/metal complexes, once formed, were genetically active at extremely low concentrations. The enhancement of the genetic activity was not pH dependent.
