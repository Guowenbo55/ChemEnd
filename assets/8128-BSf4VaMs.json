At a substrate concn of 40 mg/l and 20 \u00b0C, adiponitrile had theoretical CO2 evolutions of 10 and 60% after 2 and 9 days, respectively, in river die-away studies using unacclimated Ohio River water and sewage inocula(1); at 5 \u00b0C, theoretical CO2 evolution was 10 and 60% after 7.5 and 33 days, respectively(1). At 20 \u00b0C, effects of acclimation were examined by redosing at an initial substrate concn of 40 mg/l; the ratio of time it took to achieve 60% oxidation on 1st and 2nd feeding was 2.1 to 1(1). Adiponitrile was found to be toxic to one activated sludge unit after 72 hrs with a metal substrate concn of 500 mg/l; the other two sludge units had 2.2-2.8% theoretical BOD(2). Using a bench scale activated sludge unit, 93-98% BOD removal of adiponitrile was achieved using an influent concn equivalent to 275-350 mg/l BOD and a mean aeration retention time of 7-13 hours(3). Adiponitrile, present at 30 mg/l, reached 85% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 100 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(4). Microorganisms (Aeromonas sp.) isolated from soil were able to use adiponitrile as their sole source of carbon(5)."
