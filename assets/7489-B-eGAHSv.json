Terephthalic acid was determined to be biodegradable using the following biodegradation screening tests(2): Coupled Units (93% DOC, 1-day), Zahn-Wellens (93% DOC,4-days), Sturm Test (72% CO2 evolution, 28 days), Modified OECD Test (82% DOC, 19-day surface water die-away) and Closed Bottle Test (112% BODT, 30 days). Adaptation of microorganisms was found to accelerates the biodegradation of terephthalic acid(3); at the end of 24 days of acclimation of activated sludge, 96% of terephthalic acid at an initial concentration 1000 mg/l of COD biodegraded in 4 hrs(3). Complete loss of terephthalic acid occurred in 2 days from a soil suspension inoculum containing 20 ppm of the compound(4). Limited anaerobic biodegradation of terephthalic acid appeared to have occurred when industrial waste containing the compound was injected into a subsurface aquifer(5). In aerobic biodegradation tests using sludge collected from waste treatment plants, terephthalic acid had a biodegradation rate constant of 0.47/hour(6) which corresponds at a half-life of 1.5 hours(SRC). Terephthalic acid was found to be biodegradable in anaerobic digester tests at concentrations of 500 mg/L or less(7); higher concentrations could not be biodegraded completely(7).

Possible mechanisms of terephthalic acid induced urolithiasis were examined by daily oral administration of allopurinol, chlorothiazide, or neutral phosphates, at their recommended therapeutic doses during exposure to dietary 4.0% terephthalic acid. An additional group was fed 4.0% terephthalic acid and 4.0% sodium bicarbonate in the diet for two weeks. Chlorothiazide or dietary bicarbonate abolished terephthalic acid induced urolithiasis but allopurinol and neutral phosphates had no effect. Bicarbonate increased water intake above that of positive controls and ameliorated the terephthalic acid induced aciduria. It also increased urinary magnesium and terephthalic acid above positive control values. Chlorothiazide reduced urinary calcium and terephthalic acid levels below those of positive controls. Treatment with chlorothiazide neutral phosphates or bicarbonate slightly reduced serum calcium below the levels in either positive or negative controls.

A high incidence of calculi was induced in weanling rats but the incidence was much lower in adult rats ingesting the same dietary concentration of the chemical. The dose response curves for the induction of urolithiasis in weanling rats were extremely steep, consistent with the fact that the formation calculi can occur in urine that is supersaturated but not in urine that is undersaturated with respect to the stone components. In the cases of terephthalic acid and dimethyl terephthalate stones were composed primarily of calcium terephthalate. By determining the solubility of calcium terephthalate the concentration of terephthalic acid that would be required to achieve urinary saturation was calculated and a conservative estimate of the amount of terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate that would have to be absorbed in order to induce calculi was derived. Terephthalic acid and melamine induced bladder tumors in rats in chronic feeding studies. However, it is likely that these tumors were secondary to the development of calculi. Terephthalic acid and melamine are apparently nongenotoxic and they do not appear to be metabolized. Increased cell replication in the urothelium of the bladder caused by chronic physical injury was probably a major factor in the mechanism of induction of bladder tumors by bladder stones. Bladder neoplasms occurred primarily in the high dose groups, and they were usually, although not invariably associated with stones. The possibility that stones were passed or were lost during processing of tissues for histopathologic examination could explain the absence of calculi from some of the neoplastic bladders.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ /Terephthalic acid (TPA) was given daily in feed to CD and Wistar rats at doses of 0, 0.03, 0.125, 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0%.  Paternal exposure period was 90 days prior to and throughout mating.  Maternal exposure period was 90 days prior to mating, throughout mating, gestation, and lactation. Offsrping were exposed for 51 days; from birth through lactation and 30 days post weaning./ Parental Effects: Following 90 days of exposure to TPA, statistically significant decreases in food consumption were observed in CD females treated with 2% and 5%, and in both sexes of Wistars treated with 5%. Body weights were statistically decreased after 13 weeks in both sexes of CD rats on 2% and 5% TPA diets, and in males exposed to 0.03%. This effect occurred in Wistars (both sexes) only at the 5% level. There were 5 deaths (3 CD females, 1 Wistar/sex) reported during weeks 4-13 in animals given 5% TPA in the diet. During the one-generation component of the study 3 CD (1 male at 2.0%, 1/sex at 5.0%) and 4 Wistar female (2 at 5.0% and 2 at 0.03%) rats died. There was no effect of treatment on fertility index and litter size. Offspring Effects: There were no effects of treatment on litter size, sex ratio, or total number of offspring. While no control offspring were found dead on Day 0, 17 Wistar pups (1 at 0.03%, 2 at 0.125%, 1 at 0.5%, 12 at 2.0% (2 from one dam and 10 from another)) and 23 CD pups (1 at 0.5%, 7 at 2.0% (3 dams) and 15 at 5.0% (3 dams; with 11 from one of them)) were found dead. No statistical differences were noted in viability on Days 0, 1, or 21 in either strain. In CD rats, survivability on Day 21 was reduced in both sexes of offspring whose parents had been exposed to 5% TPA in the diet. In Wistar rats, body weights of both sexes of offspring from dams given 5.0% were reduced at Day 1. On Day 21, body weight was reduced in both strains of offspring from dams that ingested 5% TPA in the diet. Increased postnatal deaths on Day 1 and decreased survivability to Day 21 were noted in the 2% and 5% groups. At these dose levels, several large litters of pups were lost to dams suffering obvious signs of toxicity. Several of these dams did not allow the pups to nurse or attend to the litters. These pups were noted not to have milk in their stomachs and presented clinically as being very weak. These dams were consuming dietary levels of TPA known to cause reduced feed consumption, diarrhea and gastric trichobezoars (hairballs) and induce the formation of renal and bladder calculi. Unscheduled deaths during the postweaning period (Day 21-51) were confined to the 5% TPA group (18 Wistar and 16 CD) and were associated with a very high incidence of renal and bladder calculi. Renal and bladder calculi were noted in all animals exposed to 5% that were necropsied at Day 21. Day 51 necropsy findings also reported a very high incidence of renal and bladder calculi and the histological sequelae of the presence of the calculi. Parental NOAEL: 0.5% (CD); Wistar: 2.0%; Reproductive NOAEL: > 5.0% (CD and Wistar); F1 Offspring NOAEL: 0.5% (CD and Wistar)"

Fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining, and flow cytometry were used to assess the toxicity of PTA wastewater on spermatogenic cells. PTA wastewater induced significant variations in the relative percentages of immature haploid, diploid, tetraploid and S-phase spermatogonia. Percentage of viable spermatogenic cells was reduced from 93.1+/-2.3 in control group to 90.4+/-1.9 in the wastewater-treated group. Testicular histopathology revealed expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells induced by the wastewater, which was further certified by the decrease (10.6%) in relative testes weight and the increase (101.3%) in sperm shape abnormality in the wastewater-treated group. In this study, PTA wastewater was found to have reproductive toxicity on male mice, and public health problems may potentially arise from the discharge of the wastewater into the environment."

The rats were exposed 6 hr/day, on gestation days 6 through 15. The time-weighted average concentrations were 0, 0.9, 4.7, and 10.4 mg/cu m for the filtered air control, low, medium, and high exposure groups, respectively. No deaths occurred and no signs of maternal toxicity were observed during the study. No statistically significant differences in mean dam body or uterus weights, litter weights, dam body weight gain or pup viability were detected in the purified terephthalic acid exposed rats compared to filtered air controls. External and soft tissue examinations failed to show any significant increase in the incidence of fetal malformations or abnormalities in the purified terephthalic acid-exposed litters compared to the controls. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with rib anomalies was detected in the 5.0 mg/cu m group only when all rib anomalies were collapsed together. However, this increase was not considered a teratogenic event since the anomalies seen were common variations that were not elevated in a dose-related manner, were consistent with in house historical control values, and no other signs of embryotoxicity were evident in the purified terephthalic acid-exposed groups. Therefore, exposure to 1.0, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/cu m of purified terephthalic acid did not result in significant toxic or teratogenic effects in the dam or fetus."

The mice liver total RNA was isolated as the temple for synthesis of cDNA and then the cDNA as the temple for synthesis of cRNA. Hybridizing the cRNA with the target genes on the gene chip, there were 232 genes expression levels up-regulated and 74 genes down-regulated discovered obviously. The foremost 40 genes for both the highest and the lowest expression levels involved endogenetic steroid and hormone metabolism, immune system, the leukocyte activity and inflammation, detoxification in liver, reproduction and growth hormone, regulation immune factors of anti-tumor and anti-infection and cancer to the mice sampled.

The suppression of LDL receptor binding and degradation by the drug suggest that less apoB lipoproteins are taken up by peripheral tissues. The elevated HDL receptor binding and internalization in the liver suggest that the drug accelerates cholesterol return to the liver. Additional studies show that cholesterol and bile acid secretion in the bile is elevated. However, the bile acids secreted are not lithogenic."
