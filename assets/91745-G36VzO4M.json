            "content": "A pressure chamber technique was employed to investigate the root uptake and xylem translocation of nonradiolabeled cinmethylin and its analogs in detopped soybean (Glycine max) roots. Gas chromatography analysis with mass spectrometry detection under selected ion monitoring was used for compound quantification. The compounds, with octanol-water partition coefficients (log Kow values) from 0.96 to 5.3, were nonionizable under the experimental conditions. Root efflux curves showed a steady-state kinetic profile, and the time to reach steady-state efflux correlated with log Kow values, similar to the root binding profile. The transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) exhibited a nonlinear relationship with log Kow values, with the highest TSCF values between 0.6 to 0.8 for compounds with log Kow between 2.5 to 3.5. Adjusting for soil binding, the apparent optimal log Kow value for root-to-shoot translocation was around 1. The study also discussed the relationship between root-to-shoot and phloem translocation, aiming to enhance the understanding of soil-applied xenobiotic uptake and translocation at the whole plant level.",

(annual ryegrass). To date, there have been no confirmed cases of cinmethylin resistance identified in this species, but some populations exhibit reduced sensitivity to this herbicide. To explore the mechanism which contributes to reduced sensitivity of annual ryegrass to cinmethylin, the extent and nature of cinmethylin metabolism, using carbon-14 (14C)-labelled herbicide, were analysed in three reduced-sensitivity annual ryegrass populations, alongside a susceptible population and cinmethylin-tolerant wheat as controls.\nResults: All samples showed the same metabolite profile, with the extent of production of a specific water-soluble metabolite being correlated to the level of herbicide sensitivity. Application of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor phorate caused a decrease in water-soluble metabolite production as well as seedling growth in the presence of cinmethylin, indicating that reduced cinmethylin sensitivity in annual ryegrass could be wholly or partially due to oxidative modification of cinmethylin.\nConclusion: Because annual ryegrass has the potential to metabolize cinmethylin in the same way as wheat, careful stewardship is required to ensure the longevity of this herbicide.",
