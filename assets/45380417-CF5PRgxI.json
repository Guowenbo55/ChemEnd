    "Description": "Pyraoxystrobin is an enoate ester that is the methyl ester of (2E)-2-[2-({[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]oxy}methyl)phenyl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid. A broad spectrum fungicide used to control a variety of diseases on rice, vegetables and teas. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an enoate ester, an enol ether, an aromatic ether, a member of pyrazoles, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a methyl ester and a methoxyacrylate strobilurin antifungal agent.",

Pyraoxystrobin, when applied foliarly, showed rapid penetration into the treated leaf, reaching a substantial uptake of 68% within 5 days. Interestingly, the absorbed pyraoxystrobin exhibited both upward (acropetal) and downward (basipetal) translocation in the cucumber seedlings. However, the majority, over 74%, remained confined within the treated leaves. The distribution sequence within the plant showcased a pattern from the treated leaf to various plant parts, indicating its systemic movement. Seedlings grown in soils containing bound residues of pyraoxystrobin revealed limited absorption or translocation through the roots. Soil type significantly impacted root uptake, with the highest absorption observed in red clay. This systemic behavior indicates that foliar applications of pyraoxystrobin could potentially influence various parts of the cucumber plant within a short period, emphasizing the need for further investigation to assess any potential environmental or health risks.",
