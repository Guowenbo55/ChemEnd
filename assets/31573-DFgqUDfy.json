Their difference in electron transport inhibition during photosynthesis was identified as a factor influencing their phytotoxic effects, which varied between plant species. While barnyardgrass and the rice cultivar Choseng Tongil showed little difference in growth response between simetryn and dimethametryn, the Nihonbare rice cultivar exhibited greater tolerance to simetryn but relatively low tolerance to dimethametryn. In an experiment, two rice cultivars, Nihonbare and Choseng Tongil, and barnyardgrass were exposed to simetryn or dimethametryn at a concentration of 10-5M, chosen based on previous observations of differential phytotoxicity. The absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-labeled simetryn and dimethametryn were compared to elucidate the mechanism underlying the herbicides' differential phytotoxic activity.",
