    "Description": "Dazomet is a dithiocarbamic ester that is 1,3,5-thiadiazinane with a thione moiety at position 2 and in which the hydrogens attached to the nitrogens are replaced by methyl groups. A fungicide, herbicide and nematicide, it is used prior to sowing or planting for the control of soil fungi, nematodes, bacteria and germinating weeds, and as fumigant for poultry litter and eggs to control Salmonella. It is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to methyl bromide. It has a role as a herbicide, a nematicide, an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a dithiocarbamic ester and a thiadiazinane.",

            "Value": "An estimated BCF of 2.4 was calculated for dazomet(SRC), using a log Kow of 0.63(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In addition, dazomet is rapidly hydrolyzed in both fresh and salt water(4) and is not expected to be present for sufficient periods of time for bioconcentration(SRC)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Dazomet, present at 100 mg/L, reached 4% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(1). The rate of disappearance of dazomet from both an unamended and sterilized Williamson silt loam was identical, indicating that the initial phase of degradation in soil occurred predominantly from nonenzymatic mechanisms(2). The rate of degradation of dazomet in soil, as measured by the release of methyl isothiocyanate, was found to be independent of the soil microorganisms present(3)."
