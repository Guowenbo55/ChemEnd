It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide and a pyrethroid ester acaricide. It is an organochlorine compound, an organofluorine compound and a cyclopropanecarboxylate ester. It is functionally related to a cis-chrysanthemic acid.",

Nanoparticles (NPs) are now being used extensively and can enter soil, but their effects on the translocation of pesticides from soil to vegetables and the mechanisms involved are not well understood. This study investigated the simultaneous addition of bifenthrin (200 g/kg) and nano CuO (0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg) to soil for cultivating rape (Brassica napus L.) to determine the influence of nano CuO on the translocation of bifenthrin to the plant. Results showed that the highest concentration of bifenthrin in rape roots on day 40 reached 111.6 ng/g in the treatment with 100 mg/kg nano CuO, which was 1.65 times higher than that in the single bifenthrin treatment. This indicates that a high concentration of nano CuO (100 mg/kg) in soil promoted the absorption of bifenthrin by rape roots. The increased accumulation of CuO in the roots resulted in cell membrane lipid peroxidation and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), leading to higher electrolytic leakage in root tissue and root damage. Consequently, extra bifenthrin may enter rape plants through the damaged roots. These findings underscore the importance of considering plant physiology and the effects of mixtures when studying the accumulation of NPs and pesticides in plants.",
