Actually, sorbic acid (SA) is known to influence background excretion of t,t-MA in man, but only a few examples suggest that SA ingestion can enhance t,t-MA levels occurring together with benzene exposure. In this study, the effect of SA was investigated in benzene-exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 1 ppm benzene for 6 hr. Exposed animals had a 24-hr urinary t,t-MA excretion higher than that observed in non-exposed animals (87+/-13 ug/kg vs 19+/-3 ug/kg body weight). The oral dose of 8 mg/kg body weight SA had no effect on urinary t,t-MA both in control and in benzene-exposed rats. Increases of t,t-MA levels in urine occurred at SA doses of 50-200 mg/kg body weight, and co-exposure to benzene and SA (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) produced additive enhancement of t,t-MA excretion. These data demonstrate the dose-response relationship between SA administration and t,t-MA excretion. Our study showed that SA ingestion at doses equal to or greater than 50 mg/kg body weight significantly affects the t,t-MA urinary levels in rats exposed to 1 ppm of benzene for 6 hr. These data support the conclusion that in man t,t-MA is not suitable for biomonitoring of low levels of benzene exposure."

This finding was considered as toxicologically not relevant. In females, body weights were slightly to moderately increased from 25,000 ppm onwards as compared to the control, indicating sex-specific differences to the males. In both sexes, food intake was constantly lower as compared to the control, indicating weight compensation or even over-compensation through the relatively high caloric substitution via sorbic acid in the diet. The clinical pathology and organ weight data indicate sex-specific metabolic involvement of sorbic acid during the elimination process, which involved the lipid metabolism, transport proteins and liver weights in females, but not in males. In males, the only clinical pathology finding was a slight increase in ALP isoenzyme activity, suggesting a slightly different metabolic pathway for this sex. Therefore it is important to note that none of these metabolic changes identified in clinical pathology and organ weight evaluation in either males or females did result in any histopathologically evident target organ toxicity. These findings due to test compound-induced metabolic changes proved to be toxicologically insignificant in this test system."

The conjugated fatty acids, including CLA, are multifunctional bioactive fatty acids with the ability to improve growth performance. The effect of SA on pig growth performance was examined to determine its mechanism of action. The ADG, ADFI, and serum IGF-I concentration were examined, as were IGF-I secretion and IGF system gene expression in hepatocytes. Two hundred forty 21-d-old Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire weaned piglets (6.86 +/- 0.02 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each consisting of 3 pens of 20 piglets (10 female and 10 male). The 4 groups of piglets were kept in a temperature-controlled room (26 to 28 \u00b0C), and feed and water were provided to the pigs ad libitum. Weanling piglets were fed diets that included 0, 0.5, 2, or 4 g of SA/kg for 42 d. The diet supplemented with 0.5 g/kg of SA improved (p<0.05) ADG, BW, and G:F, whereas supplementation with all 3 SA doses increased (p<0.05) ADG and G:F at 21 to 42 d of age. The greatest concentration of plasma triglycerides was observed (p<0.05) in the 4 g/kg of SA group. The SA increased (0.5 g of SA/kg, p>0.05; 1 g of SA/kg, p<0.05; and 2 g of SA/kg, p<0.05, respectively) plasma total serum protein and globulin concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. It was noted that the smallest SA treatment dose (0.5 g/kg) dramatically increased (p<0.05) serum IGF-I concentration but decreased (p<0.05) the concentrations of blood urea N and cortisol. The SA increased (p<0.05) IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), and PPARalpha gene mRNA expression and IGF-I secretion, but not (p>0.05) IGFBP or PPARgamma mRNA expression, in pig primary hepatocytes. These results indicate that SA improves growth performance by regulating IGF system gene expression and hormone secretion."

Maternal findings in the mid dose group included increased respiratory rate following administration, decreased body weight gain and rough surface of the spleen. Maternal findings in high dose females included increased respiratory rate following administration, death, abortion, decreased body weight and body weight gain, marked decrease in food consumption and pathological findings upon necropsy (rough surface and reduced size of the spleen). Statistically significant reductions in mean fetal and placental weights and the viability of the fetuses were observed at the mid and high dose levels. At 1000 mg/kg bw/day, marginal statistically significantly increased incidences of unclassified macroscopic variations (abdominal distension caused by an inflated gastric tract) and skeletal variations (less than 7 lumber vertebral bodies ossified) occurred. Abdominal distension was noted in two dams where all fetuses were affected and was regarded as not test item-related. At the high dose level, causing severe maternal toxicity, increased post-implantation loss, severely reduced viability of fetuses, increased incidences of malrotated fore paws, domed head, accessory 13th ribs, skeletal retardations according to Dawson and soft tissue variations of the head according to Wilson were recorded. However, it did not appear justified to draw any valid conclusion on teratogenic properties at the highest dose level of this study. Slight or severe maternal toxicity observed at the mid and high dose level, respectively, and severely reduced food consumption at both dose levels indicated malnutrition. This normally results in inadequate intake of calcium and micronutrients like trace elements and vitamins, which are required for normal development of the fetuses. The malnutrition resulted in premature death of dams, retarded development of the fetuses and reduced viability of fetuses in the highest dose group. As a reason, it was considered that sorbic acid was administered over the test period by single gastric intubations per day. Necropsy revealed gastric lesions in all deceased animals. Since sorbic acid is known to have irritant properties, such lesions are probably attributable to administration of a large quantity of the irritant test article by gastric intubation. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that administration of large quantities of an antimicrobial substance resulted in disturbance of the intestinal microflora which, in turn, would result in deficiencies in nutrients, in particular for rabbits species. It should, in contrast, be noted that in feeding studies for rodents and dogs (with human-like intestinal function), high doses of sorbic acid are well tolerated, which supports these conclusions."

The reason for this effect remains unknown, however nutritional deficiencies in the pups masked by caloric overcompensation in lactating females might be an explanation.

Unscheduled deaths and clinical signs in F1 weanlings selected for mating (observed for 5 juveniles at 3000 mg/kg bw/day and one juvenile at 1000 mg/kg bw/day) during early pre-mating period is not uncommon in oral (gavage) reproduction toxicity studies. When administering excessive dose levels to juveniles as in this case, intolerance to oral gavage treatment often is a more important aspect rather than toxic effects induced by the test compound itself - findings that would not be necessarily seen in a corresponding dietary (feeding) study. Hence, these deaths may also be considered as incidental and not treatment related, and therefore of no toxicological relevance."

            "Value": "/GENOTOXICITY/ When mice were fed a diet containing 15% sorbic acid for a period of up to 6 months, ether extracts of the intestinal contents of the mice were not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but the acidic components obtained by fractionating the ether extracts showed slight mutagenic activity after the addition of a liver 9000-g supernatant metabolic activation system. These results suggested that mutagens were gradually produced in the intestine and moved into the liver where they were metabolically activated."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The weak organic acid sorbic acid is a commonly used food preservative, as it inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds. We have used genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Bacillus subtilis cells during mild sorbic acid stress to reveal the growth-inhibitory activity of this preservative and to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Our analysis demonstrated that sorbic acid-stressed cells induce responses normally seen upon nutrient limitation. This is indicated by the strong derepression of the CcpA, CodY, and Fur regulon and the induction of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, SigL- and SigH-mediated genes, and the stringent response. Intriguingly, these conditions did not lead to the activation of sporulation, competence, or the general stress response. The fatty acid biosynthesis (fab) genes and BkdR-regulated genes are upregulated, which may indicate plasma membrane remodeling. This was further supported by the reduced sensitivity toward the fab inhibitor cerulenin upon sorbic acid stress. ..."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Bacillus subtilis spores are a problem for the food industry as they are able to survive preservation processes. The spores often reside in food products, where their inherent protection against various stress treatments causes food spoilage. Sorbic acid is widely used as a weak acid preservative in the food industry. Its effect on spore germination and outgrowth in a combined, 'hurdle', preservation setting has gained limited attention. Therefore, the effects of mild sorbic acid (3 mM), heat-treatment (85 \u00b0C for 10 min) and a combination of both mild stresses on germination and outgrowth of B. subtilis 1A700 spores were analyzed at single spore level. The heat-treatment of the spore population resulted in a germination efficiency of 46.8% and an outgrowth efficiency of 32.9%. In the presence of sorbic acid (3 mM), the germination and outgrowth efficiency was 93.3% and 80.4% respectively whereas the combined heat and sorbic acid stress led to germination and outgrowth efficiencies of 52.7% and 27.0% respectively. The heat treatment clearly primarily affected the germination process, while sorbic acid affected the outgrowth and generation time. In addition a new 'burst' time-point was defined as the time-point at which the spore coat visibly breaks and/or is shed. The combined stresses had a synergistic effect on the time of the end of germination to the burst time-point, increasing both the mean and its variation more than either of the single stresses did."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Sorbic acid (SA) is widely used as a preservative, but the effect of SA on spore germination and outgrowth has gained limited attention up to now. Therefore, the effect of sorbic acid on germination of spores of Bacillus cereus strain ATCC 14579 was analyzed both at phenotype and transcriptome level. Spore germination and outgrowth were assessed at pH 5.5 without and with 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mM (final concentrations) undissociated sorbic acid (HSA). This resulted in distinct HSA concentration-dependent phenotypes, varying from reduced germination and outgrowth rates to complete blockage of germination at 3.0 mM HSA. The phenotypes reflecting different stages in the germination process could be confirmed using flow cytometry and could be recognized at transcriptome level by distinct expression profiles. In the absence and presence of 0.75 and 1.5 mM HSA, similar cellular ATP levels were found up to the initial stage of outgrowth, suggesting that HSA-induced inhibition of outgrowth is not caused by depletion of ATP. Transcriptome analysis revealed the presence of a limited number of transcripts in dormant spores, outgrowth related expression, and genes specifically associated with sorbic acid stress, including alterations in cell envelope and multidrug resistance. ..."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc of sorbic acid can be estimated to be 9(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that sorbic acid is expected to have very high mobility in soil. A Koc of less than 1 was estimated for sorbic using an HPLC method(3). The pKa of sorbic acid is 4.76(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
