    "Description": "Carpropamid is a cyclopropylcarboxamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,2-dichloro-1-ethyl-3-methylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid with the amino group of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylamine. A rice fungicide with specific action against Pyricularia oryzae. It is not highly toxic to mammals but shows a moderate level of toxicity to birds, fish and earthworms. It has a role as an EC 4.2.1.94 (scytalone dehydratase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic, a melanin synthesis inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a cyclopropylcarboxamide, a member of monochlorobenzenes and an amide fungicide.",

When applied to the seed, carpropamid was not only readily absorbed but also translocated to different parts of the seedlings emerging from treated seeds. A substantial portion of the fungicide appeared to be exuded onto the leaf surface. In 21-day-old plants grown from [^14C]carpropamid-treated seeds, 27.2% of the radioactivity isolated from leaves was present on the surface of the lamina. This exuded fraction is probably responsible for its action as a fungal anti-penetrant compound. Following a 30-minute root dipping of 14-day-old seedlings, carpropamid was rapidly absorbed and translocated throughout the seedling. Its intralamellar distribution was uniform as determined by autoradiography. Only a small fraction (<2%) of the fungicide applied to the foliage was translocated beyond the site of application within the treated leaf. Translocation was primarily apoplastic. Approximately 54% of the radioactivity recovered from leaves was in the form of carpropamid. At least seven radiolabeled metabolic products were observed by TLC. Only 8.3% of the radioactivity applied through the seeds could be recovered from 21-day-old seedlings.",
