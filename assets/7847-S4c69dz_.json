A log BCF of 2.54 (BCF = 347) was measured for acrolein in a bluegill sunfish based on the whole body weight(5). In another study, a BCF of 344 was measured for acrolein in bluegill sunfish(6). However, these measured values may be an overestimate since total (14)C was measured in the fish, which may have resulted in the measurement of acrolein metabolites(7)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: The half-life of acrolein in natural unsterilized water was 29 hours compared with 43 hours in sterilized (thymol-treated) water suggesting that biodegradation was partially responsible for the degradation(1). A loss of 100% was observed when 5 and 10 mg/L acrolein underwent a static incubation in the dark at 25 \u00b0C with sewage inoculum for 7 days(2). In another experiment, acrolein reached 30% of its theoretical BOD in river water after 100 hrs(3). It has been reported that acrolein is metabolized easily in soil, being mineralized to carbon dioxide(4). Results of other biodegradation screening studies also indicate that acrolein would be readily degraded by mixed microbial populations(5-7). In contrast, no BOD removal was observed during a 5-day BOD dilution test in which effluent from a biological waste treatment plant was used(8). Acrolein, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test, however, the acrolein formed 3-hydroxypropanal in the water(9) which is the hydration reaction product of acrolein in water(10). Field and laboratory studies using irrigation channels suggested that the degradation of the hydration product of acrolein, 3-hydroxypropanal, occurs after the concentration of acrolein falls below 2-3 ppm. The degradation of 3-hydroxypropanal was also preceded by a 100-hour lag period, suggesting that biodegradation was occurring through the action of acclimated cultures(11). In a laboratory study conducted in an aerobic sandy loam soil from Phoenix AZ, acrolein was completely gone within 8 hours in the nonsterile soils and within 115 hours in the sterilized soil. The biotransformation half-life in the nonsterile soil was calculated to be 4.2 hours and four products/intermediates were identified: acrylic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3-hydroxypropanal, and CO2(12). Transformation products (acrylic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid) were also readily biotransformed and were presumably converted to CO2 with a half-life of 29 days(12)."

Acrolein, at pathophysiological concentrations, caused a dose-dependent loss of viability of hepatocytes. The death was apoptotic at moderate and necrotic at high concentrations of acrolein. Acrolein exposure rapidly and dramatically decreased intracellular glutathione and overall antioxidant capacity, and activated the stress-signaling MAP-kinases JNK, p42/44 and p38. Our data demonstrate for the first time in human hepatocytes, that acrolein triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated eIF2alpha, ATF-3 and -4, and Gadd153/CHOP, resulting in cell death. Notably, the protective/adaptive component of ER stress was not activated, and acrolein failed to up-regulate the protective ER-chaperones, GRP78 and GRP94. Additionally, exposure to acrolein disrupted mitochondrial integrity/function, and led to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins and ATP depletion. Acrolein-induced cell death was attenuated by N-acetyl cysteine, phenyl-butyric acid, and caspase and JNK inhibitors. /The/ data demonstrate that exposure to acrolein induces a variety of stress responses in hepatocytes, including GSH depletion, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress (without ER-protective responses) which together contribute to acroleintoxicity. ..."

            "Value": "Neutrophils (PMNs) are key mediators of inflammatory processes throughout the body. In this study, we investigated the role of acrolein, a highly reactive aldehyde that is ubiquitously present in the environment and produced endogenously at sites of inflammation, in mediating PMN-mediated degradation of collagen facilitating proline-glycine-proline (PGP) production. We treated peripheral blood neutrophils with acrolein and analyzed cell supernatants and lysates for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and prolyl endopeptidase (PE), assessed their ability to break down collagen and release PGP, and assayed for the presence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and its ability to degrade PGP. Acrolein treatment induced elevated production and functionality of collagen-degrading enzymes and generation of PGP fragments. Meanwhile, LTA4H levels and triaminopeptidase activity declined with increasing concentrations of acrolein thereby sparing PGP from enzymatic destruction. These findings suggest that acrolein exacerbates the acute inflammatory response mediated by neutrophils and sets the stage for chronic pulmonary and systemic inflammation."

            "Value": "Acrolein, an endogenous aldehyde, has been shown to be involved in sensory hypersensitivity after rat spinal cord injury (SCI), for which the pathogenesis is unclear. Acrolein can directly activate a pro-algesic transient receptor protein ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel that exists in sensory neurons. Both acrolein and TRPA1 mRNA are elevated post SCI, which contributes to the activation of TRPA1 by acrolein and consequently, neuropathic pain. In the current study, we further showed that, post-SCI elevation of TRPA1 mRNA exists not only in dorsal root ganglias but also in both peripheral (paw skin) and central endings of primary afferent nerves (dorsal horn of spinal cord). This is the first indication that pain signaling can be over-amplified in the peripheral skin by elevated expressions of TRPA1 following SCI, in addition over-amplification previously seen in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, we show that acrolein alone, in the absence of physical trauma, could lead to the elevation of TRPA1 mRNA at various locations when injected to the spinal cord. In addition, post-SCI elevation of TRPA1 mRNA could be mitigated using acrolein scavengers. Both of these attributes support the critical role of acrolein in elevating TRPA1 expression through gene regulation. Taken together, these data indicate that acrolein is likely a critical causal factor in heightening pain sensation post-SCI, through both the direct binding of TRPA1 receptor, and also by boosting the expression of TRPA1. Finally, our data also further support the notion that acrolein scavenging may be an effective therapeutic approach to alleviate neuropathic pain after SCI. We propose that the trauma-mediated elevation of acrolein causes neuropathic pain through at least two mechanisms: acrolein stimulates the production of transient receptor protein ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in both central and peripheral locations, and it activates TRPA1 channels directly. Therefore, acrolein appears to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of post-SCI sensory hypersensitivity, becoming a novel therapeutic target to relieve both acute and chronic post-SCI neuropathic pain."

            "Value": "It is well known that traumatic injury in the central nervous system can be viewed as a primary injury and a secondary injury. Increases in oxidative stress lead to breakdown of membrane lipids (lipid peroxidation) during secondary injury. Acrolein, an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, together with other aldehydes, increases as a result of self-propagating lipid peroxidation. Historically, most research on the pathology of secondary injury has focused on reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than lipid peroxidation products. Little is known about the toxicology and cell death mediated by these aldehydes. .. This study ... investigated and characterized certain features of cell death induced by acrolein on PC12 cells as well as cells from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sympathetic ganglion in vitro. ... /A/ companion paper ... evaluated a possible means to interfere with this toxicity by application of a compound that can bind to and inactivate acrolein. ...

Cytoskeletal structures significantly deteriorated after exposure to 100 uM acrolein as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, whereas calpain activity increased significantly at this concentration. Cell viability assays indicated significant cell death with 100 uM acrolein by 4 hr. Caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation assays were performed and supported the notion that 100 uM acrolein induced PC12 cell death by the mechanism of necrosis, not apoptosis."

            "Value": "... As a toxic by-product of lipid peroxidation, acrolein has been implicated as a possible mediator of oxidative damage to cells and tissues in a wide variety of disease states, including atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative and pulmonary diseases. Although acrolein can induce apoptotic cell death in various cell types, the biochemical mechanisms are not understood. This study investigates the implication of the death receptor pathway in acrolein-induced apoptosis. Exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells to acrolein caused translocation of adaptor protein Fas associated with death domain to the cytoplasmic membrane and caspase-8 activation. Kp7-6, an antagonist of Fas receptor activation, blocked apoptotic events downstream of caspase-8, such as caspase-7 activation and nuclear chromatin condensation. Acrolein activated the cross-talk pathway between the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Bid was cleaved to truncated-Bid, which was translocated to mitochondria. Activation of the mitochondrial pathway by acrolein was confirmed by caspase-9 activation. Inhibition of activation of either the Fas receptor or caspase-8 partially decreased acrolein-induced caspase-9 activation. These findings indicate that acrolein activates the Fas receptor pathway, which occurs upstream of the mitochondrial pathway. Caspase-9 activation still occurred despite inhibition of the Fas receptor pathway, suggesting that acrolein could also trigger the mitochondrial pathway independent of the receptor pathway. ..."

            "Value": "Acrolein, an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, is by far the strongest electrophile present in cigarette smoke which is involved in several lung pathophysiological conditions. Acrolein depletes glutathione and creates thiol imbalance. Acrolein due to thiol imbalance as well as covalent modification of cysteine is known to inhibit the activity of redox sensitive transcription factors such as NF-kappaB and AP-1. Exposure of human type II lung epithelial (A549) cells to non-lethal dose of acrolein (150 fmol/cell for 1 hr) depletes 80% of intracellular glutathione and increases the transcription of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) at 6-12 hr post-treatment, which helps in replenishing the glutathione to normal level. Acrolein treatment activates transcription of phase II genes in general, as indicated by an increase in mRNA for NAD (P) H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Western blot analysis revealed the increased level of the transcription factor, Nrf2 in the nuclear extract from acrolein treated cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows increased binding of nuclear proteins to human antioxidant response element (ARE) consensus sequence after treatment with acrolein. The involvement of Nrf2 in ARE mediated transcriptional activation in response to acrolein exposure has been confirmed by human NQO1-ARE reporter assay. The ability of acrolein to transcriptionaly activate genes responsible for phase II enzymes may form the basis of resistance against cell death and can have implications in cigarette smoke related lung carcinogenesis."

The iNOS inhibitors significantly inhibited the acrolein-increased nitrite/nitrate levels, but not IL-6 levels. IL-6-neutralizing antibodies effectively inhibited the acrolein-increased /nitrogen oxide species/ levels.

Speckle tracking echocardiography revealed that circumferential strain delay (i.e., dyssynchrony) was increased at 1 and 24 hr following exposure to 3.0 ppm, but not 0.3 ppm, when compared to pre-exposure and/or FA exposure. Pulsed wave Doppler of transmitral blood flow revealed that acrolein exposure at 0.3 ppm, but not 3.0 ppm, increased the Tei index of myocardial performance (i.e., decreased global heart performance) at 1 and 24 hr post-exposure compared to pre-exposure and/or FA exposure.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Although lipid peroxidation has long been associated with spinal cord injury (SCI), the specific role of lipid peroxidation-derived byproducts such as acrolein in mediating damage remains to be fully understood. Acrolein, an alph-beta unsaturated aldehyde, is highly reactive with proteins, DNA, and phospholipids and is considered as a second toxic messenger that disseminates and augments initial free radical events. Previously, we showed that acrolein increased following traumatic SCI and injection of acrolein induced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that microinjection of acrolein into the thoracic spinal cord of adult rats resulted in dose-dependent tissue damage and functional deficits. At 24 hr (acute) after the microinjection, tissue damage, motoneuron loss, and spinal cord swelling were observed on sections stained with Cresyl Violet. Luxol fast blue staining further showed that acrolein injection resulted in dose-dependent demyelination. At 8 weeks (chronic) after the microinjection, cord shrinkage, astrocyte activation, and macrophage infiltration were observed along with tissue damage, neuron loss, and demyelination. These pathological changes resulted in behavioral impairments as measured by both the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and grid walking analysis. Electron microscopy further demonstrated that acrolein induced axonal degeneration, demyelination, and macrophage infiltration. These results, combined with our previous reports, strongly suggest that acrolein may play a critical causal role in the pathogenesis of SCI ... ."

In addition, differential cell counts and histological analysis revealed an increase in bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils in animals exposed to both OVA and ACR. However, exposure to both OVA and ACR did not influence mRNA expression of the cytokines il5, il10, il13 or tnfa, but significantly increased mRNA expression of ccl20. Moreover, ACR exposure enhanced lung mRNA levels of il17f and tgfb1, suggesting development of enhanced inhalation tolerance to OVA.

A metabolic relationship exists between these chemicals in which allyl acetate is metabolized to allyl alcohol and subsequently to the highly reactive, alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, acrolein. Due to the weaker reactivity of the protoxicants, allyl acetate and allyl alcohol, relative to acrolein /it was/ hypothesized the protoxicants would attain greater systemic exposure and therefore deliver higher doses of acrolein to the internal organs.

Mice (10/group) were dosed with 0-125 mg/kg allyl acetate, 0-50 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0-20 mg/kg acrolein. The highest dose of allyl acetate and acrolein decreased survival in both mice and rats. The primary target organ for the toxicity of all three chemicals in both species and sexes was the forestomach; squamous epithelial hyperplasia was observed following exposure to each chemical. In both species the highest allyl acetate dose group exhibited forestomach epithelium necrosis and hemorrhage and the highest dose of acrolein led to glandular stomach hemorrhage. Liver histopathology was the most apparent with allyl acetate, was also observed with allyl alcohol, but was not observed with acrolein. All chemicals had effects on the hematopoietic system with allyl acetate having the most pronounced effect. When dosed at quantities limited by toxicity, allyl acetate and allyl alcohol produce higher levels of urinary mercapturic acids than the minimally toxic dose of acrolein. This observation is likely due to biotransformation of allyl acetate and ally alcohol to acrolein that occurs after absorption and suggests that these chemicals are protoxicants that increase systemic exposure of acrolein. Increased systemic exposure to acrolein is likely responsible for the differences in hepatic toxicological profile observed with these chemicals."

Semi-continuously exposed animals received half the dose of aldehydes in 8 hr/day, 5 days/week. Some mice in each group were sacrificed after 13 weeks of exposure; the rest breathed clean air until the end of 1 year. Mice injected intratracheally with benzo[a]pyrene formed a positive control group. The nasal cavity, lungs, and any macroscopically abnormal organs of all mice were analyzed histopathologically. After 13 weeks of exposure, the subacute, overall, histopathological changes induced by the inhalation differed noticeably between the intermittently and semi-continuously treated Xpa-/-p53+/- knock-out mice. After 13 weeks of mixed aldehyde exposure, atrophy of the olfactory epithelium generally appeared, but disappeared after 1 year (adaptation and/or recovery). Respiratory epithelial metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium occurred at a higher incidence at 1 year.

Majority of SHS (>80%) originates from side-stream smoke (SSS). Compared to mainstream smoke, SSS contains more tumorigenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and acrolein (Acr). We assessed SSS-induced benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)- and cyclic propano-deoxyguanosine (PdG) adducts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung, heart, liver, and bladder-mucosa from mice exposed to SSS for 16 weeks. In SSS exposed mice, Acr-dG adducts were the major type of PdG adducts formed in BAL (p<0.001), lung (p<0.05), and bladder mucosa (p<0.001), with no significant accumulation of Acr-dG adducts in heart or liver. SSS exposure did not enhance BPDE-DNA adduct formation in any of these tissues. SSS exposure reduced nucleotide excision repair (p<0.01) and base excision repair (p<0.001) in lung tissue. The levels of DNA repair proteins, XPC and hOGG1, in lung tissues of exposed mice were significantly (p<0.001 and p<0.05) lower than the levels in lung tissues of control mice. We found that Acr can transform human bronchial epithelial and urothelial cells in vitro. We propose that induction of mutagenic Acr-DNA adducts, inhibition of DNA repair, and induction of cell transformation are three mechanisms by which SHS induces lung and bladder cancers."

In this study the effects of acrolein on rat embryos cultured in the standard medium consisting of rat serum were assessed over a narrow-concentration range.

In the serum medium acrolein caused 100% embryolethality at 140 uM and was found to be teratogenic in the concentration range of 80-120 uM. In the serum-free medium acrolein was 100% embryolethal at 20 uM and was teratogenic in the range of 5-15 uM. The EC50 for malformations in the serum medium was 137 uM, whereas that for embryolethality was 115 uM; the EC50s for malformations and embryolethality in the serum-free medium were 2.8 uM and 8.3 uM, respectively.

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ Acrolein, an endogenous aldehyde, has been shown to be involved in sensory hypersensitivity after rat spinal cord injury (SCI), for which the pathogenesis is unclear. Acrolein can directly activate a pro-algesic transient receptor protein ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel that exists in sensory neurons. Both acrolein and TRPA1 mRNA are elevated post SCI, which contributes to the activation of TRPA1 by acrolein and consequently, neuropathic pain. In the current study, we further showed that, post-SCI elevation of TRPA1 mRNA exists not only in dorsal root ganglias but also in both peripheral (paw skin) and central endings of primary afferent nerves (dorsal horn of spinal cord). This is the first indication that pain signaling can be over-amplified in the peripheral skin by elevated expressions of TRPA1 following SCI, in addition over-amplification previously seen in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, we show that acrolein alone, in the absence of physical trauma, could lead to the elevation of TRPA1 mRNA at various locations when injected to the spinal cord. In addition, post-SCI elevation of TRPA1 mRNA could be mitigated using acrolein scavengers. Both of these attributes support the critical role of acrolein in elevating TRPA1 expression through gene regulation. Taken together, these data indicate that acrolein is likely a critical causal factor in heightening pain sensation post-SCI, through both the direct binding of TRPA1 receptor, and also by boosting the expression of TRPA1. Finally, our data also further support the notion that acrolein scavenging may be an effective therapeutic approach to alleviate neuropathic pain after SCI. We propose that the trauma-mediated elevation of acrolein causes neuropathic pain through at least two mechanisms: acrolein stimulates the production of transient receptor protein ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) in both central and peripheral locations, and it activates TRPA1 channels directly. Therefore, acrolein appears to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of post-SCI sensory hypersensitivity, becoming a novel therapeutic target to relieve both acute and chronic post-SCI neuropathic pain."

Furthermore, the enzyme activity of P450scc, the rate-limiting step of aldosterone synthesis, was elevated after acrolein injection. Plasma level of Ang II was increased in both A-1 and A-3 groups. These results suggested that acrolein exposure increased aldosterone production, at least in part, through elevating the level of plasma Ang II and stimulating steroidogenesis pathways."

In contrast to the results obtained with glutamate, malate, and malonate, with succinate as substrate no significant differences between allylamine and acrolein in concentration effect slopes were noted for State III, State IV and uncoupler stimulated activities, indicating site selectivity between the two compounds. Respiratory control ratios were significantly decreased by allylamine and acrolein with glutamate, malate, and malonate substrate. When succinate was used as substrate, the respiratory control ratio was significantly reduced only by acrolein, again suggesting the site selective nature of this compound."

Subsequent changes in local pulmonary immunity were determined by examining the number of antibody plaque-forming cells in the lung-associated lymph nodes following intratracheal immunization with sheep red blood cells. Separate groups of rats were evaluated for blastogenic responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin-P and Salmonella typhimurium antigen using spleen- and lung-associated lymph node cells. In vivo resistance was evaluated utilizing acrolein-exposed rats subsequently challenged with intravenous Listeria monocytogenes. Local pulmonary antibody responsiveness was not affected by acrolein exposure. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and resistance to Listeria challenge were not altered. Body weights and spleen weights were decreased in the 3 ppm-exposed group only. Microscopic examination of the nasal turbinates revealed acrolein-induced exfoliation, erosion, and necrosis of the respiratory epithelium as well as squamous metaplasia, however, lung histology was not affected. Thus at environmental concentrations, acrolein toxicity appeared to be confined to local nasal pathologic changes with no alterations in lung histology or immune function."

Based on .. previous findings that immunosuppressive effects of smoking may be largely attributed to one of its main reactive electrophiles, acrolein, ... the impact of acrolein exposure in a mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma /was explored/. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) by intraperitoneal injection with the adjuvant aluminum hydroxide on days 0 and 7, and challenged with aerosolized OVA on days 14-16. In some cases, mice were also exposed to 5 ppm acrolein vapor for 6 hr/day on days 14-17. Lung tissues or brochoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected either 6 hr after a single initial OVA challenge and/or acrolein exposure on day 14 or 48 hr after the last OVA challenge, on day 18. Inflammatory cells and Th1/Th2 cytokine levels were measured in BALF, and lung tissue samples were collected for analysis of mucus and Th1/Th2 cytokine expression, determination of protein alkylation, cellular thiol status and transcription factor activity. Exposure to acrolein following OVA challenge of OVA-sensitized mice resulted in markedly attenuated allergic airway inflammation, demonstrated by decreased inflammatory cell infiltrates, mucus hyperplasia and Th2 cytokines. Acrolein exposure rapidly depleted lung tissue glutathione (GSH) levels, and induced activation of the Nrf2 pathway, indicated by accumulation of Nrf2, increased alkylation of Keap1, and induction of Nrf2-target genes such as HO-1. Additionally, analysis of inflammatory signaling pathways showed suppressed activation of NF-kappaB and marginally reduced activation of JNK in acrolein-exposed lungs, associated with increased carbonylation of RelA and JNK. Acrolein inhalation suppresses Th2-driven allergic inflammation in sensitized animals, due to direct protein alkylation resulting in activation of Nrf2 and anti-inflammatory gene expression, and inhibition of NF-kappaB or JNK signaling. Our findings help explain the paradoxical anti-inflammatory effects of cigarette smoke exposure in allergic airways disease."

Polyamines, which produced acrolein in the presence of amine oxidase, were then found to react with acrolein to produce 1,5-diazacyclooctane, a previously unrecognized but significant downstream product of oxidative stress. Although diazacyclooctane formation effectively neutralized acrolein toxicity, the diazacyclooctane hydrogel produced through a sequential diazacyclooctane polymerization reaction was highly cytotoxic.

We examined the involvement of NAD(P)H oxidase and other oxidant system in acrolein toxicity using gp91phox knockout mice. Male gp91phox knockout (KO) mice (20-25 gm) or wild type (WT) controls were treated with acrolein (0.5 ug/kg; 1 week). Animals were sacrificed and the liver was used to determine biochemical parameters. Knockout mice generated low (1.43 +/- 0.02 pg/ug protein) free radicals as evident in 8-Isoprostane compared with the WT mice (2.19 +/- 0.1). Acrolein increased 8-Isoprostane in WT (p<0.05) and KO (p<0.05) mice. Xanthine Oxidase (XO) activity was higher (p<0.05) in KO (0.56 +/- 0.06 u unit/ug protein) than WT mice. Acrolein increased XO in KO mice, but significantly increased it only in WT. Cycloxygenase (COX) activity was not different between WT and KO mice, although acroelin increased COX in WT. Knockout mice exhibited a significantly low (2.1 +/- 0.2 umol/mg protein) total antioxidant status (TAS) compared with the WT (3.5 +/- 0.3). Acrolein reduced TAS in both WT and KO mice equally. Baseline NFkappaB was significantly higher in KO mice, although acrolein increased NFkappaB in WT but not in KO. CD36 was higher (p<0.05) in KO mice than the WT and acrolein increased (p<0.05) CD36 further in KO but not in WT mice. These data suggest that NAD(P)H oxidase contributes significantly in acrolein-induced oxidative stress. We also suggests that in the absence of NAD(P)H oxidase XO plays a definitive role together with reduced antioxidant ability to compound the toxic effects of acrolein. We propose that in absence of NAD(P)H oxidase a different signaling process may involve that utilizes CD36 besides NFkappaB."

Liver injury is believed to be initiated by metabolic conversion of acetaminophen to the highly reactive intermediate N-acetyl p-benzoquinoneimine, and is aggravated by subsequent oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the hydroxyl radical. In this study, we found that a highly toxic unsaturated aldehyde acrolein, a byproduct of oxidative stress, has a major role in acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Acetaminophen administration in mice resulted in liver damage and increased acrolein-protein adduct formation. However, both of them were decreased by treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), two known acrolein scavengers. The specificity of NAC and MESNA was confirmed in cell culture, because acrolein toxicity, but not H2O2 or hydroxyl radical toxicity, was inhibited by NAC and MESNA. These results suggest that acrolein may be more strongly correlated with acetaminophen-induced liver injury than ROS, and that acrolein produced by acetaminophen-induced oxidative stress can spread from dying cells at the primary injury site, causing damage to the adjacent cells and aggravating liver injury."

Here we investigated the effects of GADD34 on acrolein-induced lung injury. The intranasal exposure of acrolein induced the expression of GADD34, developing the pulmonary damage with inflammation and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, the integrality of pulmonary structure was preserved and the generation of ROS was reduced in GADD34-knockout mice. Acrolein-induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in GADD34-knockout epithelial cells by shRNA protected cell death by reducing misfolded protein-caused oxidative stress.

Because of potential human exposure, there is a need for a sensitive, reliable, and specific method to monitor acrolein exposure. Acrolein is a potent electrophile and reacts with proteins mainly through Michael addition reaction, leading to acrolein-protein adducts (APA). The present study aimed to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the quantitation of APA in biological samples. Antibody to acrolein-keyhole limpet hemocyanin adduct was raised in rabbits, and the specificity of the antibody was determined by ELISA using acrolein-albumin adduct (AAA) or native albumin. A dose-dependent response was observed with AAA, but no immunoreactivity with native albumin. Further, lack of cross-reactivity of anti-acrolein antibody with formaldehyde-, malondialdehyde-, or 4-hydroxynonenal-albumin adducts indicates its specificity for acrolein. For the competitive ELISA, 1:16,000 diluted antisera was used with varying concentrations of AAA, which provided a linear detection range between 250 and 10,000 pg. To test the efficacy of the method for possible use as a biomarker of acrolein exposure, SD rats were orally administered 1 or 7 doses of 9.2 mg/kg/d acrolein. APA levels, quantitated in the serum, showed significantly greater formation (32% and 58% after 1 and 7 doses, respectively) in acrolein-treated rats as compared to the controls. Western blot analyses of APA in the sera from acrolein-treated rats showed APA bands (especially 29, 31, and 100 kD) with greater intensity in comparison to controls, further supporting our ELISA results. These results suggest that quantitation of APA has potential to be used as biomarker of acrolein exposure and eventually for molecular dosimetry and risk assessment."

A statistically significant decline in UE occurred during the exposures. Exposure to acrolein vapor resulted in reduced respiratory epithelial GSH concentrations. In acrolein-preexposed animals, URT acrolein UE was also dependent on the acrolein concentration used prior to the uptake exposure, with preexposed rats having higher UE than their naive counterparts.

Supportive treatment was provided, but he experienced ventricular fibrillation and a grand mal seizure. He was eventually stabilized and discharged from the hospital but suffered ongoing medical conditions, including dysphagia and facial droop.Additional cases of acute acrolein-related illness were identified, mostly among workers employed by irrigation districts in California.  Acrolein is highly volatile and produces an extremely irritating vapor that can degrade cellular structures by cross-linking proteins.  Nonchemical methods to prevent clogging of irrigation canals have been considered but found not feasible. Proper training, certification, and adherence to safety procedures are necessary to prevent acrolein-related illnesses in workers. "
