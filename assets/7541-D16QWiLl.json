    "Description": "Anilazine is a member of the class of triazenes that is dichlorotriazene in which the hydrogen is replaced by an o-chloroanilino group. A fungicide formerly used to control leaf spots and downy mildew, it is no longer approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of triazines, an organochlorine pesticide, a secondary amino compound and a member of monochlorobenzenes.",

            "Value": "The incorporation and extractability of benzene-U-labeled and triazine-U-labeled 14C-dyrene in a German parabrown soil was studied over 100 days in a green house (16-27 \u00b0C)(1). The soil was extracted with a simulated soil solution (0.01 M CaCl2), as well as two different solvent mixtures on day 0, 6, 28 and 100. Thin-layer chromatography showed that the concn of dyrene in extracts decreased from approximately 30% of that applied on day-0 to 2-3% within 6 days and 1% on day-100(1). During this period, the concn of the main, and only identified, metabolite, dihydoxyanilazine, increased to about 3% of applied radioactivity. Another degradation experiment in which (benzene-U-ring 14C)dyrene and (triazine ring-U-14C)dihydroxyanilizine, the primary degradation product of dyrene, were incubated in an orthic luvisol soil at 22 \u00b0C found that <1% of the applied benzene ring carbon was mineralized and <8% of the triazine ring of dihydroxyanilizine were mineralized after 110 days(2). Mineralization increased only slightly when the incubation temperature was raised to 30 \u00b0C(2). Mineralization was not stimulated when dyrene was applied to the soil several times(2)."

            "Value": "When applied to soil, dyrene binds strongly to the organic components of soil. Several days after 14C-labeled dyrene was applied to soil, between 10 and 18.6% of the applied radioactivity was extractable(2,3). Thin-layer chromatography showed that the concn of dyrene in extracts decreased to 2-3% of that applied within 6 days(2). However, in one experiment, little or no mineralization occurred after 110 days(5). Therefore it is not clear to what extent degradation occurs compared with dyrene's being chemically bound to soil components(SRC). The recommended field half-life for dyrene, according to the USDA Pesticides Property Database is 1 day(4). The half-life of dyrene (100 ppm) in moist and air dried Glouchester loam soil (pH 6.4) when incubated in sealed jars at 26 \u00b0C was 0.5 and 2.5 days, respectively(1). Experiments were not conducted using sterile controls to ascertain whether the degradation was microbially induced."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that dyrene is expected to have slight mobility in soil. Additionally, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4), suggesting that mobility will be low in soils(SRC)."
