According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, 2-methylpyrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(3). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 2.08 days has been reported for the analogous compound pyrene(4)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with four or more rings, such as 2-methylpyrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(1). Biodegradation of the analogous compound pyrene is expected to occur slowly in soils, with estimated half-lives ranging from several weeks to years(2,3). Faster biodegradation rates occur with exposure to acclimated microbes(4). Soil microcosm studies using three industrial soils from Austria found pronounced biodegradation of pyrene in one soil (about 65-75% over 65 days of incubation), but only slight biodegradation in the other two soils(5)."
