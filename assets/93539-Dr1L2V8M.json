            "content": "Certain sulfonylurea (SU) herbicides are effective in removing overseeded cool-season species from bermudagrass. However, the impact of nitrogen (N) on the efficacy of the new SU herbicide, flazasulfuron, remains unknown. Field and laboratory studies conducted in 2008 and 2009 evaluated flazasulfuron's efficacy for controlling overseeded perennial ryegrass contaminated with annual bluegrass. Flazasulfuron was applied alone or in between sequential applications of N fertilizer at 73 kg N ha-1, with N applied granularly immediately before and 4 weeks after herbicide treatment. Results showed that combining flazasulfuron with two applications of N at 73 kg N ha-1 significantly improved annual bluegrass control compared to flazasulfuron alone, across all application rates and rating dates. Notably, the lowest flazasulfuron rate (4.4 g ha-1) with two N applications provided better control than the highest flazasulfuron rate (17.5 g ha-1) alone. Perennial ryegrass control was not significantly affected by N fertility. Laboratory studies on annual bluegrass revealed that N fertilizer at 73 kg N ha-1 increased 14C flazasulfuron translocation from treated leaves to other shoot tissues, potentially explaining the observed field results.",
