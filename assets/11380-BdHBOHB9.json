            "Value": "Chlorazine applied to soil under field conditions is reportedly decomposed by soil microorganisms over 40 days based upon the lack of inhibition in the growth of winter grains in non-sterile soil versus the inhibition observed in sterile-soil(1). The increase in phytotoxicity of chlorazine to seedling oats over several months can be explained by the microbial dealkylation of chlorazine to the more phytotoxic herbicides trietazine or simazine(2). It has been reported that s-triazines which are similar in structure to chlorazine can be utilized by certain soil microorganisms as a source of energy(3)."

Similar behavior has been shown for the methoxy & methylthio-s-triazines. It has been reported that the s-triazines affect the tricarboxylic acid cycle with activation of phospho-phenyl pyruvate-carboxylase causing the disappearance of sucrose & glyceric acid with the formation of aspartic & malic acids. /S-triazines/"

            "Value": "Based upon a water solubility of 22 ppm at 26 \u00b0C(3), a Koc of 797 has been estimated(4). Based upon this estimated Koc, chlorazine will be expected to exhibit low mobility in soil(5). Evidence has been reported that indicates that the basicity of s-triazine herbicides, such as simazine, is not the main factor governing adsorption to soil humic acids(1). Adsorption of chlorazine to clay materials has been observed to vary strongly with pH and electrolyte concn of the system(6). It has been predicted that >95% of the chlorazine applied to soil under field conditions will be adsorbed onto clay materials in the soil based upon experimental results for adsorption onto illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite(6). It has been shown that the ability of s-triazines herbicides to act as electron donors to electron acceptor quinone-like units of humic acids also plays an important role in the adsorption(2)."
