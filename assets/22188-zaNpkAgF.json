At an initial concentration of 2.88 ppm, 28% biodegradation was observed for radio-labeled terbacil (unspecified placement of the label) after 600 days in an aerobic sandy loam soil(2); in the same study, only a trace amount of the 2.88 ppm terbacil (unspecified placement of the label) biodegraded in an anaerobic sandy loam after 145 days(2). Furthermore, 2.1 ppm terbacil degraded <5% in anaerobic silt loam and sandy soil after 60 days at 20 \u00b0C in the dark(1). After 90 days of incubation in sterile and nonsterile soils, at least 90% of 2 ppm terbacil remained; 0.8-1.5% of applied 14C evolved as CO2 from nonsterile soil, whereas 0.01% was evolved from sterile soil(1).
