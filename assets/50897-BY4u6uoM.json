It is a carboxylic ester, an organofluorine compound, a member of pyridines and an aromatic ether.

Beauv. \u266f3 AGRRE] and tolerant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Foliar absorption was more rapid in soybeans with 75% of the recovered 14C absorbed 6 h after treatment compared to 36% in quackgrass. Translocation of the radiolabel occurred in both soybean and quackgrass with no significant difference between the species. Differential absorption and translocation did not contribute to the selectivity of fluazifop-butyl. Herbicidal activity was lower on quackgrass plants at the five- to six-leaf stage when compared to the two- to three-leaf stage. Greater quackgrass control was observed at 30 than at 20 C. Foliar absorption of 14C-fluazifop-butyl was significantly greater at 30 than at 20 C. Translocation of the radiolabel was greater in plants exposed to full light as compared to shade. Moisture stress significantly reduced quackgrass control with fluazifop-butyl.",

Young plants (three to four leaves) with a portion of the second, third, or fourth leaf covered were sprayed with a dose equivalent to 0.25 kg a.i. ha-1. Subsequent application of 14C-fluazifop-butyl to the unsprayed area resulted in plant death within 2 weeks. Uptake by leaf 3 was rapid, with less than 5% of the applied dose remaining on the leaf surface after 24 hours. The highest proportion of 14C-activity was retained in the treated portion of the leaf, and only 2% of the applied dose was translocated from leaf 3, with 0.76% accumulating in the apical meristem. Uptake by the younger leaf 4 was more rapid, and the pattern of translocation differed, with more 14C-activity accumulating in apical meristematic tissue. Between 6-30% of the applied dose was undetected, particularly when foliar uptake was slow. Artificial leaf surface experiments suggested that this undetected activity may have been due to the volatility of fluazifop-butyl or degradation to volatile products. 14C-activity extracted from treated leaves was identified as fluazifop-butyl, fluazifop acid, and polar conjugates. The major 14C-activity extracted from the apical meristem was fluazifop acid, with no fluazifop-butyl detected in this extract.",
