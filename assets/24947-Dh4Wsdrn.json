These proteins are known to be induced by the injection of heavy metals such as Cd. Previously, we developed the measurement of the MT mRNA expression by the RT-PCR method. In this study, to clarify the relation between Cd-induced MT-I mRNA expression and female sex hormones in liver, we investigated the influences of the ovariectomy and female sex hormones on hepatic MT-I mRNA expression after Cd injection, and also investigated the effects of aging on hepatic MT-I mRNA expression in mice after Cd injection. We analysed the MT-I mRNA expression by the RT-PCR method. Cd-induced MT-I mRNA expression in ovariectomized mice was more than that in sham-operated mice (9 weeks old). Both 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone reduced the Cd-induced MT-I mRNA expression in ovariectomized mice (9 weeks old). Moreover, the MT-I mRNA expression in male mice was more than that of females (9 weeks old). However, the sex difference in the gene expression was not found in younger (4 weeks old) or older (46 weeks old) mice. These results suggest that the expression of hepatic MT-I mRNA after Cd injection is influenced by female sex hormones."

Recent reports indicate that Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, participate in the manifestation of chemical-induced hepatotoxicity. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-a) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is a major product of Kupffer cells and mediates the hepatotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been speculated that cadmium also may exert its hepatotoxicity via the production of TNF-a by the Kupffer cells. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine whether mice deficient in TNF-a are resistant to CdCl2-induced hepatotoxicity. TNF-a-null (TNF-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were dosed ip with saline, LPS (0.1 mg/kg)/Gln (L-galactosamine, 700 mg/kg), or CdCl2 (2.2, 2.8, 3.4, and 3.9 mg Cd/kg). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activities were quantified to assess liver injury. Caspase-3 activity was quantified to assess hepatocellular apoptosis. LPS/Gln treatment increased ALT (17-fold) and SDH (21-fold) in WT mice. In contrast, LPS/Gln-treatment did not significantly increase ALT or SDH in TNF-KO mice. LPS/Gln-treatment caused a 7.8-fold increase in caspase-3 activity in WT mice but did not increase caspase-3 in TNF-KO mice. Cadmium caused a dose-dependent increase in liver injury in both WT and TNF-KO mice. However, the liver injury produced by Cd in the TNF-KO mice was not different from that in WT at any dose. No significant increase in caspase-3 activity was detected in any of the Cd-treated mice. These data indicate that, in contrast to LPS/Gln-induced hepatotoxicity, TNF-a does not appear to mediate Cd-induced hepatotoxicity."

Exposure of human cell lines, HCT15, PLC/PR/5, HeLa, and Chang, to cadmium chloride resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death, and this was associated with a significant decrease in eIF4E protein levels. Similarly, specific silencing of the expression of the eIF4E gene, caused by a small interfering RNA, resulted in significant cytotoxicity and cell death. On the other hand, overexpression of the eIF4E gene was protective against the cadmium-induced cytotoxicity and cell death. Further studies revealed the absence of alterations in the eIF4E mRNA level in the cadmium-treated cells despite their decreased eIF4E protein level. In addition, exposure of cells to cadmium resulted in enhanced ubiquitination of eIF4E protein while inhibitors of proteasome activity reversed the cadmium-induced decrease of eIF4E protein. Exposure of cells to cadmium, as well as the specific silencing of eIF4E gene, also resulted in decreased cellular levels of cyclin D1, a critical cell cycle and growth regulating gene, suggesting that the observed inhibition of cyclin D1 gene expression in the cadmium-treated cells is most likely due to decreased cellular level of eIF4E. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the exposure of cells to cadmium chloride resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death due to enhanced ubiquitination and consequent proteolysis of eIF4E protein, which in turn diminished cellular levels of critical genes such as cyclin D1."

The inhibition produced by cadmium chloride in heart mitochondria was compared, using identical procedures, to the effects induced by sodium atractyloside and potassium cyanide, which are known to alter mitochondrial respiration at specific sites. The calculated values for these agents in heart mitochondria were 1.8 and 16 uM, respectively. The concn dependent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration induced by either cadmium chloride or potassium cyanide was maintained in the presence of 50 uM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a known uncoupling agent. In addition cadmium chloride was also shown to inhibit carbonyl m-chlorophenylhydrazone uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. The cadmium induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was reversed partially by cysteine and completely by 2,3-dimercaptopropanol."

Although the major route of exposure to cadmium for most people is via food, causing the gastrointestinal tract to become the first target organ, very little information is available on whether cadmium exposure triggers the intestinal inflammatory response. We investigated in the present study the acute inflammatory response in the intestines of mice orally challenged with a single dose of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) by determining the gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators with real-time /polymerase chain reaction/, and by examining the infiltration of inflammatory cells with a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay and histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained intestinal sections. The results show that CdCl2 significantly increased the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 mRNA (30-40 times the normal level) 3 hr and the activity of MPO (about 2 times the normal level) 24 hr after the challenge in the duodenal and proximal jejunal tissue. Furthermore, these increases were dose-dependent over a dosage range of 25-100 mg/kg of body weight. The histological analysis confirmed that CdCl2 induced mild to moderate villus damage and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria. All these results demonstrate that oral exposure to CdCl2 triggered an acute inflammatory response in the proximal intestine of mice, suggesting that the gut immune system was involved in the toxic effects of Cd on the gastrointestinal tract."

Recent reports indicate that Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, participate in the manifestation of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive nitrogen radical produced by activated Kupffer cells via the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Nitric oxide can combine with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a molecule that may participate in the toxic mechanisms of hepatotoxins, such as acetaminophen and bacterial endotoxin. It has been speculated that Cd also may exert its hepatotoxicity, in part, via the production of NO by iNOS. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine whether iNOS contributes to Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Wild-type (WT) mice were administered selective iNOS inhibitors (AMT and 1400W) concurrently and 3 hr after administration of a hepatotoxic dose of Cd (4.0 mg Cd/mg). Additionally, WT and iNOS-null (iNOS-KO) mice were dosed iv with saline or 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0 mg Cd/kg.

Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, have been suggested to play a role in Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) may prevent Cd-induced hepatotoxicity by suppressing Kupffer cells. However, GdCl3 also induces the Cd-binding protein, metallothionein (MT). Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether GdCl3 prevents Cd-induced hepatotoxicity via the induction of MT. Hepatic MT and Kupffer cell counts were analyzed 24 hr after wild-type (WT) mice were administered saline or 10, 30, or 60 mg GdCl3/kg. GdCl3 induced MT in a dose-dependent manner without affecting nonprotein sulfhydryl content. All examined doses of GdCl3 were effective at eliminating Kupffer cells from the liver. To examine the hepatoprotective effects of GdCl3, WT and MT-null mice were pretreated with saline or 10, 30, or 60 mg GdCl3 24 hr prior to a hepatotoxic dose of Cd/Cl2/ (2.5 mg Cd/kg). Blood and livers were removed 16 hr later and analyzed for hepatotoxicity as well as MT, Cd, and Kupffer cell content. Hepatotoxicity was alleviated in both WT and MT-null mice that were pretreated with 30 or 60 mg GdCl3kg, indicating that MT induction is not required for the hepatoprotective effects of GdCl3. Hepatic Cd content was not decreased by GdCl3, demonstrating that GdCl3 does not negatively affect Cd distribution to the liver. Kupffer cells were depleted at all three doses of GdCl3, whereas hepatoprotection was only observed at doses of 30 and 60 mg GdCl3/kg. This does not rule out Kupffer cells in the mechanism of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity, but it does suggest that GdCl3 exerts hepatoprotective effects on the liver aside from depleting Kupffer cells. In summary, these data substantially rule out MT induction and decrease the importance of Kupffer cells as mechanisms of GdCl3-induced protection from Cd-induced hepatotoxicity."

Moreover, there is no straightforward relationship between ambient concentration levels, exposure (external dose) and the dose delivered to the target site (internal dose). Recently, a human and a rat airway PM deposition model (MPPDep V1.1) have been developed by CIIT Centers for Health Research and the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)... This paper describes studies using cadmium chloride (CdCl2) as a model for toxic aerosol particles to (1) investigate the role of particle size in the development of pulmonary effects, and (2) evaluate the MPPDep model, by comparing predicted deposition with measured deposition of CdCl2 in the respiratory tract. Rats (ten per group) were exposed for a single 4-hr period to CdCl2 particles at various sizes, i.e. 33, 170, 637 and 1495 nm, all at a target concentration of 1 mg/cu m. Immediately after exposure, four of ten rats per group were killed and trachea, lung lobes, heart, liver and kidneys were collected and preserved to determine the amount of CdCl2 present in each of these organs. CdCl2-induced toxicity, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was determined in the remaining six rats per group the day after exposure. Animals exposed to 33 nm particles showed the highest level of respiratory toxicity, followed by animals exposed to 637 nm particles, then to 170 nm particles and finally by those exposed to 1495 nm particles. Pulmonary cadmium levels showed a similar relationship. The results from the present study suggest that the induction of pulmonary toxicity following inhalation exposure to soluble CdCl2 particles in the range 30-1500 nm depends on the amount of deposited material, which in its turn depends on the initial (aerodynamic) particle size. In addition, the MPPDep model accurately predicted the measured CdCl2 deposition. Conclusively, for soluble particles the deposited pulmonary mass (dose) of particles is important for toxicity and is dependent of particle size..."

Both the compounds had similar retention of metal in lungs but CdO induced more pulmonary inflammatory and degradative changes than CdCl2. The larger influx of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) following CdO exposure appears to be due to the absence of protection afforded by Cd induced metallothionein cytoplasmic protein while the Cd metallothionein complex formed in the case of CdCl2 is more protective. However both forms of Cd had similar local immunosuppressive potential but CdO had more prolonged suppressive effect."

Lung lysyl-oxidase activity increased in both models, although less so with repeated exposures. Pulsing lung tissue in vitro with (3)H-proline indicated that the rates of collagen biosynthesis were elevated preferentially over rates of non-collagen protein synthesis in both exposure models. Lung metallothionein increased nearly linearly over 21 days of repeated exposure. Histologic examination revealed scarred lesions distorting alveolar structure and bronchioles in both models. ... Scarring and cell exudation into the airways and interstitium was less in the repeatedly exposed model. The results indicate the activation of a connective tissue repair reaction in both models. Increased levels of metallothionein after repeated exposure may both sequester cadmium and reduce pools of copper available for lysyl-oxidase synthesis, thus limiting the fibrotic response."

Exposure to 2.0 mg Cd/cu m resulted in rapid weight loss, and all of the animals died within the first 45 exposure days. As a group, female rats survived significantly longer than the males. Exposure to Cd resulted in dose dependent increases in lung weight. The increased weight was the result of additional tissue mass rather than edema. Both connective tissue components, elastin and collagen, were significantly increased in the 1.0 mg/cu m group when these components were expressed on the basis of dry weight. Dose-dependent changes at the terminal bronchioles consisted of hyperplasia and flattening of type II cells, inflammation, and the proliferation of fibroblasts.

Special emphasis was placed on analysis of cell proliferation following injury. Male Balb/c mice were exposed to aerosols of 4.9 micrograms Cd/liter for 1 hr while controls were exposed to water aerosols. Immediately after, half of each group was placed in 80% oxygen for 6 days, while the rest were left in room air. Three endpoints were used to assess lung injury; measurement of hydroxyproline, (14)C thymidine incorporation into DNA, and histopathology. Parenchymal and bronchiolar labeling indices were determined following autoradiography. A 1 hr exposure to CdCl2 aerosols caused marked cell proliferation in the lung with the peak of cell labeling occurring at day 5. In animals exposed to both CdCl2 + 80% oxygen, the cell labeling peak was delayed until day 9. Cell differentiation studies showed a delay in the peak of type II epithelial cell and endothelial cell division when CdCl2 exposure was followed by the 80% oxygen treatment. On Day 15 most of the labeled cells were identified as interstitial cells in both treated groups. Bronchiolar cell labeling was suppressed at the early time period in the Cd + oxygen group. With time, the histologically visible lung lesions tended to resolve in animals exposed to CdCl2 or CdCl2 and 80% oxygen, whereas total pulmonary hydroxyproline remained at all times (3, 6, and 12 months) significantly higher in Cd treated animals when compared to controls. It was concluded that acute lung injury by a toxic inhalant can be amplified if there is an initial delay in pulmonary cell proliferation following an acute insult."

In addition to the determination of cortical Cd levels and histopathological assessment of kidneys, labeling indices (LIs) for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the renal cortical tubular epithelium of Cd-treated rats were determined as a measure of regenerative activity. For comparison, the kidneys of rats given diets containing small to large amounts of CdCl2 up to 600 ppm for 4 months were similarly examined (experiment 2). Animals in experiment 1 demonstrated spontaneous chronic nephropathy and fluctuation in the tubular PCNA LI, but these findings were not correlated with renal Cd levels at 22 months. PCNA LI on the other hand, appeared to be linked to the severity of chronic nephropathy. In experiment 2, levels of CdCl2 of 200 ppm or more clearly induced degeneration and apoptosis of proximal tubules with high correlations between renal Cd levels, PCNA LI, and the severity of tubular degeneration. The results demonstrated that, in contrast to high-dose Cd administration, treatment with 40 ppm or less for 22 months did not influence tubular regeneration as a component of nonspecific chronic nephropathy, suggesting that long-term oral administration of low levels of Cd does not injure renal tubules in female rats."

A dose-dependent increase in urinary Cd levels became evident with time. Induction of metallothionein (MT) was also observed in the liver and kidney with a high correlation to the corresponding Cd levels. In the proximal renal tubular epithelia of 40 ppm CdCl2-treated rats at 22 months, prominent accumulation of Cd was observed in secondary lysosomes associated with MT deposits in their exocytotic residual bodies. The results demonstrated that, in contrast to the case with high-dose Cd-administration, renal toxicity is not induced by long-term oral administration of low amounts of Cd, although tissue accumulation does occur. Possible protective mechanisms may be operating."

The incidences of testicular tumors (mostly interstitial-cell tumors) were correlated with the extent of testicular degeneration induced by cadmium and showed a positive dose-dependence with single doses of cadmium: 83% at 40 umol/kg and 72% at 20 umol/kg, as compared with 18% in controls (p </= 0.05; Cochran-Armitage test). The 5 umol/kg and 20 umol/kg doses did not increase the incidence of testicular tumors. Prostatic tumor incidence was significantly elevated at the 2.5 umol/kg dose (8/26; 31 %; p </= 0.05, Fisher exact test) compared with controls (5/44; 11%), and a positive dose-effect relationship was seen between 0 and 2.5 umol/kg in both tumor incidence and multiplicity (p </= 0.05; Cochran-Armitage test). A reduction to the control level in the tumor response of the prostate to higher doses of cadmium (p </= 5.0 umol/kg) was attributed ... to testicular degeneration and consequent loss of androgenic support. Cadmium chloride suppressed the induction of tumors of the pancreas (both islet-cell and acinar-cell) from 60% in controls to 20% in animals receiving 40 umol/kg cadmium, with a negative dose dependence (p </= 0.05, Cochran-Aritage test)."

Rats received either no further treatment or treatment with calcium acetate or magnesium acetate, either in the diet (3%) two weeks prior and two weeks after cadmium chloride treatment or by three separate subcutaneous injections (calcium acetate, 0.16 mmol/kg bw (25.3 mg/kg bw); magnesium acetate, 4.0 mmol/kg bw (570 mg/kg bw)) in the same area as the cadmium chloride 24 hr before, at the same time as and 24 hr after cadmium chloride injection. Control rats received saline injections instead of cadmium chloride. All animals were examined histologically. The highest dose of cadmium chloride caused slight weight suppression but only up to 12 weeks after injection. Survival was not affected by any of the treatments. Tumors at the site of injection (predominantly fibrosarcomas) occurred to a similar extent (approximately 33% of rats at risk) in all groups receiving cadmium chloride, regardless of the dose or of other treatments, with the exception of injected magnesium acetate which significantly reduced (to 0; P < 0.02; X2) the response to cadmium at the injection site. Both levels of cadmium chloride increased the incidence of testicular interstitial-cell tumors (approximately 85%) over that in controls (30%); the increase was generally unchanged by other treatments, with the exception of dietary calcium acetate, which resulted in a lower incidence than in animals receiving cadmium chloride alone, but only at the high dose. When ail groups receiving cadmium chloride were considered together, a significantly (p < 0.02) higher incidence of pancreatic islet-cell tumors (mainly adenomas) occurred (22/258 rats; 8.5%) when compared with rats not receiving cadmium chloride (3/137; 2.2%). /Cadmium chloride hemipentahydrate/"

We have designed a co-culture system, in which HEEC were grown in the same cell culture medium as endometrial stromal cells but in separate, communicating chambers. With quantitative PCR, we investigated changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, sex steroids and endothelial cell specific functions. We found that cadmium altered the mRNA expression of the two important angiogenic molecules VEGF-A and PLGF.

Other factors such as specific cadmium anion involved and the duration of cadmium treatment period in the investigation also influenced the assessment results of cadmium-induced chromosome aberration. In the protocol with a 2 hr pulse treatment, cadmium acetate, chloride and sulfate induced more chromosome aberration than cadmium nitrate, carbonate and oxide. When cadmium was present in the culture of the entire treatment period for 18 hr, the results went the opposite way. Cadmium nitrate, carbonate and oxide induced significant chromosome aberration, while other three cadmium compounds gave negative results. Cadmium compounds did not induce significant SCE at the same dose level that yielded significant chromosome aberration induction, either in the protocol with the short pulse or long treatment period."

Two hr treatment with CdCl2 in HEPES-Hanks or continuous treatment for 24 hr in MEM + 10% FBS was respectively 2 or 3 times more cytotoxic than 2 hr treatment with the metal in MEM + 10% FBS. Continuous treatment for 24 hr with a CdCl2 concn in excess of 5x10-6 M was too toxic to the cells to allow chromosomal analysis, and moreover, only a slight increase in incidence of chromosomal aberrations was observed at a concn of 5x10-6 M CdCl2.

Two hr treatment with cadmium in HEPES-Hanks was approximately 3 times more potent for the induction of chromosomal aberrations than that in MEM + 10% FBS. Types of aberrations induced by CdCl2 mainly consisted of chromatid gaps and breaks, although a few exchanges, dicentrics and fragmentations were observed at high concentrations of cadmium. Increase in incidence of tetraploidy was also observed with a concn dependency after 2 hr treatment with CdCl2. Potency of CdCl2 to induce chromosomal aberrations after 2 hr exposure was comparable to that of benzo(a)pyrene activated with S9 at equitoxic concentrations. Two hr treatment with cadmium markedly inhibited incorporation of (3)H thymidine, even at concentrations at which incorporation of (3)H uridine or (3)H leucine was less inhibited. However, the inhibition of (3)H thymidine incorporation by cadmium was reversible and the incorporation restored to the control level during 2-6 hr of post-treatment incubation. These findings suggest that restoration of DNA synthesis after cadmium exposure is required for the efficient detection of chromosomal aberrations induced by the metal."

Among the Cl(-)-channel inhibitors the fenemates, flufenamic acid (FFA) and niflumic acid (NFA), and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) significantly lowered Cd(2+)-activated short current  compared with control level. In SPQ-loaded A6 cells, Cd(2+) evoked an increase in Cl(-) secretion, which significantly exceeded the basal Cl(-) transport and was blockable by FFA and NFA. The closely related metals, Zn(2+) or Ni(2+), were also able to activate Cl(-) secretion. Preexposure of Zn (2+) or Ni(2+) completely prevented Cd(2+) evoked increase in Cl(-) secretion, suggesting that Zn(2+) and Ni(2+) probably use similar mechanisms. Like Cd(2+), thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase and the Ca(2+)-ionophore A23187, induced an increase in the short current. Moreover, TG and Cd(2+) were able to neutralize the responses of the counterparts as also observed in short current measurements, which indicates that Cd(2+) activates Cl(-) secretion in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Hence, this study supports the idea that basolateral Cd(2+)(possibly also Zn(2+) and Ni(2+)), probably through a Ca(2+)-sensing receptor, causes calcium mobilization that activates apical fenemate-sensitive chloride channels leading to chloride secretion in A6 cells."

In the IEC-18 cells, Cd(2+) concentrations affecting the barrier (50 and 100 uM) also affected cell viability. In both cell lines the effects on the cell layers continued to develop after removal of extracellular Cd(2+). This correlated with the cellular retention of Cd(2+), which was high for the 12 hr following 4 hr accumulation.

THE IN VIVO ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST DINITROPHENYLAMINOETHYLACARBAMYLMETHYL- FICOLL, A T-LYMPHOCYTE INDEPENDENT, MACROPHAGE DEPENDENT RESPONSE, WAS ENHANCED BY CADMIUM. SIMILARLY, THE IN VIVO ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST ESCHERICHIA COLI 0127 (LPS), A T-LYMPHOCYTE AND MACROPHAGE INDEPENDENT RESPONSE, WAS ALSO ENHANCED BY CADMIUM. IN CONTRAST, THE IN VITRO ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST SHEEP RED BLOOD CELLS, A T-LYMPHOCYTE AND MACROPHAGE DEPENDENT RESPONSE, WAS SUPPRESSED IN SPLEEN CELL CULTURES THAT CONTAINED CADMIUM EXPOSED NON ADHERENT CELLS (LYMPHOCYTES). CULTURES CONTAINING CADMIUM EXPOSED ADHERENT CELLS (MACROPHAGES) WERE NOT SUPPRESSED BY CADMIUM."

            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ AEROSOL CADMIUM (CADMIUM CHLORIDE) EXPOSURE OF FEMALE C57B1/6 MICE WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF CADMIUM ON THE CELLULAR AND HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSES OF SPLENIC LYMPHOCYTES. PRIMARY CELLULAR AND HUMORAL RESPONSES OF LYMPHOCYTES WERE EXAMINTED AT 5-18 DAYS AFTER A SINGLE, 60 MIN EXPOSURE TO 0.88 MG CADMIUM/CU M (MMAD= 0.7 + OR - 0.3 UM, G= 3.43). SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF IN VITRO LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE RESPONSE TO ALLOGENEIC ANTIGENS, LPS AND PHA ANTIGENS, AND INHIBITION OF THE PRIMARY IGM RESPONSE TO SHEEP ERYTHROCYTES WERE CORRELATED WITH A MARKED DECREASE IN SPLEEN CELL VIABILITY AT 5-8 DAYS AFTER AEROSOL CADMIUM EXPOSURE. THIS TYPE OF CADMIUM INDUCED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION WHICH CORRELATED WITH THE DIRECT CYTOTOXICITY OF EFFECTOR CELLS, APPEARED TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CHRONIC, ORAL CADMIUM INDUCED SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIMARY IGM RESPONSE, IN WHICH ACUTE CYTOTOXICITY OF THE SPLEEN CELL POPULATION WAS NOT OBSERVED."

            "Value": "/IMMUNOTOXICITY/ Six week old BDF1 female mice were exposed to cadmium chloride in the drinking water at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 micrograms/mL cadmium for three weeks. The humoral immune response against sheep red blood cells which is T-lymphocyte and macrophage dependent, was suppressed in a dose dependent fashion with the maxiumum suppression of 28.2% observed in the highest exposure group (p < 0.0001). Mitogen studies demonstrated that cadmium was a weak mitogen, producing a dose-dependent enhancement of blastogenesis (p = 0.026). T-lymphocyte response which was induced by concanavalin A was not affected by cadmium exposure (p = 0.284). A dose dependent enhancement of the B-lymphocyte activity was produced in the presence of cadmium when the lymphocytes were induced with Escherichia coli, lipopolysaccharide, a B-lymphocyte mitogen (p = 0.007). These results suggest that the immunosuppressive effects of cadmium associated with the humoral immune response are not due to an impairment of lymphocyte proliferation, an intermediate step involved in the generation of an immune response. The immunosuppressive effects were produced at relatively low cadmium exposures as indicated by the renal cadmium concentrations suggesting that the immune systems is very vulnerable to the toxic effects of cadmium."
