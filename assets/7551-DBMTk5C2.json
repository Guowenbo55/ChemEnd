    "Description": "Barban is a carbamate ester that is 4-chlorobut-2-yn-1-yl ester of N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamic acid. A herbicide, it is no longer approved for use within the European Community. It has a role as a herbicide. It is a carbamate ester, an acetylenic compound and a member of monochlorobenzenes.",

Barban was degraded to 3-chloroaniline by a soil isolate of Penicillium sp. The barban-hydrolyzing enzyme was presumed to be an amidase(2). It was determined that the alkaline hydrolysis of barban leads to the degradation product 3-chloroaniline(3)."

            "Value": "The Koc of barban is estimated as 1,200(SRC), derived from its water solubility of 11 mg/L(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that barban is expected to have slight mobility in soil. Using TLC and aluminum oxide sorbent, the Rf value of barban was determined to be 0.5(4). The phenylcarbamate herbicides are much more water soluble than the substituted anilines(5). In spite of this, however, they are very immobile in soil systems. These compounds have been shown to be activated by adsorption to soil organic matter. Compounds in this group include barban. The mechanism of adsorption to soil organic matter is thought to involve hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl groups of the organic matter and the nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of the carbamate(5)."
