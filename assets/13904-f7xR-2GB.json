Terbutryn stimulated both phosphatases, whereas prometryn stimulated only the phosphodiesterase. Atrazine, desmetryn, prometon, and simazine inhibited acid phosphatase. No effect was exerted by ametryn. The enzyme assays and the kinetic parameters demonstrated that the interferences observed were due to an action on the synthesis of one or both enzymes rather than on the enzyme reaction. The types of the N-alkyl and the chlorine-substituent groups in the structures of the s-triazines tested appear important in determining the degree if the interference."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that desmetryne is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Evidence has been reported that indicates that the basicity of s-triazine herbicides, such as desmetryne, is not the main factor governing adsorption to soil humic acids(4). It has been shown that the ability of s-triazine herbicides to act as electron donors to electron acceptor quinone-like units of humic acids plays an important role in the adsorption(5)."

            "Value": "In the study examining factors affecting the systemic behavior of foliar-applied herbicides, including desmetryn, various operations were compared to enhance penetration and translocation. When plants were treated with desmetryn and exposed to light, fluorescent zones appeared irregular, with increased translocation observed, though photoinhibition-related effects might have influenced measurements. Abrading the epidermis improved translocation, and the addition of a surfactant (Tween 80) enhanced systemicity. These results highlighted the significance of cuticular penetration and external factors in determining desmetryn's systemic movement, while also noting the unique behavior of other herbicides like atrazine, where translocation appeared light-independent and linked to cuticular penetration."
