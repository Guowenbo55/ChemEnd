            "Value": "Dioxathion, which was marketed as Delnav R, was first used in combination with other acaricides to combat ticks, which transmit diseases and cause economic losses in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Dioxathion was widely applied by dipping or spraying cattle once or twice weekly at a 0.05% concentration to manage tick burdens. However, residue studies showed dioxathion could be detected in milk up to maximum levels of 2.25 ppm in the milk fat just 3 hours after treatment. Residues declined gradually but were still present at 1.27 ppm in milk fat at 45 hours post-application. As dioxathion is non-systemic, it acts where applied but does not translocate systemically through the animal. Further research into the nature and tolerance of dioxathion residues in milk is still needed to fully understand dietary risks. "
