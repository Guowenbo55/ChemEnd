    "Description": "Triclocarban is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea substituted by a 4-chlorophenyl group and a 3,4-dichlorophenyl group at positions 1 and 3 respectively. It has a role as a disinfectant, an antiseptic drug, an antimicrobial agent, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a dichlorobenzene, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a member of phenylureas. It is functionally related to a 1,3-diphenylurea.",
