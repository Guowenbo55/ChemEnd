            "Value": "The cardiovascular actions of anticholinesterase agents are complex, since they reflect both ganglionic and postganglionic effects of accumulated ACh on the heart and blood vessels. The predominant effect on the heart from the peripheral action of accumulated ACh is bradycardia, resulting in a fall in cardiac output. Higher doses usually cause a fall in blood pressure, often as a consequence of effects of anticholinesterase agents on the medullary vasomotor centers of the CNS. /Anticholinesterase agents/"

According to some, the difference is confined to young people. There is no sex difference in the red cell enzyme activity. Serum cholinesterase activity of blacks tends to be lower than whites of the same sex. /Organic phosphorus pesticides/"
