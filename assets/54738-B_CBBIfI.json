It is a member of pyridines, a member of imidazolines, an imidazolone and a pyridinemonocarboxylic acid.",

The results showed that alligatorweed absorbed more than twice as much imazapyr compared to glyphosate when applied to the leaves. Furthermore, imazapyr exhibited greater translocation to the underground storage tissues of alligatorweed compared to glyphosate. This disparity in translocation to roots and subterranean storage tissues is suggested as a potential mechanism for the tolerance of alligatorweed to glyphosate and its susceptibility to imazapyr.",

[14C]Pronamide was applied as a sunflower seed treatment by coating or soaking, affecting herbicide absorption but not the subsequent distribution within the plant. Translocation of [14C]pronamide from treated seed to the plant was greater for the coating treatment, with leaves containing the largest amount of herbicide. For [14C]glyphosate and [14C]imazapyr applied post-emergence to sunflower, translocation within the host plant did not differ between parasitized and non-parasitized plants, with most radioactivity remaining in the treated leaf. Translocation of [14C]glyphosate to O. cumana reached 5.5% at 3 days after treatment (DAT). [14C]Imazapyr was absorbed more by the treated leaf than [14C]glyphosate at 1 DAT, with higher levels accumulated by O. cumana. Metabolism of [14C]imazapyr showed a constant presence in the treated leaf but a higher proportion of the parent compound in O. cumana, suggesting its control by this herbicide.",
