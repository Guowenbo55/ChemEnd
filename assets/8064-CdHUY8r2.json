Accordingly, the present study investigates whether 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP; also termed fomepizole and Antizol), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (the enzyme involved in the first step of the conversion of 1,4-BD into GHB), and the gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor antagonist (2S)(+)-5,5-dimethyl-2-morpholineacetic acid (SCH 50911), provides protection against 1,4-BD-induced mortality in CD1 mice. Two sets of experiments were conducted with mortality as the outcome measure. In all experiments, mice were initially treated with a lethal dose of 1,4-BD (3 g/kg, intragastric [i.g.]). In the first set of experiments (dose-response curves), once mice had displayed clear signs of 1,4-BD intoxication, animals were randomly allocated in separate groups (n=10) and treated acutely with either 4-MP (vehicle, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) or SCH 50911 (vehicle, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg, i.p.). Mortality was recorded every hour for the first 9 hours and 12, 18, and 24 hours after 1,4-BD injection. In the second set of experiments (time course), mice were randomly allocated in separate groups (n=10). A single dose of either 4-MP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or SCH 50911 (150 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes after administration of 3 g/kg 1,4-BD (i.g.). Again, mortality was recorded every hour for the first 9 hours and 12, 18, and 24 hours after 1,4-BD injection. In the dose-response experiments, the acute administration of 4-MP and SCH 50911 exerted a dose-dependent resuscitative effect in mice acutely intoxicated by 3 g/kg 1,4-BD. Specifically, 30 and 100 mg/kg 4-MP and 150 mg/kg SCH 50911 protected all treated mice against 1,4-BD-induced mortality. Conversely, all mice treated with 4-MP- and SCH 50911-vehicle died. In the time-course experiments, protection induced by 30 mg/kg 4-MP was complete when administered up to 90 minutes after 1,4-BD injection. Vice versa, the complete protection induced by 150 mg/kg SCH 50911 progressively diminished as the time between 1,4-BD and SCH 50911 administration was increased from 15 to 120 minutes. ..."

The ability of acute and chronic administration of equimolar doses of GHB (200 mg/kg), 1,4-BD (174 mg/kg) and GBL (166 mg/kg) to produce catalepsy in male Swiss Webster mice was examined. GHB, 1,4-BD, GBL produced catalepsy when injected acutely. Drug treatment was then continued for 14 days. Tolerance development was determined on days 6, 14, and challenged with a higher dose on day 15 in those chronically pretreated mice, and compared with naive mice. Chronic GHB produced tolerance to catalepsy, as evidenced from area under the curve (AUC) of catalepsy versus time (min-sec) on days 6 (678 +/- 254), 14 (272 +/- 247), which were less than those on day 1 (1923 +/- 269). However, less tolerance was seen from GBL or 1,4-BD, as AUCs on days 6 and 14 were not significantly lower than that of day 1. In conclusion, although equimolar doses were used, expecting similar levels of GHB in the body, 1,4-BD and GBL shared only some of the in vivo effects of GHB. The rate of metabolic conversion of 1,4-BD and GBL into GHB might be responsible for the differences in the tolerance development to these drugs."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring compound in the central nervous system (CNS) whose tissue concentration are highly increased in the neurometabolic-inherited deficiency of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) activity or due to intoxication. SSADH deficiency is biochemically characterized by increased concentrations of GHB in tissues, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine of affected patients. Clinical manifestations are variable and include retardation of mental, motor, and language development along with other neurological symptoms, such as hypotonia, ataxia and seizures, whose underlying mechanisms are practically unknown. The precursor of GHB, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) has been used to study the mechanisms of in vivo GHB neurotoxicity. Therefore, in the present work, the effect of acute administration of 20 or 120 mg/kg 1,4-BD was investigated on various parameters of oxidative stress, such as spontaneous chemiluminescence, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS), total antioxidant reactivity (TAR), sulfhydryl and protein carbonyl contents, as well as the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in homogenates from cerebral cortex of 14-day-old Wistar rats. Acute administration of 120 mg/kg 1,4-BD significantly increased spontaneous chemiluminescence and TBA-RS levels, while TAR measurement was markedly diminished, whereas injection of a lower dose (20 mg/kg) did not change the parameters examined. Other parameters of oxidative stress evaluated were not affected by administration of 1,4-BD. These results indicate that 1,4-BD induces in vivo oxidative stress by stimulating lipid peroxidation and decreasing the non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in cerebral cortex of young rats. If these effects also occur in humans, it is possible that they might contribute to the brain damage found in SSADH-deficient patients and possibly in individuals intoxicated by GHB or its prodrugs (gamma-butyrolactone or 1,4-BD)."

            "Value": "/BEHAVIORAL STUDIES/ Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) are prodrugs for gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Like GHB, GBL and 1,4-BD are drugs of abuse, but their behavioral effects may differ from GHB under some conditions. The first study compared the behavioral effects of GBL (32-240 mg/kg) and 1,4-BD (32-240 mg/kg) with each other and to effects previously reported for GHB (32-420 mg/kg). A second study determined GHB pharmacokinetics following intragastric administration of GHB, GBL, and 1,4-BD. Operant responding for food, observed behavioral effects, and a fine-motor task occurred at multiple time intervals after administration of drug or vehicle. In a separate pharmacokinetics study, blood samples were collected across multiple time points after administration of GHB, GBL, and 1,4-BD. Like GHB, GBL, and 1,4-BD impaired performance on the fine-motor task, but the onset of motor impairment differed across drugs. GBL and 1,4-BD dose dependently decreased the number of food pellets earned, but at lower doses than previously observed for GHB. Similar to GHB, both GBL and 1,4-BD produced sedation, muscle relaxation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tremors/jerks. Administration of GBL and 1,4-BD produced higher maximum concentrations of GHB with shorter times to maximum concentrations of GHB in plasma when compared to GHB administration. GBL and 1,4-BD produced behavioral effects similar to those previously reported with GHB and the time course of effects were related to blood levels of GHB. Given their higher potency and faster onset of effects, the abuse liability of GBL and 1,4-BD may be greater than GHB."

Given the reports of abuse, and the ease at which GBL and 1,4-BD may be obtained, we investigated the reinforcing effects of GBL (n=5) and 1,4-BD (n=4) in baboons using IV self-administration procedures. Sessions ran 24 hr/day. Each injection was contingent upon completion of a fixed number (120 or 160) of lever responses. A 3-hr timeout period followed each injection, limiting the total number of injections to eight per day. Self-administration was first established with cocaine (0.32 mg/kg/injection). GBL (10-130.0 mg/kg/injection), 1,4-BD (10-100 mg/kg/injection), or vehicle was substituted for cocaine for at least 15 days. Food pellets were available ad libitum 24 hr/day and were contingent upon completion of ten lever responses. GBL (32-100 mg/kg/injection) maintained significantly greater numbers of injections when compared to vehicle in four of five baboons, and the mean rates of injection were high (more than six per day) in three baboons and moderate in the fourth baboon (four to six per day). 1,4-BD (78-130 mg/kg/injection) maintained significantly greater numbers of injections when compared to vehicle in only two out of four baboons, and mean rates were moderate to high in both baboons. Self-injection of these doses of GBL and 1,4-BD generally inhibited food-maintained responding. GBL and 1,4-BD have abuse liability. Given that GBL and 1,4-BD are self-administered, are easier to obtain than GHB, and are detected in seized samples, additional legal control measures of these GHB pro-drugs may be needed."

Although there are case reports of a withdrawal syndrome following 1,4-BD use, no studies have evaluated the physical dependence potential of 1,4-BD and characterized the time course of withdrawal. Vehicle and then 1,4-BD were administered continuously 24 hr/day via intragastric catheters in male baboons (Papio anubis, n=3). Dosing was initiated at 100 mg/kg and increased by 100mg/kg/day to 400 mg/kg/day. After a stabilization period, doses of 500 and then 600 mg/kg/day were each maintained for 3-4 weeks. Plasma levels of 1,4-BD and GHB were determined for each dose condition. Physical dependence was assessed via administration of a GABA-B antagonist (precipitated withdrawal test) during administration of the 600 mg/kg/day dose and via abrupt termination of chronic 1,4-BD administration (spontaneous withdrawal test). Outcome measures included the number of food pellets earned, performance on a fine-motor task, observed behaviors, and plasma levels of GHB and 1,4-BD. Following maintenance of 1,4-BD 600 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, the number of food pellets earned was significantly decreased. At the end of chronic 1,4-BD dosing, the levels of GHB in plasma ranged from 1290 to 2300 umol/L and levels of 1,4-BD in plasma ranged from 13.1 to 37.9 umol/L. Signs of physical dependence were observed following precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal tests. Seizures were not observed. These data indicate chronic 1,4-BD produced physical dependence in baboons and the withdrawal syndrome can be characterized as mild to intermediate."
