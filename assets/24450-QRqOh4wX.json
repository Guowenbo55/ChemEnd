            "Value": "Once phosphate gains access to the body fluids and tissues, it exerts little pharmacological effect. If the ion is introduced into the intestine, the absorbed phosphate is rapidly excreted. If large amounts are given by this route, much of it may escape absorption. Because this property leads to a cathartic action, phosphate salts are employed as mild laxatives. Inorganic phosphate poisoning following ingestion of laxatives that contain phosphate salts has been reported in adults and children. Ingestion of large amounts of sodium dihydrogen phosphate lowers urinary pH. If excessive phosphate salts are introduced intravenously or orally, they may prove toxic by reducing the concentration of Ca 2+ in the circulation and from the precipitation of calcium phosphate in soft tissues. /Phosphates/"
