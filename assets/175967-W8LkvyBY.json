    "Description": "Mesotrione is an aromatic ketone that is cyclohexa-1,3-dione in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 4-(methanesulfonyl)-2-nitrobenzoyl group. It has a role as a herbicide, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a sulfone, a C-nitro compound, an aromatic ketone and a beta-triketone. It is functionally related to a benzophenone.",

            "content": "Studies were conducted under controlled growth conditions to determine whether differential absorption, translocation, or metabolism was the basis for the differential response of grain sorghum hybrids to mesotrione. Mesotrione-tolerant ('Dekalb DKS35-70') and mesotrione-susceptible ('Pioneer 84G62') grain sorghum hybrids were treated with 14C-labeled mesotrione. At 1 d after treatment (DAT), absorption was 7% in both hybrids; at 7 DAT, however, absorption remained nearly steady in Pioneer 84G62 but increased to 12% in Dekalb DKS35-70. Translocation of 14C-mesotrione in sorghum hybrids was similar with less than 30% of the absorbed herbicide translocated out of the treated leaf by 7 DAT. A distinct metabolite of 14C-mesotrione was separated in both hybrids at 3 DAT. The amount of mesotrione parent compound that remained in Pioneer 84G62 and DKS35-70 was 72 and 65%, respectively. Dekalb DKS35-70 had significantly less mesotrione at 3 DAT than Pioneer 84G62 did, but the amount of mesotrione was similar for both hybrids at 5 and 7 DAT. Rapid metabolism of mesotrione may help explain the differential response of grain sorghum hybrids.",

Absorption of 14C-atrazine alone (62.5%) and as a mixture (60%) in morning glory was higher than in the treatments with 14C-mesotrione alone (42.8%) and as a mixture (46.6%). However, 14C-mesotrione alone showed a higher translocation (8.6%) than 14C-mesotrione\u2009+\u2009atrazine (2.5%), indicating that the mixture decreased the translocation of this herbicide.",
