It exhibited the longest duration of effectiveness against pests, with Lt50 values indicating its prolonged presence on castor bean (14.91 days) and cotton (9.93 days) plants. Despite its persistence, pyridalyl didn't exhibit significant systemic activity against the 4th instar larvae of S. littoralis in either cotton or castor bean plants. Instead, it demonstrated strong local activity, proving highly effective when the larvae fed on treated cotton plants. Similarly, when larvae fed on treated castor bean plants, pyridalyl resulted in superior larval mortality rates. This suggests that while pyridalyl had substantial residue persistence, its systemic movement within these plants was limited. The study revealed that the type of host plant significantly impacted the toxicological behavior of the insecticide, highlighting the crucial role of the treated plant in influencing the efficacy and behavior of pesticides.",
