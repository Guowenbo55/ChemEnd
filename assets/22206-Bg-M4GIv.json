It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a diamino-1,3,5-triazine and a chloro-1,3,5-triazine. It is functionally related to a 6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.",

Attempts were made to predict measured uptake on the basis of mass flow theory given also measurements of transpiration rates, water, rooting, and herbicide distribution profiles in the soil, and soil adsorption characteristics."

Residues of all tested chemicals were detected in roots and shoots, but the uptake pathways varied. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) showed no translocation between roots and shoots. The s-triazine terbuthylazine was predominantly taken up by the roots and translocated to the shoots. Herbicides chlorotoluron and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were transported bidirectionally. The uptake of trichloroethylene (TCE), chlorobenzene, and methyl-t-butylether (MTBE) was primarily through foliar uptake.",
