    "Description": "Ethirimol is an aminopyrimidine that is 2-ethylaminopyrimidin-4-one carrying butyl and methyl substituents at positions 5 and 6 respectively. A fungicide first marketed in 1970 and used as a seed treatment for diseaases such as damping-off, it is not licensed for use within the European Union. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is an aminopyrimidine, a pyrimidone, a secondary amino compound and a pyrimidine fungicide.",

The relationships between uptake and transpiration rate were discussed in the light of the physico-chemical properties of these compounds, notably their partition coefficients in oil/water systems and their dissociation constants. Apart from 2,4-D, sorption of these compounds appears to be a passive process. At pH 4, the uptake of 2,4-D seems to be influenced by metabolism; not only may the concentration of this compound in the transpiration stream be considerably greater than that in the medium surrounding the roots, but absorption by roots is markedly reduced at low temperatures and by sodium azide. The initial rate of uptake of these compounds correlates reasonably well with their partition coefficients in olive oil/water or ra-dodecane/water systems; likewise, the concentration in the transpiration stream is greater for lipophilic than for lipophobic substances. The hydrogen ion and calcium concentrations of the ambient medium appear to have no effect on the uptake of compounds with low pK's, but the uptake of those substances which protonate between pH 4 and pH 6 is affected by them. These findings are discussed from the viewpoint that the pathways of transport of lipophilic and lipophobic compounds across the roots may differ.",
