Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate in the blood plasma of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) collected from the midwestern United States ranged from 13 to  2,220 ng/mL (mean: 330 ng/mL); concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate were greater in blood plasma than in whole blood. Among 82 livers from various species of birds from inland or coastal U.S. locations, Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) from San Diego, CA, contained the greatest concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonate (1,780 ng/g, wet wt). Perfluorooctane sulfonate was also found in the sera of albatrosses from the central North Pacific Ocean at concentrations ranging from 3 to 34 ng/mL. Occurrence of perfluorooctane sulfonate in birds from remote marine locations suggests widespread distribution of perfluorooctane sulfonate and related fluorochemicals in the environment. Data were collected over 1991 to 1998(1)."

            "Value": "SEDIMENT: Perfluoroctane sulfonic acid concentration in sediments collected in April 2008 from the Daliao River system of northeast China ranged from below the detection limit of 0.12 to 0.37 ng/g dry weight. The watershed is situated in a heavily populated and industrialized region(1). Median concentrations in river sediments collected in March 2009 from 13 sites in the Zhujiang River, Guangzhou and 9 sites in the Hunagpu River, Shanghai (China) were 0.58 and 0.11 ng/g dry weight, respectively(2). Median concentrations in river sediments collected in March 2009 from 13 sites in the Zhujiang River, Guangzhou and 9 sites in the Hunagpu River, Shanghai (China) were 0.21 and 0.43 ng/g dry weight, respectively(2). Concentrations in Japanese river sediments from the Kyoto region sampled in February 2005 were reported as follows (ng/g dry weight; detection limit = 0.8): Kamo River <1.9; Uji River Station 1: <0.33; Uji River Station 2: <1.4; Tenjin River 11; Katsura River <2.2; Osaka River Stations 1, 2, 3, and 4: <1.0, 3.8, 6.4, and <1.7, respectively(3). Perfluoroctane sulfonic acid was detected in 100% of sediment samples collected near the 3M Cottage Grove Facility, Minnesota at concentrations of 40.0-65,450 ng/g(4). It was detected in 80-82% of Mississippi River sediments at maximum levels of 3.16-79.0 ng/g(4). Perfluoroctane sulfonic acid was detected in 5 of 40 sediment sampling locations from the Puget Sound in 2010 at a concentration range of 0.18-0.23 ng/g dry wt(5). Sediments taken from Taihu Lake, East China contained levels of 0.13-6.95 ng/g dry wt(6)."
