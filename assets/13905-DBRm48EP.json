Their difference in electron transport inhibition during photosynthesis was identified as a factor influencing their phytotoxic effects, which varied between plant species. While barnyardgrass and the rice cultivar Choseng Tongil showed little difference in growth response between simetryn and dimethametryn, the Nihonbare rice cultivar exhibited greater tolerance to simetryn but relatively low tolerance to dimethametryn. In an experiment, two rice cultivars, Nihonbare and Choseng Tongil, and barnyardgrass were exposed to simetryn or dimethametryn at a concentration of 10-5M, chosen based on previous observations of differential phytotoxicity. The absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-labeled simetryn and dimethametryn were compared to elucidate the mechanism underlying the herbicides' differential phytotoxic activity.",

Different rice varieties, including the Japanese type ('Nipponbare' and 'Bluebell'), the Indian type ('IR-8' and 'CH-45'), and their hybrid varieties ('Shinsen' and 'T\u014ditsu'), were tested. It was found that the Japanese rice varieties showed resistance to simetryne, while the Indian type and many hybrid varieties were susceptible. However, under high-temperature conditions, even the Japanese rice varieties exhibited phytotoxicity, suggesting a complex mechanism. The study assessed the impact of temperature on the degree of phytotoxicity of simetryne in both resistant and susceptible varieties. The results showed that while the resistant variety ('Nipponbare') exhibited significant growth inhibition at high concentrations, recovery from phytotoxicity was observed even at low concentrations. The high-temperature conditions induced stronger and faster phytotoxic effects compared to low-temperature conditions in both resistant and susceptible varieties. Additionally, the study examined the absorption and translocation of simetryne in different rice varieties, revealing variations in absorption rates among varieties and higher absorption at higher temperatures. Overall, the study demonstrated that different rice varieties exhibit varying responses to simetryne based on their physiological characteristics, with Japanese varieties showing higher sensitivity to temperature changes, leading to rapid increases in internal concentration and subsequent phytotoxicity.",
