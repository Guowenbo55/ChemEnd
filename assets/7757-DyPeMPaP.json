No clinical signs observed were considered to be as a result of treatment with the test substance. There were no notable intergroup body weight, food or water consumption differences in either sex. There were no effects noted in hematology, clinical chemistries or urinalyses considered to be toxicologically significant in either sex. There were no intergroup differences in either organ weights, necropsy or histological findings that were considered to be treatment related in either sex. On completion of 4 weeks of dosing all main study animals were sacrificed and necropsied and given a detailed post mortem examination with organs being weighed ( i.e. adrenals, brain, kidney, liver, ovaries and testis with epididymis) and tissues preserved in fixative (i.e. all abnormal tissue, adrenals, brain, ears, eyes, heart, kidney, liver, lung, marrow smear, optic nerve, ovaries, pituitary, spleen stomach, testis with epididymis, thyroid with parathyroid and urinary bladder). Histological examination was carried out on all control and high dose animals. After the 2 week recovery period all recovery study animals were sacrificed and processed in an identical manner."
