    "Description": "Decamethonium is a quaternary ammonium ion that is a depolarising muscle relaxant whose structure comprises a decane-1,10-diamine core in which each amino group carries three methyl substituents. It has a role as a muscle relaxant and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. It derives from a hydride of a decane.",
