    "Description": "Diflufenican is a pyridinecarboxamide that is pyridine-3-carboxamide substituted by a 2,4-difluorophenyl group at the carbamoyl nitrogen and a 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy group at position 2. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a herbicide and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is an aromatic ether, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a pyridinecarboxamide.",

It is less efficient when applied post-emergence, with activity depending on the dose reaching the apical meristems. Contact with diflufenican has no significant effect on other parts of the plant, and translocation is negligible. In the absence of surfactants, the uptake of diflufenican is minimal and complete approximately 2 hours after treatment. Surfactant incorporation increases the time over which uptake occurs, with efficiency depending on surfactant type and lipophilicity. \"Silwet L-77\" (1.09 liter-1) was the only surfactant tested that caused sufficient damage to the apex to prevent subsequent recovery of the plant. The effect of nonylphenol ethoxylate surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (approximately 1.0 g liter-1) appeared to be partly attributable to leaf damage caused by the surfactant, possibly facilitating uptake. Increasing leaf coverage by surfactants did not necessarily improve uptake and activity.",
