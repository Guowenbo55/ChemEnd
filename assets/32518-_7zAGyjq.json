            "content": "Morpholine fungicides, despite being lipophilic, exhibit systemic properties in plants, likely due to their protonation at the pH of plant compartments, which yields a more polar cation form. This characteristic could be advantageous and may be applicable to other lipophilic pesticides. In a study with barley, uptake and transport of 14C-labelled dodemorph and tridemorph, two morpholine fungicides, were investigated using bathing solutions of varying pH. Uptake and transport were minimal at pH 5 but increased significantly at pH 8. Tridemorph, being more lipophilic, accumulated more in roots at pH 8 and was moderately translocated to shoots. Dodemorph, on the other hand, was highly efficient in translocating to shoots at pH 8, moving into the xylem across the endodermis at 23 times the efficiency of water, despite lower accumulation in roots compared to tridemorph. The study suggests that uptake and translocation of these fungicides are equilibrium processes maintained over time and can be explained by their partitioning and accumulation in acidic plant compartments through ion trapping as the protonated form, highlighting the importance of pKa and lipophilicity in their behavior.",
