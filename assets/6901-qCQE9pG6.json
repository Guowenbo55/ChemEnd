Estimated half-lives for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene disappearance based on monitoring data are 3-30 days in river water and 30-300 days in lake and ground waters(2). ANAEROBIC: Greater than 99% of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene transformed to (E,E)-1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobutadiene by reductive dechlorination in columns with Rhine sediment (Germany) operated at 20 \u00b0C with methanogenic electron acceptors(3). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was only removed under methanogenic conditions using these sediments and not when oxygen or nitrate were present in the column experiments(4). Reductive dechlorination in the column was ascribed to the activity of anaerobic microorganisms(4)."

Crayfish from a ditch near Baton Rouge, LA contained 70.1 ppb hexachloro-1,3-butadiene(1). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was found, but not quantified, in fish from the Ashtabula River, Ohio(2) and the Wabash River, Indiana(3). Mean hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concn in Lake Ontario rainbow trout was 0.2 ng/g(4). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene has also been detected in fish from Lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior(5). A study of 9 Great Lakes harbors and tributaries in Ohio and Wisconsin, between 1980 and 1981, found no hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in composite fish samples(6). A study of the distribution of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers using clams (E. complanatus) suspended in cages, found that none of the sites in the Detroit R. and 55% of the sites in the St. Clair River contained levels of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene above the detection limit, 1 ppb, wet wt(7). The highest mean concn was 83 ppb and results indicated that sources of pollutants were present in the Sarnia area(7). Residues of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene were found in 10 samples from fish collected from within 25 miles (40 km) of tetrachloroethylene or trichloroethylene production plant sites, at levels ranging from 0.01 to 1.2 mg/kg(8) In a United Kingdom study, various organs of 15 species of fish contained hexachloro-1,3-butadiene residues ranging from 0 to 2.6 ug/kg(8)."
