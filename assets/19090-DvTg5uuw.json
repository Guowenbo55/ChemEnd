    "Description": "Megestrol is a 3-oxo Delta(4)-steroid that is pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione substituted by a methyl group at position 6 and a hydroxy group at position 17. It has a role as a contraceptive drug, an antineoplastic agent, an appetite enhancer, a progestin and a synthetic oral contraceptive. It is a 20-oxo steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.",

            "Value": "Megestrol acetate shares the actions of the progestins: induction of secretory changes in the endometrium, increase in basal body temperature, pituitary inhibition, and production of withdrawal bleeding in the presence of estrogen. In animals, the drug suppresses ovulation and produces antigonadotrophic, antiuterotrophic and antiandrogenic/antimyotrophic effects. It has slight glucocorticoid activity and a very slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity. Megestrol acetate has no estrogenic, androgenic, or anabolic activity."

            "Value": "While the precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is unknown at the present time, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be factors. There is evidence to suggest a local effect as a result of the marked changes brought about by the direct instillation of progestational agents into the endometrial cavity. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is effected by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with cytoplasmic receptor and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but also are capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. It has been suggested that progestins may inhibit in one of two ways: by interfering with either the stability, availability, or turnover of the estrogen receptor complex in its interaction with genes or in conjunction with the progestin receptor complex, by interacting directly with the genome to turn off specific estrogen-responsive genes."

            "Value": "The precise mechanism for megestrol-induced weight gain has not been clearly established; however, evidence from clinical studies indicates that the increase in body weight observed during megestrol therapy is related to the drug's appetite-stimulant or metabolic effects rather than its glucocorticoid-like effects or the production of edema. It has been suggested that megestrol and/or its metabolites may, either directly or indirectly, stimulate appetite resulting in weight gain or may alter metabolic pathways via interference with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin (a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes)."

            "Value": "Splenic macrophage Fc gamma receptors participate in the pathophysiology of immune cytopenias, and in such disorders, the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids are in part mediated by decreased expression of macrophage Fc gamma receptors. In the animal model, progesterones, like glucocorticoids, inhibit expression of these receptors. Megestrol acetate (MA) is a progesterone frequently used for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated anorexia-cachexia. Twenty-eight patients with HIV-associated thrombocytopenia with shortened platelet survival and increased platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) who were being treated with MA for anorexia-cachexia were prospectively studied for a 6-month period to assess the potential role of progesterones in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Treatment with MA for non-consecutive periods of 2 months and 1 month significantly increased platelet count and platelet survival without significant alteration of platelet-associated immunoglobulin levels. Of the 28 patients studied, 22 presented a complete response, 19 presented a complete response 1 month after finishing the MA treatment regimen, and 12 remained in complete response for a further month. Expression of Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII) by peripheral blood monocytes and the in vitro recognition of IgG-sensitized cells by monocytes were significantly decreased by the MA treatment. Decreased expression and functioning of these receptors significantly correlated with platelet counts and survival times, but no relationship was found with platelet-associated immunoglobulin, circulating immune complexes, body mass index, plasma HIV load, or CD4 lymphocyte levels. These results suggest that treatment with progesterones, like MA, may be an alternative therapy for immune cytopenias, with few side effects."

            "Value": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally considered as a sex hormone-dependent tumor, and hormonal therapy has been proposed as a strategy for the treatment of HCC. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of megestrol acetate, a synthetic progesteronal agent, on growth of HepG2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Cell growth in vitro was assessed by a colormetric method, and cell growth in vivo was assessed by tumor volumetrics. Megestrol acetate was shown to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in vitro in dose- and time-dependent manners with an IC (50) of 260 um (24-hr incubation). The growth of HepG2 cell-transplanted tumors in nude mice was also inhibited by ip injection of megestrol acetate (10 mg/kg/day). The tumor volumes of the megestrol acetate-treated group regressed to 59% of controls by week 6 and to 41% of controls by week 13. Apoptosis following G(1) arrest was observed in megestrol acetate-treated cells and may be a mechanism through which megestrol acetate inhibits HepG2 cells. Megestrol acetate was also demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on the weight gain of tumor-bearing nude mice, and the mean weight of the megestrol acetate-treated animals was higher than that of controls from week 4 of the treatment period, and the differences were statistically significant in week 5 and 6 (P < 0.05, compared with controls). No significant survival advantage was, however, demonstrated in the treatment group. This study showed that megestrol acetate inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells grown in vitro and in vivo. These data provide useful information for clinical study of megestrol acetate for the treatment of HCC."

            "Value": "... Progestin diffuse freely into the cell nucleus, where they bind to the progesterone receptor and ultimately influence the transcription of a limited set of genes ... The antiestrogenic action of progestin is mediated in part by the induction of 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (which catalyzes the oxidation of estradiol to the less potent estrone) and estrogen sulfotransferase (which catalyzes the sulfation and inactivation of estrogens); expression of estrogen receptors is also repressed. /Progestins/"
