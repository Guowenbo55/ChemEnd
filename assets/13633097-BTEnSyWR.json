    "Description": "Dimethenamid-P is the (S)-enantiomer of 2-chloro-N-(2,4-dimethylthiophen-3-yl)-N-[(2S)-1-methoxypropan-2-yl]acetamide. It is the active enantiomer of dimethenamid, a herbicide applied to the soil to control various broad-leaved weeds and grasses. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and an antimitotic. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-dimethenamid.",

A research mentions that the primary site of absorption for dimethenamid-P in sugarbeet is through the roots, but some absorption also occurs through the hypocotyl. Additionally, the research discusses the movement of 14C-dimethenamid-P within the plant, indicating that it is translocated from the roots to the shoots. The slower metabolism and reduced translocation of dimethenamid-P in sugarbeet plants contributed to the greater susceptibility of sugarbeets to this herbicide compared to s-metolachlor.[Bollman, S. L., Sprague, C. L., & Penner, D. (2008). Physiological Basis for Tolerance of Sugarbeet Varieties tos-Metolachlor and Dimethenamid-P. Weed Science, 56(1), 18\u201325. doi:10.1614/ws-07-100.1\u00a0]",
            "reference": "Greenhouse and laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the tolerance of four commercial sugarbeet varieties to s-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P, determine the main site of herbicide absorption, and understand the physiological basis for differential tolerance among varieties. The study found that 'Beta 5833R' was the most tolerant variety, while 'Hilleshog 7172RZ' was the most susceptible to injury from these herbicides. Absorption of s-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P primarily occurred through the sugarbeet roots, with some absorption through the hypocotyl. Injury from dimethenamid-P was greater than from s-metolachlor in soil-grown sugarbeet, but similar in hydroponically grown sugarbeet, suggesting that soil availability influenced herbicide injury. Reduced translocation and slower metabolism of 14C-dimethenamid-P in both roots and shoots likely contributed to sugarbeet's greater susceptibility to dimethenamid-P compared to s-metolachlor. The more susceptible sugarbeet varieties showed 0.7 to 2.1 h slower metabolism of 14C-herbicides in shoots compared to the more tolerant variety, Beta 5833R, which was a significant factor in the differences in variety tolerance to both herbicides.",
