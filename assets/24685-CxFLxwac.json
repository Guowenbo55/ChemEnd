It is a selective herbicide used for the control of annual grasses and some broad-leaf weeds and is also a growth regulator for control of sprouting in stored potatoes. It has a role as a herbicide and a plant growth retardant. It is a carbamate ester and a member of benzenes.",

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Lima silt loam (7.7% organic matter; pH 7.2) that was never treated with pesticide was treated with 1 ml of distilled water containing 14C labeled isopropyl phenylcarbamate(1). The final concentration of labeled and unlabeled pesticide was between 50,000-60,000 dpm. C14C labeled carbon dioxide was trapped and analyzed(1). Within 60 days, 20% of the C14 was mineralized to carbon dioxide. When the soil was retreated with isopropyl phenylcarbamate about 70% was mineralized to carbon dioxide within 60 days. This shows that biodegradation may be an important fate process especially in soil that has repeated treatments of isopropyl phenylcarbamate(1). Similar results were obtained in a separate study where a different carbamate pesticide was used(2). After 14 days less than 10% of isopropyl phenylcarbamate remained in soil(pH5.8 6% silt and 8% clay) that had previously been treated with the pesticide carbetamide(2). Similar soil that had never been treated with any pesticide contained greater than 70% of the original isopropyl phenyl carbamate pesticide after 14 days(2). This shows that biodegradation of isopropylphenyl carbamate is likely to be dependent on the history of pesticide application on the soil."

At concentrations of 400 pg/ml and 10 ng/ml less than 30% of the substrate remained after 60 days. However at 1 ug/mL there was little or no loss of labeled isopropyl phenyl carbamate(1). This indicates that biodegradation in water may be dependent on the concentration of isopropyl phenylcarbamate. Isopropyl phenylcarbamate was incubated with water samples taken from the Nile River in Egypt in concentrations of 6-7 mg/L(2). No degradation was observed during 4 months of observation; however, biodegradation occurred within a few days after Bacillus cerus was added to the water(2). Pure culture studies have shown that phenylcarbamates are degraded to aniline which in turn is then metabolized to catechol and used in the TCA cycle(3)."

Homogeneity and stability were determined in parallel studies for dietary concentrations of 100 and 15,000 ppm. Homogeneity was within + or -10% and stability data indicated 101 and 109% of nominal values. F0 animals were inspected daily for clinical signs and were weighed weekly mating (after approximately 16 weeks on test for F0 animals and at about 100 days of age for F1b parents) was determined by vaginal smear. Lactation period was 4 weeks. F1a, F2a and F2b pups were sacrificed at weaning and subject to gross and histopathological examination. At dietary concentrations up to 5000 ppm there were no effects on appearance, behavior, general condition, mortality, fertility, insemination rate, gestation, viability, duration of pregnancy or sex ratio. No malformations were observed and incidence of stillbirths was unaffected. The lactation index and mean litter size at birth were comparable to those of the controls up to 1000 ppm. At 5000 ppm, the lactation index was in some cases significantly depressed and the litter size was reduced. Body-weight gain was not retarded in the parent animals or in the pups up to 1000 ppm. The body-weight of parents and pups in the 5000 ppm group increased more slowly during the rearing period. Food intake was unaffected up to 1000 ppm. Following 5000 ppm F1b rats consumed less food. The macroscopic examination of the dissected F1b and F2b pups revealed no changes of organs related to the treatment. The histopathological investigations revealed indications of increased breakdown of the red blood cells from 200 ppm upwards in F0 and F1b parents, which was identified by an increased incidence of siderosis in the liver and/or spleen. At 5000 ppm increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was frequently observed and increased spleen weights were recorded. At 200 ppm and above (F1b) and from 1000 ppm and above (F0) spleens were commonly dark in color. No indications of organ damage were found in the other organs of parent animals in the gross pathology examinations nor on the basis of the organ weights or histopathological investigations. In all dosage groups, therefore, signs of increased breakdown of erythrocytes were found. The dose of 200 ppm of propham was therefore toxic to parental animals. Based on effects on lactation index, food intake and body-weight gain, a NOAEL for reproduction of 1000 ppm equal to 80 mg/kg bw/day, was determined.

Three-week-old wheat and 5-week-old sugarbeet and alfalfa plants were treated with 14C-propham in liquid culture for 1, 2, and 4 days. Other plants were placed in treated soil at 10 weeks after germination and grown for 15 weeks. Wheat absorbed 98%, sugarbeet 93%, and alfalfa 81% of the propham from solution after 4 days. Propham was translocated in all species. Under liquid culture, three polar metabolites of propham were isolated from wheat and alfalfa extracts and one was isolated from sugarbeet extracts. The agylcone moiety of the two most polar wheat metabolites was isopropyl-4-hydroxycarbanilate and that of the least polar metabolite was isopropyl-2-hydroxycarbanilate. The aglycone of all alfalfa and sugarbeet polar metabolites was isopropyl-4-hydroxycarbanilate. Only one polar metabolite was isolated from all soil-treated plants. The aglycone moiety was determined to be isopropyl-4-hydroxycarbanilate. Of the propham absorbed 95, 91, 89, and 36% was metabolized by sugarbeet roots, sugarbeet leaves, wheat leaves, and alfalfa leaves, respectively, after a 4-day liquid culture treatment. Propham was 100% metabolized when applied to plants via soil application.",
