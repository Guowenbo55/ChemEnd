    "Description": "Clethodim is an oxime O-ether resulting from the formal conversion ot the acyclic keto group of 5-[2-(ethylsulfanyl)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-propionylcyclohex-2-en-1-one to the corresponding oxime with subsequent O-alkylation of the oxime by an (E)-3-chloroallyl group. It is used as a selective postemergence herbicide for the control of annual and perennial grasses in numerous crops, including alfalfa, celery, clover, conifers, cotton, cranberries, garlic, onions, ornamentals, peanuts, soybeans, strawberries, sugarbeet, sunflowers, and vegetables; the (-)-enantiomer has been reported to be more active than the (+)-enantiomer. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 6.4.1.2 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) inhibitor. It is an organic sulfide, a cyclic ketone, an organochlorine compound, an oxime O-ether, a beta-diketone and an enol.",

Absorption of 14C-clethodim with the 0.12 kg L\u22121 (15 to 85%) formulation was higher than with the 0.24 kg L\u22121 (5 to 40%) formulation, regardless of presence or absence of adjuvant. There was considerable variation in the effect of adjuvant on 14C-clethodim absorption. When either ammonium sulfate (AMS) or AMS plus crop oil concentrate (COC) was added to the 0.12 kg L\u22121 formulation, 14C-clethodim absorption increased significantly at all harvest times except at 12 HAT compared with 0.12 kg L\u22121 formulation alone, whereas, 14C-clethodim absorption after addition of COC to the 0.12 kg L\u22121 formulation was similar to the 0.12 kg L\u22121 formulation alone up to 24 HAT. Conversely, COC enhanced 14C-absorption at all harvest times when added to 0.24 kg L\u22121 formulation. Most of 14C-clethodim (79 to 100% of absorbed) remained in the treated leaf, independent of formulation or adjuvant. Formulation did not have an impact on distribution of absorbed 14C-clethodim; however, presence of an adjuvant increased movement of 14C-clethodim out of treated leaf. Of the absorbed 14C-label, most remained in the treated leaf. 14C-clethodim that translocated out of the treated leaf remained in the shoot, and negligible amount of 14C-clethodim translocated to roots. These results demonstrated improved absorption of clethodim with formulations containing half the active ingredient (0.12 kg L\u22121) and inclusion of both AMS and COC.",

Imazapic did not affect absorption of [14C]clethodim by goosegrass. Averaged across the two treatments of clethodim alone and clethodim plus imazapic, absorption was 36 and 89% of applied [14C]clethodim at 0.5 and 96 h, respectively. The majority of [14C]clethodim (79% of applied) was absorbed by 24h. Translocation of 14C was not affected by imazapic, and 3.6% of applied 14C had translocated into the portion of the shoot below the treated leaf at 96h after treatment. Metabolism of clethodim was not affected by the presence of imazapic. Three major metabolites of clethodim were detected in treated tissue at all harvest intervals. The majority (58%) of [14C]clethodim was converted to a relative polar metabolite form 96h after treatment, whether clethodim was applied alone or in the presence of imazapic. One day after treatment, the photosynthetic rate in plants treated with imazapic decreased below the rate in the non-treated check, and was less for 8days, the duration of the study. These data suggest that the antagonism of clethodim by imazapic may be caused by imazapic reducing the photosynthetic rate of goosegrass and therefore the sensitivity of ACCase to clethodim.",
