            "Value": "... In this study, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used Nrf2 activator, was initially employed to investigate the potential protective role of Nrf2 activation in saturated fatty acid (SFA)-induced hepatoxicity. As expected, SFA-induced hepatocyte cell death was prevented by tBHQ in both AML-12 mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. However, the protective effect of tBHQ is Nrf2-independent, because the siRNA-mediated Nrf2 silencing did not abrogate tBHQ-conferred protection. Alternatively, our results revealed that autophagy activation was critically involved in the protective effect of tBHQ on lipotoxicity. tBHQ induced autophagy activation and autophagy inhibitors abolished tBHQ's protection. The induction of autophagy by tBHQ exposure was demonstrated by the increased accumulation of LC3 puncta, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic flux (LC3-II conversion in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors). Subsequent mechanistic investigation discovered that tBHQ exposure activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and siRNA-mediated AMPK gene silencing abolished tBHQ-induced autophagy activation, indicating that AMPK is critically involved in tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction. Furthermore, our study provided evidence that tBHQ-induced autophagy activation is required for its Nrf2-activating property. Collectively, our data uncover a novel mechanism for tBHQ in protecting hepatocytes against SFA-induced lipotoxicity. tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction contributes not only to its hepatoprotective effect, but also to its Nrf2-activating property."

H7 hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in influenza entry and thus HA presents an attractive target for antivirals. Previous studies have suggested that the small molecule tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) inhibits the entry of influenza H3 HA by binding to the stem loop of HA and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation of HA, thereby disrupting the membrane fusion step. Based on amino acid sequence, structure and immunogenicity, H7 is a related Group 2 HA. In this work we show, using a pseudovirus entry assay, that TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry, as well as H3 HA-mediated entry, with an IC50 ~ 6 uM. Using NMR, we show that TBHQ binds to the H7 stem loop region. STD NMR experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of TBHQ makes extensive contact with the H7 HA surface. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that TBHQ inhibits influenza entry by stabilizing the H7 HA neutral pH conformation. Together, this work suggests that the stem loop region of H7 HA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and that TBHQ, which is a widely used food preservative, is a promising lead compound."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Developmental or Reproductive Toxicity/ Oxidative stress is an important mechanism of chemical toxicity, contributing to teratogenesis and to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Developing animals may be especially sensitive to chemicals causing oxidative stress. The developmental expression and inducibility of anti-oxidant defenses through activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) affect susceptibility to oxidants, but the embryonic response to oxidants is not well understood. To assess the response to chemically mediated oxidative stress and how it may vary during development, zebrafish embryos, eleutheroembryos, or larvae at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post fertilization (dpf) were exposed to DMSO (0.1%), tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ; 10 uM) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; 2 nM) for 6 hr. Transcript abundance was assessed by real-time qRT-PCR and microarray. qRT-PCR showed strong (4- to 5-fold) induction of gstp1 by tBHQ as early as 1 dpf. tBHQ also induced gclc (2 dpf), but not sod1, nqo1, or cyp1a. TCDD induced cyp1a but none of the other genes. Microarray analysis showed that 1477 probes were significantly different among the DMSO-, tBHQ-, and TCDD-treated eleutheroembryos at 4 dpf. There was substantial overlap between genes induced in developing zebrafish and a set of marker genes induced by oxidative stress in mammals. Genes induced by tBHQ in 4-dpf zebrafish included those involved in glutathione synthesis and utilization, signal transduction, and DNA damage/stress response. The strong induction of hsp70 determined by microarray was confirmed by qRT-PCR and by use of transgenic zebrafish expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the hsp70 promoter. Genes strongly down-regulated by tBHQ included mitfa, providing a molecular explanation for the loss of pigmentation in tBHQ-exposed embryos. These data show that zebrafish embryos are responsive to oxidative stress as early as 1 dpf, that responsiveness varies with development in a gene-specific manner, and that the oxidative stress response is substantially conserved in vertebrate animals."

Nuclear translocation of FoxO3a is triggered by trophic factor withdrawal, oxidative stress and the stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Receptor activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways retains FoxO3a in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the transcriptional activation of death-promoting genes. We hypothesized that phenolic antioxidants such as tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), which is known to stimulate PI3K-Akt signaling, would inhibit FoxO3a translocation and activity. Treatment of cultured cortical neurons with NMDA increased the nuclear localization of FoxO3a, reduced the phosphorylation of FoxO3a, increased caspase activity and up-regulated Fas ligand expression. In contrast the phenolic antioxidant, tBHQ, caused retention of FoxO3a in the cytosol coincident with enhanced PI3K- dependent phosphorylation of FoxO3a. tBHQ-induced nuclear exclusion of FoxO3a was associated with reduced FoxO-mediated transcriptional activity. Exposure of neurons to tBHQ inhibited NMDA-induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3a, prevented NMDA-induced up-regulation of FoxO-mediated transcriptional activity, blocked caspase activation and protected neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxic death.

Increased frequencies of CREST-positive micronuclei (indicating chromosone loss) and CREST-negative micronuclei (indicating chromosome breakage) were observed following exposure of cells to HQ hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone. The formation of micronuclei by hydroquinone, but not tert-butyl-hydroquinone, was dependent on arachidonic acid supplementation, indicating activation by prostaglandin H synthase. Since the oxidation of hydroquinones can result in the generation of oxygen radicals, the contribution of oxygen radicals to the formation of chromosomal alterations induced by hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone was investigated. In the presence of a superoxide-generating system consisting of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, a significant increase in micronucleated cells was observed. These induced micronuclei consisted exclusively of CREST-negative micronuclei and their formation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with catalase. Catalase also significantly inhibited the CREST-negative micronuclel induced by hydroquinone and tert-butyl-hydroquinone. In addition, glutathione treatment inhibited both CREST-positive and negative micronuclei induced by these phenolic compounds. ... Both chromosome loss and breakage are induced by these two quinone-forming agents.

The mechanisms underlying that effect were investigated. Death of the seemingly untreated neighboring cells was caused by the more toxic and volatile tBHQ oxidation product tert-butyl-p-benzoquinone (tBQ) present at up to 3 ug/mL in the untreated neighboring wells. tBQ was formed from tBHQ in a non-enzymatic process involving copper ions and oxygen.

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in primary cultured astrocytes by using the natural antioxidant compound tertiary butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). We found that tBHQ increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels. Promoter analysis revealed that tBHQ enhanced HO-1 gene transcription in an antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent manner. In addition, tBHQ increased the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Nrf2 and c-Jun to ARE. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments demonstrated that Nrf2 and c-Jun are involved in the differential modulation of HO-1 expression. Thus, Nrf2 knockdown reduced the basal level of HO-1 expression but did not affect the fold induction by tBHQ. On the other hand, knockdown of c-Jun diminished tBHQ-mediated induction of HO-1 without affecting basal expression. The data suggest that Nrf2 generally modulates the basal expression of HO-1, while c-Jun mediates HO-1 induction in response to tBHQ. The results of co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a physical interaction between Nrf2 and c-Jun in tBHQ-treated astrocytes.

Both test systems showed that BHA and TBQ (probably due to lack of reductase activity in vitro) were not capable of inducting oxidative DNA damage. TBHQ, however, appeared to be a strong inactivator of phage DNA as well as a potent inducer of 8-oxodG formation. Addition of radical scavengers showed that this damage was due to formation of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Addition of iron chelators and metal ions showed that the one-electron oxidations of TBHQ via the semiquinone radical into TBQ are toxic via the formation of oxygen radicals and are not directly due to the hydroquinone itself or the formation of semiquinone radicals. Although peroxidation of TBHQ by prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) is indicated to result in a superoxide anion burst, this is not accompanied by an increase in oxidative DNA damage in vitro. This might be due to the use of hydrogen peroxide as a substrate by PHS itself, consequently resulting in less formation of hydroxyl radicals. Oxidation of TBHQ by lipoxygenases showed that no semiquinone radicals or oxygen radicals were formed, probably due to a two-electron oxidation of TBHQ directly into TBQ. The present results indicate that metabolic activation of BHA yielding reactive oxygen species may induce a carcinogenic potential, since the BHA metabolite TBHQ, appeared to be a strong inducer of oxidative DNA damage."
