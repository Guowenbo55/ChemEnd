            "Value": "The organophosphorus insecticides have been known for many years to cause cholinergic crisis in humans as a result of the inhibition of the critical enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The interactions of the activated, toxic insecticide metabolites (termed oxons) with acetylcholinesterase have been studied extensively for decades. However, more recent studies have suggested that the interactions of certain anticholinesterase organophosphates with acetylcholinesterase are more complex than previously thought since their inhibitory capacity has been noted to change as a function of inhibitor concentration. In the present report, chlorpyrifos oxon (O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphate) was incubated with human recombinant acetylcholinesterase in the presence of p-nitrophenyl acetate in order to better characterize kinetically the interactions of this oxon with enzyme. Determination of the dissociation constant, K(d), and the phophorylation rate constant, k(2), for chlorpyrifos oxon with a range of oxon and p-nitrophenyl acetate concentrations revealed that K(d), but not k(2), changed as a function of oxon concentration. Changes in p-nitrophenyl acetate concentrations did not alter these same kinetic parameters. The inhibitory capacity of chlorpyrifos oxon, as measured by k(i) (k(2)/K(d)), was also affected as a result of the concentration-dependent alterations in binding affinity. These results suggest that the concentration-dependent interactions of chlorpyrifos oxon with acetylcholinesterase resulted from a different mechanism than the concentration-dependent interactions of acetylthiocholine. In the latter case, substrate bound to the peripheral anionic site of acetylcholinesterase has been shown to reduce enzyme activity by blocking the release of the product thiocholine from the active site gorge. With chlorpyrifos oxon, the rate of release of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is irrelevant since the active site is not available to interact with other oxon molecules after phosphorylation of Ser-203 has occurred."

Thus, despite the fact that CPF oxon is a much more potent AChE inhibitor, it is the native compound (CPF) that induces expression of the neurotoxic AChE-S isoform. For in vivo exposures, 1 mg/kg CPF had little or no effect, but 0.5 or 2 mg/kg DZN induced both AChE-R and AChE-S, with a greater effect in males. ... /The/ results indicate that nonenzymatic functions of AChE variants may participate in and be predictive of the relative developmental neurotoxicity of organophosphates, and that the various organophosphates differ in the degree to which they activate this mechanism."

Microdialysis was conducted at 1, 4 and 7 days after CPF exposure for measurement of acetylcholine levels in striatum. Rats were then sacrificed and the contralateral striatum and diaphragm were collected for biochemical measurements. Few overt signs of cholinergic toxicity were noted in any rats. Body weight gain was significantly affected in the high-dose (279 mg/kg) group only, while motor activity (nocturnal rearing) was significantly reduced in all CPF-treated groups at one day (84 mg/kg) or from 1-4 days (156 and 279 mg/kg) after dosing. Cholinesterase activities in both diaphragm and striatum were markedly inhibited (50-92%) in a time-dependent manner, but there were relatively minimal dose-related changes. In contrast, time- and dose-dependent changes in striatal acetylcholine levels were noted, with significantly higher levels noted in the high-dose group compared to other groups. Maximal increases in striatal acetylcholine levels were observed at 4-7 days after dosing (84 mg/kg, 7-9-fold; 156 mg/kg, 10-13-fold; 279 mg/kg, 35-57-fold). Substantially higher acetylcholine levels were noted when an exogenous cholinesterase inhibitor was included in the perfusion buffer, but CPF treatment-related differences were substantially lower in magnitude under those conditions. The results suggest that marked differences in acetylcholine accumulation can occur with dosages of CPF eliciting relatively similar degrees of cholinesterase inhibition. Furthermore, the minimal expression of classic signs of cholinergic toxicity in the presence of extensive brain acetylcholine accumulation suggests that some compensatory process(es) downstream from synaptic neurotransmitter accumulation limits the expression of toxicity following acute CPF exposure."

Chlorpyrifos inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity, resulting in central and peripheral stimulation of central cholinergic pathways involved in blood pressure regulation. The spontaneously hypertensive rat has been shown to be more sensitive to central cholinergic stimulation. Therefore, ... /it was/ hypothesized that these rats would be more susceptible and sustain a greater hypertensive response when exposed to chlorpyrifos. Heart rate, cardiac contractility, core temperature, and blood pressure were monitored by radiotelemetry in SHRs and their Wistar Kyoto (WKY) normotensive controls following exposure to chlorpyrifos (10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg, orally). Baseline blood pressure of SHRs was approximately 35 mmHg above that of WKYs prior to dosing. SHRs exhibited a greater and more sustained elevation in diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure following exposure to 25 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos. The rise in blood pressure lasted for approximately 56 hours in SHRs compared to approximately 32 hours in WKYs. Chlorpyrifos also led to a prolonged elevation in daytime heart rate in both strains. There was a transient elevation in cardiac contractility in both strains lasting approximately 7 hr after exposure to chlorpyrifos. The hypothermic response to chlorpyrifos was similar in magnitude and duration for both strains. Plasma cholinesterase activity measured 4 hr after exposure to 25 mg/kg chlorpyrifos was inhibited to approximately 40% of control levels in both strains. Using the SHR strain as a model to study susceptible populations, the data suggest that individuals with a genetic predisposition to hypertension may be more susceptible from exposure to organophosphate-based insecticide, as manifested by an exacerbated hypertensive response."

CD1 mice were exposed to a broad range of acute (12.5-100.0 mg/kg) and subacute (1.56-25 mg/kg/day from 5 to 30 days) CPF oral doses. Functional and biochemical parameters such as brain and serum cholinesterase (ChE) and liver xenobiotic metabolizing system, including the biotransformation of CPF itself, have been studied and the no observed effect levels (NOELs) identified. Mice seem to be more susceptible than rats at least to acute CPF treatment (oral LD50 4.5-fold lower). The species-related differences were not so evident after repeated exposures. In mice a good correlation was observed between brain ChE inhibition and classical cholinergic signs of toxicity. After CPF-repeated treatment, mice seemed to develop some tolerance to CPF-induced effects, which could not be attributed to an alteration of P450-mediated CPF hepatic metabolism. CPF-induced effects on hepatic microsomal carboxylesterase (CE) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels observed at an early stage of treatment and then recovered after 30 days, suggest that the detoxifying mechanisms are actively involved in the protection of CPF-induced effects and possibly in the induction of tolerance in long term exposure. The mouse could be considered a suitable experimental model for future studies on the toxic action of organophosphorus pesticides focused on mechanisms, long term and age-related effects."

When tested in adulthood, chlorpyrifos-exposed animals displayed elevations in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, without underlying alterations in nonesterified free fatty acids and glycerol. This effect was restricted to males. Similarly, in the postprandial state, male rats showed hyperinsulinemia in the face of normal circulating glucose levels but demonstrated appropriate reduction of circulating insulin concentrations after fasting. These outcomes and sex selectivity resemble earlier findings at the cellular level, which identified hepatic hyperresponsiveness to gluconeogenic inputs from beta-adrenoceptors or glucagon receptors. Our results thus indicate that apparently subtoxic neonatal chlorpyrifos exposure, devoid of effects on viability or growth but within the parameters of human fetal or neonatal exposures, produce a metabolic pattern for plasma lipids and insulin that resembles the major adult risk factors for atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

In response, the US EPA and NIEHS collaborated on a series of multidisciplinary studies. The exposure paradigm was designed to encompass the development of all three organ systems (in the rat, mid-gestation through weaning and/or sexual maturity). Broad batteries of tests were used to evaluate the structure and function of each organ system in the offspring. Tissue levels of chemical and general pathology were also measured. Where possible, litter-mates were used for the various endpoints, to draw stronger conclusions regarding relative organ system vulnerability. Five pesticides from different chemical classes, targeting different organ systems, were evaluated: methoxychlor (organochlorine), carbaryl (carbamate), chlorpyrifos (organophosphate), tebuconazole (triazole), and heptachlor (cyclodiene). A comparison of these data reveals two critical findings. First, no single organ system was consistently more sensitive than another. Developmental/reproductive measures were most sensitive to the effects of methoxychlor and carbaryl. The nervous system was most sensitive to tebuconazole, chlorpyrifos, and heptachlor, whereas the immune system was most altered by low doses of methoxychlor and heptachlor. Second, the lowest effective doses for methoxychlor and heptachlor were lower than those reported in the literature. Thus, adverse health effects following developmental exposure may occur at lower doses than previously expected. These multidisciplinary studies provide valuable and unique data; furthermore, this shows that these organ systems may be evaluated in a single combined study. This strongly supports the need for more thorough evaluation of the nervous, immune, and reproductive systems during development."

Rats were placed on modest food restriction to provide incentive to seek the food reward in the study. Rats were trained and selected for the study, based on positional memory performance. In a given test, a rat was presented with one of two retractable levers. The rat was to press the lever offered, cross the cage and interrupt a beam at the food cup within 10 seconds, and then return to the side of the cage with the levers. At this time, both levers would be presented. The rat was expected to select and press the correct lever (i.e., the one just presented a few seconds earlier) within 10 seconds after leaving the food cup station. A correct choice made a food reward available at the food cup. In addition to the above test, the task was made more difficult by involving progressively longer delays (up to 15 seconds) between the first lever press and the time in which a nose poke in the food cup would extend the levers (called the delayed matching-to-position or DMPT paradigm). These rats were also examined twice daily on treatment days during the 4-wk dosing period: observations were about 3 hr and 21 hr after the most recent treatment.

These data suggest that learning the contingency between an action and reward may be accelerated by chronic exposure to CPF and inhibited by previous symptomatic exposure to CPF, and that persistent cognitive impairment may follow if CPF exposure inhibits brain ChE activity and is accompanied by acute doses sufficient to induce signs of toxicity."

The present study elucidates a possible mechanism by which CPF and cold stress interaction cause(s) mitochondrial dysfunction in an age-related manner. In this study, the activity levels of Krebs cycle enzymes and electron transport chain (ETC) protein complexes were assessed in the isolated fraction of mitochondria. CPF and cold stress (15 and 20 \u00b0C) exposure either individually or in combination decreased the activity level of Krebs cycle enzymes and ETC protein complexes in discrete regions of rat CNS. The findings confirm that cold stress produces significant synergistic effect in CPF intoxicated aging rats. The synergism between CPF and cold stress at 15 \u00b0C caused a higher depletion of respiratory enzymes in comparison with CPF and cold stress alone and together at 20 \u00b0C indicating the extent of deleterious functional alterations in discrete regions of brain and spinal cord (SC) which may result in neurodegeneration and loss in neuronal metabolic control. Hence, co-exposure of CPF and cold stress is more dangerous than exposure of either alone. Among the discrete regions studied, the cerebellum and medulla oblongata appears to be the most susceptible regions when compared to cortex and SC.

Metabolism involves CYP450 activation and detoxification of CPF to CPF-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), as well as cholinesterase (acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase), carboxylesterase (CaE), and A-esterase (PON-1) detoxification of CPF-oxon to TCP. The pharmacokinetics of CPF, TCP, and the extent of blood (plasma/RBC), and brain ChE inhibition in rats were determined on postnatal days (PND)-5, -12, and -17 following oral gavage administration of 1 and 10 mg CPF/kg of body weight. As has been seen in adult animals, for all preweanling ages the blood TCP exceeded the CPF concentration, and within each age group there was no evidence of non-linear kinetics over the dose range evaluated. Consistent with previous results, younger animals demonstrated a greater sensitivity to ChE inhibition as evident by the age-dependent inhibition of plasma, RBC, and brain ChE. The brain may be particularly sensitive in younger animals (i.e. PND-5) due to substantially lower levels of ChE activity relative to later preweanling stages and adults. Of particular importance was the observation that even in rats as young as PND-5, the CYP450 metabolic capacity was adequate to metabolize CPF to both TCP and CPF-oxon based on the detection of TCP in blood and extensive ChE inhibition (biomarker of CPF-oxon) at all ages. In addition, the increase in the blood TCP concentration (approximately 3-fold) in PND-17 rats relative to the response in the younger rats, are consistent with an increase in CYP450 metabolic capacity with age. This is the first reported study that evaluated both the pharmacokinetics of the parent pesticide, the major metabolite, and the extent of ChE inhibition as a function of preweanling age. The results suggest that in the preweanling rat, CPF was rapidly absorbed and metabolized, and the extent of metabolism and ChE inhibition was age-dependent."

In adults, DSAR was reduced at 4 and 24 hr after exposure, but increased 96 hr after CPF exposure. In juveniles, MAF was reduced in both brain regions at 24 hr after 0.5LD10 exposure and at 24 and 96 hr after LD10 exposure in cortex. A later reduction in MAF was noted in adult tissues (i.e. only at 96 hr after LD10 treatment). Together, the results suggest that ACh release dynamics in brain vary markedly during postnatal maturation and that acute CPF exposure can alter ACh release in an age-related manner. The functional status of presynaptic processes regulating neurotransmitter release may contribute to age-related neurotoxicity elicited by high-dose exposures to chlorpyrifos."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Prolonged exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides may produce cognitive deficits reflective of hippocampal injury in both humans and rodents. Recent work has indicated that microtubule trafficking is also adversely affected by exposure to the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, suggesting a novel mode of OP-induced neurotoxicity. The present studies examined effects of prolonged exposure to chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, immunoreactivity (IR) of microtubule-associated proteins, neuronal injury, and tubulin polymerization using in vitro organotypic slice cultures of rat hippocampus and bovine tubulin. Cultures were exposed to CPO (0.1-10 uM) in cell culture medium for 1-7 days, a regimen producing progressive reductions in AChE activity of 15-60%. Cytotoxicity (somatic uptake of the non-vital marker propidium iodide), as well as IR of alpha-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein-2 (a/b) [MAP-2], was assessed 1, 3, and 7 days after the start of CPO exposure. As early as 24 h after the start of exposure, CPO-induced deficits in MAP-2 IR were evident and progressive in each region of slice cultures at concentrations as low as 0.1 uM. CPO exposure did not alter alpha-tubulin IR at any time point. Concentration-dependent injury in the cornu ammonis (CA)1 pyramidal cell layer and to a lesser extent, CA3 and dentate cells, was evident 3 days after the start of CPO exposure (>or=0.1 uM) and was greatest after 7 days. Tubulin polymerization assays indicated that CPO (>or=0.1 uM) markedly inhibited the polymerization of purified tubulin and MAP-rich tubulin, though effects on MAP-rich tubulin were more pronounced. These data suggest that exposure to CPO produces a progressive decrease in neuronal viability that may be associated with impaired microtubule synthesis and/or function."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ ... In vitro inhibition studies indicated that ChE in neonatal tissues was markedly more sensitive to inhibition by the active metabolite of chlorpyrifos (i.e., chlorpyrifos oxon, CPO) than enzyme in adult tissues (IC(50) values: neonates, 17 nM; adults, 200 nM). Chelation of free calcium with EDTA had relatively little effect on in vitro cholinesterase inhibition, suggesting that differential A-esterase activity was not responsible for the age-related difference in cholinesterase sensitivity between age groups. Pre-incubation of neonatal and adult tissues with selective inhibitors of AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) indicated that a majority (82-90%) of ChE activity in the heart of both neonates and adults was BChE. The rapid onset (by 4hr after dosing) of changes in muscarinic receptor binding in adult heart may be a reflection of the more potent direct binding to muscarinic receptors by chlorpyrifos oxon previously reported in adult tissues. The results suggest that ChE activity (primarily BChE) in neonatal heart may be inherently more sensitive to inhibition by some anticholinesterases and that toxicologically significant binding to muscarinic receptors may be possible with acute chlorpyrifos intoxication, potentially contributing to age-related differences in sensitivity."

The predominant effect on the heart from the peripheral action of accumulated ACh is bradycardia, resulting in a fall in cardiac output. Higher doses usually cause a fall in blood pressure, often as a consequence of effects of anticholinesterase agents on the medullary vasomotor centers of the CNS. /Anticholinesterase agents/"

Freshly eclosed first instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for hsp70 (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9) were fed on 0.015-150.0ppb dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos mixed food. Virgin flies eclosing from the normal and contaminated food were pair-mated to examine the effect of the test chemicals on reproduction of the exposed organisms. Expression of hsp70, sex peptide (SP or Acp70A), accessory gland protein (Acp36DE) and tissue damage was examined in reproductive organs of adult fly. Exposed organisms exhibited a dose-dependent significantly reduced reproductive outcome and males were found to be more sensitive than females. Hsp70 expression was restricted only within the testis lobes of male fly while it was not induced in the ovary of the female. In concurrence with absence of hsp70 expression in the accessory glands of male fly, tissue damage was evident in them. Acp70A and Acp36DE expression were found to be significantly downregulated at the higher concentrations of the test chemicals. The study suggests that (i) dichlorvos is more deleterious to fly reproduction compared to chlorpyrifos with an adverse effect on Acp70A and Acp36DE expression required to facilitate normal reproduction; (ii) hsp70 may be used as a marker of cellular damage against dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos in Drosophila."

An average Koc value of 6,070 was determined in soil column studies using 3 agricultural soils(2). An experimental Koc value of 13,600 was reported for a single soil  type(3). After incubation for 1 day in sediment from an urban freshwater stream, the Koc for chlorpyrifos was reported as 2,900 to 17,000(4). Koc values of 2740 and 995 were determined in a clay loam and high clay soil respectively, with a mean Koc of 1868(5). In a review of the environmental fate of chlorpyrifos, Koc values of 995-31,000 were reported in a variety of soils(6). Based on multiple Koc values, chlorpyrifos was assigned a selected Koc value of 9930(7). According to a classification scheme(8), these measured Koc values suggest that chlorpyrifos is expected to have low to no mobility in soil. Greater than 99% of chlorpyrifos applied to a loam soil remained in the upper 2.5 cm soil layer after periodic irrigation with overhead sprinklers indicating relative immobility(9). In laboratory studies using a sandy loam soil, chlorpyrifos was determined to be relatively immobile(10). In a simulated ecosystem study, the chlorpyrifos concentration in the sediment was as much as 4 times greater than in the water-phase(11). Chlorpyrifos applied to a natural pond was observed to rapidly absorb to bottom sediments(12). Koc of >7430 was observed with sediment in a nursery recycling pond study(13)."
