It is an aromatic ether, an organochlorine compound, an organofluorine compound, a member of pyridines and a carboxylic ester. It is functionally related to a 2-(4-{[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]oxy}phenoxy)propanoic acid and a 2-ethoxyethanol.",

Uptake of [^14C]HE from simultaneous application in mixture with a phenoxy herbicide was inhibited by the latter in the order MCPB > MCPA > 2,4-D. In mixtures, the foliar absorption of [^14C]HE was reduced more by salts of the phenoxy herbicides than by the corresponding butyl esters. 2,4-D-butyl enhanced uptake of [^14C]HE. The application rate of phenoxy herbicides (from 0.5 to 1.5 kg a.e. ha^(-1)) did not affect the uptake of [^14C]HE but did influence translocation. Movement of [^14C]herbicide out of the treated leaf was less than 5% of the total ^14C applied; translocation was significantly reduced by all phenoxy herbicides and was antagonized most by 2,4-D-salt and least by MCPB-butyl. Phenoxy salts invariably reduced [^14C]HE translocation more than the corresponding butyl esters. Prior application of phenoxy salts reduced uptake of [^14C]HE, but this antagonism was reduced as the time interval between spray applications increased. Translocation of ^14C out of the treated leaf was antagonized most by prior application of 2,4-D and by phenoxy salt formulations. When applied up to 2 days after HE, phenoxy salts reduced uptake, but translocation of ^14C was generally unaffected.",
