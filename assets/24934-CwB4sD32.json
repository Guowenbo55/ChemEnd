Major histopathologic findings in animals of the high-dose groups included multifocal myocardial necrosis and pulmonary alveolar vasculitis with pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Analysis of liver, kidney cortex, heart, blood, and serum revealed linear, dose-dependent increases in selenium concentration. However, tissue selenium concentration in selenomethionine-treated lambs were significantly greater than that in lambs treated with equivalent doses of sodium selenite. To estimate the oxidative effects of these selenium compounds in vivo, liver vitamin E concentration also was measured. Sodium selenite, but not selenomethionine administration resulted in decreased liver vitamin E concentration.

This study reports the cardiovascular effects brought about in anesthetized Landrace pigs by 2 mg selenium/kg body weight intravenously as either sodium selenite or dimethylselenide. Sodium selenite dosing was characterized by a dramatic fall in systemic blood pressure with an increase in cardiac output and heart frequency. The only significant change elicited by dimethylselenide was a linear rise of cardiac output. Neither of the tested compounds significantly affected pulmonary arterial pressure. These results suggest that under the experimental conditions in this study, sodium selenite induces a vasculogenic shock without primarily affecting cardiac performance. The lack of detrimental effects on cardiovascular parameters with dimethylselenide indicates the importance of methylation in detoxifying excess selenium."

At the 3 or 6 mg/kg Se level, the rats fed SeM suffered slighter hepatic damage than those fed sodium selenite and in male rats slighter than female rats. The abnormal change of ratio of liver weight to body weight was found to be more obvious both in female rats and in selenite-treated rats.

Male BALB/c mice, 6-7 weeks of age, were exposed continuously to 0, 1, 3 or 9 ppm of Se as sodium selenite or seleno-L-methionine in the drinking water for 14 days.

Single-cell splenocyte cultures were made from the spleens and used to determine the effects of Se treatment on mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis and cytokine production. There were no changes in the 0 and 1 ppm Se groups as selenite. The thymus/body weight ratio was significantly reduced at 3 ppm Se as sodium selenite, and all other parameters remained unaffected. Exposure to 9 ppm of Se as sodium selenite resulted in marked decrease in body weight gain and relative organ weights. Treatment of mice with 9 ppm Se as sodium selenite increased erythrocyte counts in peripheral blood, reduced splenic cellularity, but increased the basal rate of splenocyte proliferation and induced a dose-dependent increase in phytohemagglutinin-P-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Sodium selenite at this dose increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated splenic macrophages. Mice exposed to Se as seleno-L-methionine in the drinking water did not display any effects on the parameters examined at the dose range in this study.

            "Value": "/VETERINARY CASE REPORTS/ In crossbred cow calves given sodium selenite (0.25 mg/kg body weight) for 16 weeks the treatment resulted in characteristic signs of subchronic selenosis (ie, alopecia, cracking, and enlargement of hooves, interdigital lesions, ring formation on the coronet region, and gangrene at tip of the tail). The treatment resulted in a significant rise of blood selenium levels and concurrent increases in erythrocytic glutathione peroxidase activity. Blood glutathione levels were lowered. Selenosis caused oxidative stress as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation. Glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were significantly increased."

Rat embryos at day 9.5 or 10.5 of gestation were cultured for 48 or 24 hr, respectively, in the presence of sodium selenate (100 or 150 uM) or sodium selenite (20 or 30 uM). Proteins from the embryo proper and yolk sac membrane were analyzed ... for quantitative changes from those in control embryos. ... Growth inhibition and morphological abnormalities of cultured embryos were observed in all the Se treatment groups. By the analysis of the embryo proper, actin-binding proteins were identified as proteins with quantitative changes by selenate: increased phosphorylated-cofilin 1, increased phosphorylated-destrin, decreased drebrin E, and decreased myosin light polypeptide 3. Many proteins showed similar changes between selenate and selenite, including increased ATP-synthase, decreased acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, and decreased pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase-like. In the yolk sac membrane, antioxidant proteins were identified for protein spots with quantitative changes by selenite: increased peroxiredoxin 1 and increased glutathione S-transferase. The identified proteins with quantitative changes by selenate or selenite were considered to be candidate proteins involved in Se embryotoxicity: the actin-binding proteins for selenate embryotoxicity, proteins with the similar changes for the common Se embryotoxicity and antioxidant proteins for modification of Se embryotoxicity by redox-related treatments. These proteins may also be used as biomarkers in developmental toxicity studies."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ /This/ study was performed to examine the mechanism by which selenate ameliorates the insulin sensitivity in type II diabetic dbdb mice. Therefore, 21-adult female dbdb mice were randomly assigned to three experimental groups (0Se, SeIV and SeVI) with seven animals per group. Mice of group 0Se were fed with a selenium-deficient diet (<0.02 mg Se/kg) based on wheat and torula yeast for 8 weeks whereas the mice of groups SeIV (selenite) and SeVI (selenate) were fed with sodium selenite and sodium selenate (up to 35% of the LD(50) for mice in eighth week), in addition to the diet by daily tube feeding. Eight weeks of selenate application led to significantly elevated insulin sensitivity in comparison with selenium deficiency and selenite application. The activity of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as important negative regulators of insulin signalling was reduced from 53.8% to 22.5% in the liver and skeletal muscle of selenate-treated mice in comparison with the selenium deficient and selenite-treated controls, suggesting an inhibition of PTPs by intermediary selenate metabolites... Selenium metabolites in the oxidation state +IV were found to be the actual inhibitors of PTP activity. In conclusion, ... one possible mechanism by which supranutritional selenate doses enhance insulin sensitivity in type II diabetic dbdb mice is based on the inhibition of PTPS as negative regulators of insulin signalling. Moreover the cellular metabolism of selenate including its intermediary reduction to the oxidation state +IV seems to play a crucial role during this process. /Selenite and selenate/"
