The addition of barban formulation additives, technical barban, or the nonionic surfactant polyoxyethylene 6-tridecylether increased the absorption of 14C-flamprop-methyl. Translocation of 14C-flamprop-methyl was mainly acropetal, unaffected by the addition of barban. Barban absorption increased with the addition of flamprop-methyl and polyoxyethylene-6-tridecylether. However, translocation and metabolism of the herbicides were not significantly influenced by each other. This study suggests that increased absorption of both herbicides is the primary mechanism driving their synergistic interaction in wild oat.",
