Rabbits were more sensitive than guinea pigs when exposed to nitroethane by inhalation (only 2 of each species were exposed). All animals exposed to 30,000 ppm for 1.5 hr died but exposure to 25,000 for 2 hr was lethal only to rabbits. All animals exposed to the higher doses showed lacrimation and conjunctival discharge, dyspnea and, in some rabbits, audible rales. Conjunctival and respiratory tract irritation were evident early during exposure. At necropsy, marked acute pulmonary congestion with edema was a notable finding, however, it was not sufficient alone to account for death. In 2 animals exposed by inhalation, hemorrhage of the anterior turbinates was seen. Nitroethane caused significant cerebral congestion and edema. Some degree of liver damage was evident in all animals exposed to large nitroethane conc, regardless of the route of administration. Necrosis and fatty degeneration of the liver were common pathological findings. Changes in the kidneys consisted of edema, pallor and cloudy swelling. Application of nitroethane to the skin produced no injuries or deaths and no significant pathological changes."

Exposure to 1000 ppm nitroethane produced elevated methemoglobin levels in rats and mice, although the effects were less severe in mice. Cyanosis, increased numbers of reticulocytes and Heinz bodies and an associated splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis were seen in rats. Degenerative and inflammatory changes in the olfactory nasal epithelium and evidence of salivary gland toxicity were noted in rats and mice. Other pathological changes induced by exposure to 1000 ppm nitroethane were hepatocellular vacuolization in rats, and multinucleated spermatids in mice. The toxic effects were reduced in both species at the lower doses. Exposure to 100 ppm nitroethane produced minimal toxicity in both species."

These exposure levels were well above those experienced in the workplace. At the end of the 2 yr study the results indicate there were no pharmacological effects from these exposures, no effect on mortality of either sex at either level of exposure, a slight reduction in body weights of both sexes of both exposure groups which may have been due to additional factors as no specific dose response relationship could be established for the weight reduction, no effect on hematology (including erythrocyte count, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, or hemoglobin), changes in certain serum chemistry parameters but no biologically significant group differences, no biologically significant effects of nitroethane exposure on organ weights, and no significant difference in the nonneoplastic or neoplastic pathology related to exposure to nitroethane. There were three male rats with nodular hyperplasia of the liver and one female with hepatocarcinoma. These findings did not differ significantly from those found in the control groups, but they do indicate a normal spontaneous risk of hepatic nodules in aged rats."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that nitroethane is expected to have very high mobility in soil. However, laboratory studies indicate that nitroethane may adsorb to some soil types(SRC). Using a high organic-content peat as a model for soil organic matter, nitroethane had a vapor sorption of nearly 80 mg vapor uptake/g dry peat at a relative pressure of 0.3 at 24 \u00b0C over a 2 to 3 week period; at a relative pressure of 1, a partition capacity of 272 mg/g peat was calculated(3). The nitro group of nitroethane may promote hydrogen bonding to clay and the polarity of the molecule may also allow hydrophilic-coordinative adsorption(4)."
