Thirteen groups of weanling Sprague Dawley rats were given one of the trichlorobenzenes, at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ppm in corn oil, or corn oil alone. After 13 wk all animals were anesthetized with ether and exsanguinated via the abdominal aorta. Clinical examination showed no signs of toxicity except reduced weight gain in some groups. High dose groups of treated males had a general trend towards lower weight gain with statistically significant weight gain suppression only seen in males treated with 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene at 10 of 1000 ppm. The liver to body weight ratios of males receiving the highest doses of the three trichlorobenzenes were significantly higher than controls. Kidney weights were higher for some groups of males. Trichlorobenzene exposure did not affect serum sodium, potassium, inorganic phosphate, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, total protein, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, or any hematological or urinary parameter. Hepatic microsomal aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase activities were significantly elevated in males fed 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 1000 ppm. Aminopyrine demethylase activity was significantly elevated in females. Histopathologic changes related to treatment were seen in liver, thyroid, and kidney for all three isomers. The changes were mild in nature and judged to be significant only at the highest dose level, but they were more severe in males than in females. Microscopic changes in the liver consisted of mild to moderate increases in cytoplasmic volume and anisokaryosis of hepatocytes. Changes in the thyroid included reduction in both follicular size and colloid density. Only 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene resulted in mild to moderate renal changes in the convoluted tubules which were characterized by eosinophilic inclusions, enlargement and anisokaryosis of the lining cells and hyperplasia of the tubular epithelial cells. Only changes associated with the 1000 ppm dose level of the isomer were considered to be biologically significant. ..."
