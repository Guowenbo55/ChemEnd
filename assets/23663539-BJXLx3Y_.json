Pentachlorophenate levels in organs (liver and gall bladder), the remaining fish, and the percent of total pentachlorophenate in the organs remained relatively uniform among the control fish over the 115 day period. Fish exposed to 35 ng/L contained slightly higher pentachlorophenate levels with a higher percentage found in the organs. The highest levels of pentachlorophenate occurred in fish exposed to 660 ng/L where concentration in the organs averaged 2200 ug/kg after 115 days. Thus, uptake from water is an important pathway for the accumulation of pentachlorophenate by rainbow trout."

In the study solvent control group (DMSO), positive control group in iodide uptake measurements (perchlorate sodium) and three pentachlorophenol groups were designed. FRTL-5 cells were treated at the doses of 0.1 ug/mL, 0.3 ug/mL and 0.5 ug/mL of pentachlorophenol for 24 hours. The proliferation of FRTL-5 cells was assayed by 3H - TdR, and the concentrations of thyroglobulin in culture were assayed by RIA. In iodide uptake measurements, and the (125)I uptake of FRTL-5 cells was tested in 12 hr and 24 hr. Pentachlorophenol had no effect on the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells, and the concentrations of thyroglobulin in culture were decreased at the levels of group 0.3 ug/mL and 0.5 ug/mL. The iodide uptakes of FRTL-5 cells were significantly increased at the levels of group 0.33 ug/mL and 0.5 ug/mL in 12 hr. Perchlorate sodium made significant decreases of the iodide uptake of FRTL-5 cells in 12 hr and 24 hr. The mechanism of the thyroid hormone action disrupted by pentachlorophenol may be associated with descreasing thyroglobulin in FRTL-5 cells. /Pentachlorophenol/"

Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate, but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted. /Chlorophenols/"

A total of 30 specific pathogen free (SPF) SD adult male and female rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, and treated with water, 0.33 and 30 mg x kg(-1)x d(-1) of PCP-Na by oral gavage for consecutive 28 days, respectively. After final treatment, histological changes of thyroid were observed by hematoxylin-eosin stain, and the levels of thyroid hormones (total thyroxine (TT(4)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), total triiodothyronine (TT(3)), and free triiodothyronine (FT(3))) were determined by radioimmunoassay. The expression levels of thyroid receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta) mRNA and deiodinases (DioI, DioII and DioIII) mRNA in liver were analyzed by RT-PCR. In high dose group, liver weight coefficient of male and female rats were (4.82 +/- 0.42)% and (4.99 +/- 0.17)%, increased by 36.2% (t = 7.338, P < 0.01) and 41.8% (t = 8.955, P < 0.01), compared to control group ((3.54 +/- 0.14)%, (3.52 +/- 0.19)%), respectively, while the significant changes of kidney or thyroid weight were not observed. In high dose group, the levels of TT(4) and FT(4) in serum of male rats were (64.95 +/- 7.16) nmol/L and (8.16 +/- 2.29) pmol/L, and decreased by 26.6% (t = -3.999, P < 0.01) and 42.3% (t = -4.112, P < 0.01) compared to control group ((88.48 +/- 6.99) nmol/L, (14.13 +/- 1.68) pmol/L). In the same group, FT(4) in serum of female rats was (4.94 +/- 0.89) pmol/L, decreased by 55.5% (t = -3.380, P = 0.012) compared to control group ((11.10 +/- 3.40) pmol/L) and TT(3) and FT(3) in serum of female rats were (1.92 +/- 0.24) nmol/L and (3.05 +/- 0.79) pmol/L, increased by 74.5% (t = 5.263, P < 0.01) and 55.6% (t = 3.495, P < 0.01) compared to control group ((1.10 +/- 0.23) nmol/L, (1.96 +/- 0.32) pmol/L), respectively. PCP-Na didn't affect the expression levels of TRalpha, TRbeta, DioIII mRNA in high dose group, while DioII expression of male rats (0.209 +/- 0.017) down-regulated by 79.2% (t = -5.426, P < 0.01) compared to control group (1.006 +/- 0.137), and DioI expression of female rats (1.844 +/- 0.189) up-regulated by 66.6% (t = 4.359, P < 0.01) compared to control group (1.005 +/- 0.083), indicating DioI and DioII poss different sensitivity to adverse effects induced by PCP-Na between male and female rats. The histopathological results showed that PCP-Na could give rise to hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium cells, and the depletion of colloid. There were no significant changes in serum THs levels and expression of TRalpha, TRbeta, DioI-IIImRNA in low dose group. However, sporadic lymphocytic infiltration, follicles amplification in part and slightly increased in thickness of follicular cells were observed in this group.

Sodium pentachlorophenol (PCP-Na), as a industrial product used in many fields, usually contains a trace of TCDD. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-estrogenic effect of PCP-Na in juvenile goldfish (Carassius auratus) hepatocyte cultures using vitellogenin (VTG) as the biomarker. The ID50 of PCP-Na was investigated and then a series of concentrations (0.001-0.5 ug/mL) of PCP-Na were evaluated to estimate the anti-estrogenic activity. Results showed that PCP-Na was cytotoxic for hepatocytes even at very low concentration < 1.21 ug/mL, and it could not induce VTG at any concentrations tested. Since it failed to stimulate VTG production, the possibility of its anti-estrogenic effect was tested, and a well-known anti-estrogenic compound-tamoxifen was used as positive control. PCP-Na caused a reduction in VTG synthesis in juvenile goldfish (Carassius auratus) hepatocytes at concentrations > 0.1 ug/mL when co-exposure with 1 ug/mL 17beta-estradiol (E2), making its anti-estrogenic activity approximately as potent as tamoxifen. /These/ results indicate that PCP-Na can act as negative modulators of estrogenic function in juvenile goldfish (Carassius auratus) hepatocytes."
