    "Description": "Ethanolamine is a member of the class of ethanolamines that is ethane with an amino substituent at C-1 and a hydroxy substituent at C-2, making it both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a primary amine, a primary alcohol and a member of ethanolamines. It is a conjugate base of an ethanolaminium(1+).",

In general, the dermal irritation observed at the high dose was progressive, beginning with erythema and leading to necrosis, scabs, and scar formation. Doses of 25 mg/kg/day to rabbits produced only minor irritation.

One concern is the possible release of amine solvents and degradation products into the atmosphere, warranting evaluation of potential pulmonary effects from inhalation. The CCS amines monoethanolamine (MEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and piperazine (PIP) underwent oxidative and CO2-mediated degradation for 75 days. C57bl/6N mice were exposed for 7 days by inhalation of 25 ppm neat amine or equivalant concentration in the degraded mixture. The aqueous solutions were nebulized to create the inhalation atmospheres. Pulmonary response was measured by changes in inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cytokine expression in lung tissue. Ames mutagenicity and CHO-K1 micronucleus assays were applied to assess genotoxicity. Chemical analysis of the test atmosphere and liquid revealed complex mixtures, including acids, aldehydes, and other compounds. Exposure to oxidatively degraded MEA increased (p < 0.05) total cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes compared to control mice and caused inflammatory cytokine expression (statistical increase at p < 0.05). MEA and CO2-degraded MEA were the only atmospheres to show statistical (p < 0.05) increase in oxidative stress. CO2 degradation resulted in a different composition, less degradation, and lower observed toxicity (less magnitude and number of effects) with no genotoxicity. Overall, oxidative degradation of the amines studied resulted in enhanced toxicity (increased magnitude and number of effects) compared to the neat chemicals. PMID:25167095"

Therefore, MWCNT were first functionalized with mono-, di-, and triethanolamine (MEA, DEA, and TEA) under microwave technique. Development of functional groups on the MWCNT surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis. Morphological variation was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Then, antimicrobial activities of pristine and functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-MEA, -DEA, and -TEA) were tested against different bacteria species. The studies have been done on four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) as well as four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Streptococcus pneumonia). The results based on minimal inhibitory concentration and radial diffusion assay were shown that the antimicrobial activity of MWCNT-TEA > MWCNT-DEA > MWCNT-MEA > pristine MWCNT. Based on the results, it seems that EA groups could play an important role in antimicrobial activity of MWCNT. /Multiwalled carbon nanotubes functionalized with ethanolamine/"

In anesthetized, artificially ventilated animals, changes in airway opening pressure (P(ao)) were measured as an index of bronchoconstriction. An aerosol of 3.3% MEA solution (0.1 mL/kg) inhaled through a tracheal cannula induced significantly stronger bronchoconstriction than an aerosol of potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (0.1 mL/kg) at the same pH. MEA-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly suppressed by premedication with intravenously injected atropine sulfate (3 mg/kg), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, or diphenhydramine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg), a histamine-H(1) receptor antagonist. MEA-induced bronchoconstriction was not enhanced by premedication with an intravenous injection of neostigmine (0.1 mg/kg), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. When bronchoconstriction was induced by MEA, histamine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were not significantly greater than in BALF after KOH-induced bronchoconstriction or in BALF after inhalation of physiologic saline. In vitro, contraction of trachea denuded of epithelium during superfusion with MEA (10 mm) was suppressed by premedication with pyrilamine maleate, a histamine-H(1) receptor antagonist, at 10 and 100 microm. Contraction of trachea denuded of epithelium during superfusion with MEA (10 mm) was suppressed by premedication with atropine sulfate at 10 and 100 microm. These results suggest that asthma-like symptoms may result partly from agonistic MEA effects at histamine-H(1) receptors and muscarinic receptors."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2-aminoethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Adsorption can be affected by the acidity of the soil(SRC). The pKa of 2-aminoethanol is 9.5(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."

The free EA-base demonstrated rapid absorption and translocation, with preferential migration to the tillers, resulting in a uniform distribution of radioactivity in aboveground plant parts. In contrast, the protonated form, EA-HCl, exhibited reduced uptake and restricted mobility, mainly retained in the main shoot. Despite analogous metabolism, compensatory translocation differences were observed during ontogenesis, leading to similar distribution patterns at maturity, where kernels acted as a significant sink. Detailed studies suggested mainly apical transport, with radioactivity declining in roots and leaves below the application site while actively growing parts, particularly the ears, became notable sinks. Notably, EA exhibited distinct mobility from its main metabolites (CC, GB), suggesting its involvement in the conversion to volatile compounds. Contradictory results were observed with the protonated EA, showcasing a slower decline in radioactivity, lower translocation to tillers initially, and a distribution pattern resembling that of EA at maturity. These findings provide insights into the differential translocation and absorption dynamics of Monoethanolamine in spring barley plants.",
