    "Description": "Anthranilic acid is an aminobenzoic acid that is benzoic acid having a single amino substituent located at position 2. It is a metabolite produced in L-tryptophan-kynurenine pathway in the central nervous system. It has a role as a mouse metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an anthranilate.",

Anthranilic acid degraded 81% in a 5 day BOD test using sewage at 20 \u00b0C(6). Anthranilic acid degraded 97.5% by COD removal in 5 days after 20 days acclimation of activated sludge(7). A 5 day BOD test gave 62.7% biodegradation of anthranilic acid in Songhua River water collected from Jilin Province, China(8).

Anthranilic acid, at a concentration of 1370 ppm, was actively generating CO2 and methane after 60 days in a saltmarsh sediment sample incubated at 25 \u00b0C(3). Anthranilic acid was degraded 100% in one week in anaerobic digester sludge(4). Anthranilic acid was anaerobically biodegraded 100% in 90 days in 2 mesophilic sludges; cattle sludge, 72 day lag, and shell sludge, 60 day lag(5). Anthranilic acid was not biodegraded after 120 days in a thermophilic sludge(5). Less than 1% of the anthranilic acid remained in sulfate reducing and methanogenic aquifer slurries after 8 months(6). Anthranilic acid was degraded anaerobically in a shell sludge at a rate of 8.1 mg/g-day with 101% methane production after a 23 day lag period(7). Anthranilic acid was also degraded anaerobically in a shell sludge, adapted with 2-nitrophenol for 200 days, at a rate of 11.7 mg/g-day with 96% methane production after a 25 day lag period(7)."

            "Value": "The Koc of anthranilic acid is estimated as 110(SRC), using a log Kow of 1.21(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that anthranilic acid is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of anthranilic acid is 2.14(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5)."
