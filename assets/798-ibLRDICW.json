Indole, in a 5 day BOD test, reached 49.5% of the theoretical BOD using a mixed microbial inoculum obtained from an enrichment culture(2). A 5 day BOD test gave a BOD of 2.07 g/g for indole using a sewage inoculum(3). First order biodegradation rate constants of 4.3X10-2 BOD/hr and 7.7X10-2 spec/hr were measured for indole at 1.6, 2.5, and 3.2 mg/l for a BOD and a UV spectrophotometry detection method, respectively; the inoculum used was a mixed culture obtained from an enrichment culture technique(3). A reaction pathway for the aerobic biodegradation of indole was proposed: indole to indoxyl to dihydroxyindole to isatin to formylanthranilic acid to anthranilic acid to catechol(5). Indole, added to Chernozem soil at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 g/kg soil, was completely biodegraded in 19, 37, 62, 72, 84, 92, 102, 131, and 135 days, respectively(6)."

            "Value": "Indole was completely biodegraded in 10 days under methanogenic conditions using a 9% anaerobic sewage sludge inoculum forming oxindole as an intermediate metabolite; the concn of indole in the sterile control over this time remained unchanged(1). Throughout the incubation period, net methane production increased, indicating that indole was mineralized(1). Complete metabolism of indole by methanogenic sediments from the shore, edge, and bottom of Buffalo Run stream, PA, occurred within 33 days. As indole disappeared, stoichiometric amounts of oxindole appeared in the sediment suspensions and persisted for over 4 weeks and was completely eliminated over 110 days(2). Complete biodegradation of indole was reported in 24 days using a 9% digested sludge inoculum at 22 \u00b0C under methanogenic conditions(2). Indole was completely biodegraded by suspensions of an organic soil (Carlisle muck) under methanogenic conditions within 67 days; concurrently, oxindole appeared, and persisted in near stoichiometric amounts for about 3 weeks(2). No oxindole accumulated under denitrifying conditions, using a soil inoculum, during the 144 days which were required for indole to disappear(2). This pattern was again seen using a 9% sewage sludge inoculum under methanogenic and denitrifying conditions; both conditions required 7 days for complete disappearance of indole; however, oxindole accumulated temporarily in the methanogenic culture but was not seen in the denitrifying culture probably due to rapid metabolism of this compound(2)."

Female CD-1 mice were admin 5 u mol/kg coumarin, trimethylene oxide (TMO), or trimethylene sulfide (TMS) for 6 days by gavage, or benzofuran, indole, or indole-3-carbinol (IC) daily for 10 days.

All cmpd except indole, significantly enhanced epoxide hydrolase activity. GST activities were elevated by all cmpd except TMO and TMS. NADH/QR activity was incr only by coumarin and benzofuran. Indole incr only GST, UDPGDH and cyt-c-red activities. IC enhanced GST, UDPGDH, cyt-c-red, epoxide hydrolase and cytochrome p450 and related monooxygenase activities. Benzofuran and coumarin showed more varied responses. Both cmpd incr epoxide hydrolase, GST and NADH/QR activities. Benzofuran decr cytochrome p450 content and elevated ECOD activity."

            "Value": "To ascertain whether the bladder mass incr and epithelial hyperplasia induced by 5% dietary sodium saccharin in short term experiments with rats are caused by incr urinary excretion of indican associated with this treatment, the responses of the urine and bladder induced by 1.5% indole ingestion were compared with those induced by %5 sodium saccharin and 1.5% indole. Indole and sodium saccharin, when fed alone, produced equivalent incr in bladder mass and both compounds induced epithelial hyperplasia, but indole ingestion was associated with much greater urinary indican excretion (5 mg/kg diet ingested) than sodium saccharin (0.3 mg/g diet ingested). When indole and sodium saccharin were ingested together, the bladder mass incr was additive, but with each alone, the urinary indican was equivalent to that produced by indole alone. These findings /indicate/ that a high level of urinary indican excretion is associated with an incr in bladder mass and epithelial hyperplasia (indole treatment) but indicate that the relatively low urinary indican level obtained by the sodium saccharin feeding alone is unlikely to be responsible for the bladder responses noted in this cmpd."
