            "content": "Aminopyralid is a new auxinic herbicide that provides Canada thistle control at lower use rates than clopyralid. Studies were conducted to determine if differences in absorption, translocation, or metabolism account for aminopyralid\u2019s greater biological activity. Radiolabeled aminopyralid and clopyralid were applied to individual leaves of rosette-stage Canada thistle plants. Nonionic surfactant was used for the absorption studies because it provided higher aminopyralid absorption than methylated seed oil or crop oil concentrate. Clopyralid was absorbed very rapidly, reaching 72% 24 h after treatment (HAT) and remaining near or above 80% during a 192-h time course. During the same time period, aminopyralid absorption increased from 34 to 60%. Clopyralid translocation out of the treated leaf was significantly higher than aminopyralid, 39% compared with 17%, respectively, 192 HAT. More of applied clopyralid translocated to aboveground tissue 192 HAT (27%) than to roots (12%), whereas aminopyralid translocation was similar in aboveground tissue (10%) and roots (7%) 192 HAT. Neither aminopyralid nor clopyralid was metabolized 192 HAT. Although aminopyralid is effective at lower use rates than clopyralid, clopyralid absorption and translocation were higher in Canada thistle. These results suggest that aminopyralid\u2019s chemical structure may provide for greater biological activity at the target site than clopyralid.",

Within 24 h, more than 97% of the radioactivity from picloram or clopyralid was absorbed by the foliage of both plant species. Acropetal transport of both herbicides was similar in the two plant species, with approximately 60% or more of the recovered radioactivity from picloram and clopyralid treatments moving acropetally out of the treated leaf 144 h after application. Less than 6% of the 14C-label from either herbicide treatment moved basipetally in both species. Therefore, differences in absorption and translocation did not account for intra- or inter-species sensitivity differences to the two herbicides. Significantly more 14C-picloram and 14C-clopyralid was converted to water-soluble metabolites in rapeseed than in sunflower plants. However, in rapeseed plants, the pattern of metabolism of both herbicides was similar, indicating that the difference between the metabolism of picloram and clopyralid did not account for the sensitivity difference within this species. It appears that only one picloram and clopyralid metabolite was formed in both plant species as determined by TLC. The metabolite of picloram or clopyralid was a water-soluble conjugate that yielded the carboxylic acid amide of the respective herbicide upon ammonolysis.\n",
