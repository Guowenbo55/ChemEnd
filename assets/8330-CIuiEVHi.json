    "Description": "Tecnazene is a C-nitro compound that is nitrobenzene in which the four hydrogens located ortho- and para- to the nitro group have been replaced by chlorines. A fungicide used to control dry rot, it is no longer approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a C-nitro compound, a tetrachlorobenzene and an aromatic fungicide. It is functionally related to a 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene.",

The major product for anaerobic biodegradation of tecnazene is 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroaniline(1). The redox potential of the anaerobic system was important in determining how the degradation of tecnazene proceeds(1). It was reported that tecnazene biodegradation did not proceed if the redox potential decreased below -0.38 volts relative to an SCE electrode(1)."
