Initial concentrations of Na2HAsO4 resulted in moderate initial water-soluble arsenic levels, with roots having an initial concentration of 211 \u00b1 3.3 mg As kg\u22121 and fronds with 6.0 mg As kg\u22121. However, over time, this form of arsenic demonstrated a substantial increase in both root and frond arsenic concentrations. The mature fronds particularly showed a significant concentration of 1653 \u00b1 4 mg As kg\u22121, resulting in a notable translocation factor (TF) of 7.9. Moreover, the bioconcentration factor (BF) for fronds was also high (BF = 32.8), indicating substantial arsenic accumulation in fronds relative to soil concentrations. This suggests an efficient uptake and accumulation of arsenic from Na2HAsO4-contaminated soil by ladder brake plants.",
