The majority of alpha cells were degranulated with nuclei surrounded by a colorless cytoplasm. When animals were allowed to recover after the last injection, islands returned to normal. Injections of colloidal cobalt produced a slight increase in number of endocrine islands. Alpha and beta cells were normal in size. After six daily injections, the pancreas showed a definite increase in number and size of islands. The author concludes that  cobalt-nitrate is identical in action to cobaltous-chloride but is far less toxic than  cobaltous-chloride."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Neurotoxicity/ Several rodent studies have identified neurological effects following cobalt exposure. In Wistar rats, a single gavage dose of 4.25 mg cobalt/kg as cobalt chloride resulted in a moderate reduction in spontaneous activity, muscle tone, touch response, and respiration, while 19.4 mg cobalt/kg as cobalt sulfate caused a mild reduction the same parameters. In rats exposed to 4.96 mg cobalt/kg/day as cobalt chloride for 30 days in the drinking water, cobalt led to changes in sympathetically mediated contractile activity of isolated rat vas deferens. Rats exposed to 6.44 mg cobalt/kg/day as cobalt nitrate in the drinking water showed an increased sensitivity and decreased maximal response to a cholinergic agonist. In rats exposed to 20 mg cobalt/kg/day as cobalt chloride for 57 days in the drinking water, cobalt enhanced behavioral reactivity to stress (the animals were less likely to descend from a safe platform to an electrified grid). Rats exposed to the same dose in the diet for 69 days showed a slower rate of lever pressing than controls, but no change in behavioral reactivity to stress. Longer-term exposure of rats to cobalt chloride (7 months) resulted in a significant increase in the latent reflex period at 0.5 mg cobalt/kg /and greater/ as cobalt chloride and a pronounced neurotropic effect (disturbed conditioned reflexes) at 2.5 mg cobalt/kg."
