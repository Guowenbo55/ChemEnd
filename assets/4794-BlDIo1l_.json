The rate of glufosinate required to reduce shoot dry weight by 50% (GR50) varied between weed species. GR50 values for giant foxtail, barnyardgrass, velvetleaf, and common lambsquarters were 69, 186, 199, and 235 g ai ha\u22121, respectively. Absorption of 14C-glufosinate increased with time and reached a plateau 24 hours after treatment (HAT). Absorption of 14C-glufosinate was 67, 53, 42, and 16% for giant foxtail, barnyardgrass, velvetleaf, and common lambsquarters, respectively. Translocation of absorbed 14C-glufosinate from the treated leaf was greatest for giant foxtail and barnyardgrass (15 and 14% 24 HAT of absorbed 14C-glufosinate, respectively). This compared to 5 and < 1% for translocation of absorbed 14C-glufosinate from the treated leaves of velvetleaf and common lambsquarters. The majority of 14C-glufosinate translocated by giant foxtail and barnyardgrass was found below the treated leaf and in the roots, indicating phloem mobility of the herbicide. Differential absorption and translocation of 14C-glufosinate may be contributing factors to the differential sensitivity observed between weed species.",

Young seedlings of Setaria faberi, Chenopodium album, Cassia obtusifolia, Solanum carolinense, and Asclepias syriaca were treated with foliar-applied 14C-glufosinate, and plant tissues were harvested 12, 48, and 72 h after treatment (HAT). Absorption of 14C-glufosinate was initially rapid, but increased only slightly after 12 h in all species. Glufosinate absorption was highest in S. carolinense (73% of applied radioactivity), followed by S. faberi (54%), C. obtusifolia (44%), C. album (41%), and A. syriaca (37%) 72 HAT. Translocation of radioactivity out of the treated leaf was species dependent and did not increase much with time in all weed species. S. carolinense and S. faberi translocated the highest amounts of absorbed radioactivity out of the treated leaf with 49 to 59% moving to the upper foliage. S. faberi translocated the highest amount of absorbed radioactivity to the roots (12 to 14%), while C. album translocated the least (2 to 3%). TLC analysis of plant extracts showed that 14C-glufosinate was not metabolized in S. faberi, C. obtusifolia, S. carolinense, and A. syriaca. A glufosinate metabolite with an Rf value matching that of methyl-phosphinico propionate was detected in C. album. Treatment with ammonium sulfate (AMS) increased glufosinate absorption in S. faberi and C. obtusifolia 12 HAT, but decreased absorption in C. album. Treatment with pelargonic acid (PA) did not affect glufosinate absorption in any of the species tested. Treatment with AMS and PA did not affect glufosinate translocation in any of the five weed species. Treatment with AMS and PA did not influence the metabolism of glufosinate in any of the five weed species studied. These results show that differential absorption and translocation seem to explain the greater sensitivity of the annual and perennial weeds to glufosinate. Treatment with ammonium sulfate may increase the efficacy of glufosinate in perennial weeds.",
