Moench \u2018RS6\u201312\u2032], barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. \u2018Dare\u2019], and Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.) were determined after treatment with 14C-labeled herbicides in nutrient solution for 24 hr at 16 or 38 C. 14C-profluralin accumulated in roots to a greater extent at 16 C, while metabolism was greatest at 38 C. Very little 14C-profluralin was translocated to the tops of plants. Conversely, 14C-dinitramine accumulated in the tops of plants to a greater extent at 38 C. Metabolism was not greatly affected by temperature. These effects may relate to excess toxicity of profluralin at 16 C and dinitramine at 38 C in species which normally exhibit resistance to the herbicides.",

They were grown under controlled conditions with 14 hr, 15 klux, 32\u00b0C days and 10 hr, 27\u00b0C nights. For absorption and translocation studies, sorghum and soybean seeds were germinated in moist paper rolls, and palmer amaranth and barnyardgrass seeds were germinated in Perlite. Plants were then transplanted to aerated, half-strength Hoagland's solution in green glass jars under controlled growth chamber conditions with 14 hr, 19.4 klux, 32\u00b0C days and 10 hr, 27\u00b0C nights.",

After planting, the cups were maintained with half-strength Hoagland's solution daily. Herbicidal response was measured by harvesting aerial parts of the plants and recording dry weight. 14C-radiolabeled profluralin (specific activity 34.3 \u00b5Ci/mg) was used for absorption and translocation studies.",

Four replications of each species at each temperature were used in a randomized block design for absorption and translocation studies. The experiments were repeated twice."
