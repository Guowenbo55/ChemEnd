            "Value": "... In this study, /the authors/ characterized the adducts formed in human globin upon treatment with 100-fold molar excess of MIC. The globin was subject to enzymatic hydrolysis with pronase, and the hydrolysate was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography with positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometric detection (HPLC/APCI-MS). The two major MIC adducts were those with N-terminal Val and side-chain of Lys, as confirmed by comparison with the synthetic standards. About 20 other adducts were observed, and several of them were tentatively identified using their MS and MS/MS spectra. Whereas detection of the adducts with Tyr and His was expected, the adducts with Trp and Phe, and a Lys adduct containing two MIC moieties, were probably analytical artifacts resulting from the transcarbamoylation during globin hydrolysis rather than products of direct carbamoylation. The other detected products were MIC-Val-His, derived from the N-terminal dipeptide of globin beta-chain, and dipeptides consisting of MIC-Lys attached to Gly, Val, Leu, Thr, and Glu. Failure to detect the corresponding non-modified dipeptides suggests that the pronase action may be hampered by the amino acid modification. MIC is known as a metabolic intermediate of the industrial solvents N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methylformamide (MF) in humans and rats. The HPLC/APCI-MS analysis of globin from rats injected with DMF or MF, 1000 mg/kg, revealed the presence of the MIC adducts with both Val and Lys. The level of the Val adduct in globin from the DMF-dosed rats, determined using Edman degradation and GC/MS, was ca. 40 nmol/g, which is a level common in workers occupationally exposed to DMF. This suggests that also the Lys adduct in such human globin samples can be feasible to analysis and is therefore considered for further studies as a potential biomarker of exposure to DMF."

Addition of MIC in vitro resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase, Mg(2+)-ATPase and K(+)-activated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase (K(+)-PNPPase). Activation of Na+, K(+)-ATPase by ATP in the presence of MIC showed a decrease in Vmax with no change in Km. Similarly, activation of K+ PNPPase by PNPP in the presence of MIC showed a decrease in Vmax with no change in Km. The circular dichroism spectral studies revealed that MIC interaction with Na+, K(+)-ATPase led to a conformation of the protein wherein the substrates Na+ and K+ were no longer able to bind at the Na(+)- and K(+)-activation sites. The data suggest that the inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase was non-competitive and occurred by interference with the dephosphorylation of the enzyme-phosphoryl complex."

MIC administration at 1.0 LD50 dose also resulted in significant increases in malondialdehyde and ferrous ion concentration in liver mitochondria. It is suggested that the augmented lipid peroxidation in hepatic mitochondria, catalyzed by iron, possibly mobilized from intracellular stores leads to the inhibition of enzymes of mitochondrial respiration at complex I region, in vivo, in rats receiving a lethal dose of MIC subcutaneously."

Lesions of the nasal cavity of rats and mice were characterized by regeneration of the olfactory and respiratory epithelium. By day 28, the respiratory epithelium of rats and mice appeared normal, but olfactory regeneration was still present in the surviving rats. Severe lesions of the trachea extending to the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli were seen in rats exposed to 3 ppm. Acute inflammation of the airways and hyaline membranes was observed in high dose animals killed on day 7. In 3 ppm MIC exposed animals that died during days 8 to 14,  there was lymphatic necrosis of the thymus, atrophy of the splenic white pulp, coagulative necrosis of the liver, and thrombosis of the left cardiac atrium. Gross examination of exposed mice showed minimal differences between exposure groups. Microscopic observations showed treatment related changes only in the 3 ppm exposure group of mice. The changes involved primarily the bronchial system and were not as severe as those observed in rats. By day 91, bronchial fibrosis was minimal to mild in mice.

A marginal increase in serum glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase levels and a significant increase in alkaline-phosphatase indicated mild liver parenchymal injury, and bile duct epithelial injury, respectively.  Histopathology showed progressive damage to sinusoids and necrosis at some foci.  At 72 hr the Kupffer cells became hyperactive.

One year after a single exposure to MIC these animals presented a condition best described as chronic obstructive lung disease. Using flow-volume measurements during air breathing and during CO2 challenge, animals surviving at 19 or 37 ppm presented typical abnormalities associated with airflow limitation along the conducting airways. One year after exposure lung hyperinflation was also present. At this time the poor ventilatory response to CO2 was due to mechanical limitation of lung expansion during inspiration and airflow limitation during expiration. The findings were similar to humans with severe obstructive lung disease. Microscopic examination substantiated the flow-volume measurements in that the main bronchi, small bronchi, and bronchioles were found to have an increase in dense fibrous tissue, while the alveolar level was characterized by destruction of alveolar walls and an increase in septal thickness.

Sequential matings of treated males with normal females on days 1-7, 8-14 and 15-21 post-exposure did not indicate any induction of dominant lethal mutation (increased frequency of preimplantation losses and early fetal deaths) by MIC but it was significantly induced by EMS as compared to respective controls. Males, necropsied after 21 days of exposure, showed no effect of MIC on epididymal sperm density and morphology. EMS also had no effect on sperm density but it significantly induced morphological abnormalities in sperm as compared to untreated controls. There was an acute and transitional reduction in reproductive performance (10-21%) of MIC-exposed males during days 1-14 post-exposure followed by recovery to the normal level during days 15-21 post-exposure.

The oxidation of NAD(+)-linked substrates (glutamate + malate) was more sensitive (fourfold) to the inhibitory action of MIC than succinate while cytochrome oxidase was unaffected.

As both the malondialdehyde and iron contents of brain mitochondria were not altered, it may be inferred that the observed in vivo inhibition of state 3 oxidation is induced by MIC through systemic stagnant hypoxia leading to ischemia of brain, which further contributes to the cerebral hypoxia."
