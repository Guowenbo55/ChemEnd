            "content": "The study examined the translocation and degradation kinetics of prothioconazole and tebuconazole, two fungicides effective against Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat. In greenhouse experiments, minimal translocation of the fungicides (<1%) was observed from flag leaves to ears and a maximum of 3.55% from ears to flag leaves. Field experiments showed that degradation kinetics were faster in flag leaf blades than in ears, with varying rates depending on cultivar. Despite differences in degradation rates, both fungicides resulted in significant decreases (42.6\u2013100%) in FHB traits. The findings suggest that while there is limited translocation of these fungicides, moderate redistribution in the ears occurs, which can be crucial for FHB management. Cultivar and environmental factors also influenced degradation kinetics, but overall, effective protection against FHB was maintained.",
