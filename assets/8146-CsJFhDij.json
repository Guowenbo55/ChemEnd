After a 16 day acclimation period a 39.8% BODT was recorded using an 8 hr Warburg test(5). A 5 day BOD test at 20 \u00b0C showed a 34.3% loss after 16 days of acclimation(5). A second 5 day BOD test, utilizing an adapted seed inoculum exhibited a 30% BODT(1). Incubation of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether for 5, 10, and 20 days without an acclimation period resulted in BOD values, measured in % theoretical, of 5, 31, and 48, respectively(2). Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, inoculated with wastewater, was bio-oxidized 17, 71, 75, and 87% following 5, 10, 15, and 20 days incubation, respectively; in seawater, this compound was bio-oxidized 11, 44, 57, and 70% in 5, 10, 15, and 20 days, respectively(3). According to the Zahn-Wellens screening method >90% loss of 400 ppm occurred in 28 days(4).

            "Value": "The Koc of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is estimated as 12(SRC), using a log Kow of -0.54(1) and a regression-derived equation(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility in soil."
