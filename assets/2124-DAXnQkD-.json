            "Value": "Aluminum fluoride (AlF4-) inhibited guanine nucleotide-activated phospholipase D (PLD) in rat submandibular gland cell-free lysates in a concentration-dependent response. This effect was consistent in permeabilized cells with endogenous phospholipid PLD substrates. Inhibition was not caused by either fluoride or aluminum alone and was reversed by aluminum chelation. Inhibition of PLD by aluminum fluoride was not mediated by cAMP, phosphatases 1, 2A or 2B, or phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. AlF4- had a similar inhibitory effect on rArf-stimulated PLD, but did not block the translocation of Arf from cytosol to membranes, indicating a post-GTP-binding-protein site of action. Oleate-sensitive PLD, which is not guanine nucleotide-dependent, was also inhibited by AlF4-, supporting a G protein-independent mechanism of action. A submandibular Golgi-enriched membrane preparation had high PLD activity which was also potently inhibited by AlF4-, leading to speculation that the known fluoride inhibition of Golgi vesicle transport may be PLD-mediated."

Eight rats were equally divided between a normoxic control group and a treatment group (exposure to chronic hypoxia, 10.5% O2, on day 19 and maintained until day 21 of gestation). On day 21, multiple myometrial strips were collected from each animal and mounted in a standard muscle bath preparation in Krebs buffer at 37 \u00b0C. Following equilibration, tissues were exposed to increasing doses of AlF4- (0.5 mM to 6 mM). Contractile tensions were analyzed by on-line computer, and data were normalized to cross-sectional area. Emax values did not differ between the two groups (160+/-15 vs. 168+/-7 for control and hypoxic groups, respectively, p>0.05). The slopes of the dose response curves and pD2 were also unaffected. Myometrial tissues from both normoxic and hypoxic rats showed similar efficacy and sensitivity to AlF4-."

AlF and NaF produced large increases in stress (force/muscle cross-sectional area), but temporal changes were dissimilar, as were other indices of muscle activation. Stress produced by NaF developed slowly and only after a long delay of about 15 min, whereas stress produced by AlF developed rapidly after a delay of only about 5 min. NaF-induced contractions were more sustained than AlF-induced contractions. Both AlF and NaF increased the level of cross-bridge phosphorylation and the velocity of muscle shortening, but at comparable stresses, AlF produced greater increases than did NaF. AlF produced a large increase in lP production, whereas NaF produced a small increase. Also, AlF-induced stress was largely insensitive to inhibition by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 uM), whereas NaF-induced stress was largely inhibited by nifedipine. However, in tissues depleted of calcium, both agents produced potent contractions when CaCl2 was added back to the tissues (EC50 values for AlF, NaF, histamine, phenylephrine and KCl were, respectively, 0.057, 0.085, 0.11, 0.11 and 0.23 mM). AlF, but not NaF, strongly desensitized arteries to phenylephrine, causing a 73% reduction in the ability of phenylephrine to achieve maximum steady-state stress."

General decline of bodily appearance was observed in the lowest concentration AlF3 group, and animals in this group succumbed in greater numbers during the course of the study than those in any other group. Examinations of performance in an open field, an analysis of walking patterns, and a balance beam test did not find any difficulties indicative of motor disorder. Indeed, on the initial trial on the balance beam, the AlF3-treated animals exhibited superior performance. No group differences were found in behavior assessed by spontaneous alternation or by a modified Morris water maze test. When retested in the Morris maze after a low dose of scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg), the control animals took longer to reach the platform while the AlF3-treated rats were not affected. In an olfactory preference test, the AlF3-treated animals failed to show preferences exhibited by the controls, indicating a possible olfactory impairment. The level of Al in the brains of the AlF3-exposed rats, as determined by direct current plasma analysis, was almost double that of the control animals. There was a similar trend for the Al content found in the kidneys."
