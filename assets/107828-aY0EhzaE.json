    "Description": "Bensulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is urea in which a hydrogen attached to one of the nitrogens has been replaced by an (o-carboxybenzyl)sulfonyl group, while a hydrogen attached to the other nitrogen has been replaced by a 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl group. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used (particularly as its methyl ester, bensulfuron-methyl) as a herbicide for the control of a variety of both annual and perennial weeds in crops, particularly wheat and rice. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea, an aromatic ether, a member of pyrimidines and a member of benzoic acids.",

It was found that rice absorbed a greater amount of bensulfuron compared to Cyperus serotinus. The translocation rates of bensulfuron from roots to shoots were much faster in Cyperus serotinus than in rice plants. Rice plants exhibited a very fast metabolic rate of bensulfuron, while Cyperus serotinus showed a slower metabolic rate. Consequently, after 12 hours of absorption, a greater amount of parent bensulfuron remained in the shoots of Cyperus serotinus compared to rice. These findings suggest that Cyperus serotinus is susceptible to bensulfuron due to its slower metabolic rate and fast translocation rate, while the tolerance of rice may be attributed to its faster metabolic rate.",

            "content": "Absorption, translocation, and metabolism studies were conducted to investigate the selectivity and herbicidal action of *C-bensulfuron in two rice cultivars and three paddy weeds at different temperatures. The results showed that absorption of *C-bensulfuron was greater at 30/25\u00b0C compared to 25/20\u00b0C, with cv. Sangpung exhibiting higher absorption than cv. Samgang. Among the paddy weeds, Cyperus serotinus and Sagittaria pygmaea showed greater absorption than Echinochloa crus-galli. Similarly, the translocation rate of bensulfuron was higher at 30/25\u00b0C than at 25/20\u00b0C, and cv. Sangpung exhibited higher translocation rate compared to cv. Samgang. Among the paddy weeds, Cyperus serotinus showed the highest translocation rate, followed by Sagittaria pygmaea and Echinochloa crus-galli. In terms of metabolism, the concentration of the parent compound in rice plants was greater in cv. Sangpung, which was susceptible to bensulfuron, compared to cv. Samgang. Additionally, a higher amount of the parent compound was distributed in the shoots and roots of Cyperus serotinus and Sagittaria pygmaea compared to Echinochloa crus-galli. These findings suggest that the sensitivity of rice cultivars to bensulfuron may be attributed to differences in inactivation metabolic ability, and the phytotoxicity of rice increased at high temperatures due to higher absorption. Furthermore, the higher herbicidal activity of bensulfuron in the three weed species at high temperatures may be associated with increased absorption and translocation.",
