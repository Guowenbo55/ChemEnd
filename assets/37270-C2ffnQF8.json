Both isomers of heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were detected in samples of American lobster (Homarus americanus) digestive glands collected in May 1983 and May 1984 from 3 of 5 sites in maritime Canada; lobsters tissue from Miramachi Bay and Limestone Point, New Brunswick and the South Arm of Sydney Harbor, Nova Scotia contained concn (avg of duplicate analyses) of 14, 4, and 9 pg/g (wet weight basis) of the two isomers of heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin(2). The two sites where no heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin residues were detected in the lobster tissue were the mouth of Sydney Harbor and Port Morien, Nova Scotia(2). The three sites where these isomers were detected in the lobster tissues were known to receive effluents from industry(2). The concn of total heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin found in blue mussels (Mitilus edulus) from coastal Japan in the Osaka area were as follows: Misaki-Cho, 8.9-40 parts/trillion, (avg 20 parts/trillion) and Hokko, 11-37 parts/trillion (22 parts/trillion avg); in the Hokaido area one sample from Funka Bay contained 6.0 parts/trillion and samples from Risheri Island did not contain detectable concn (detection limit 1 parts/trillion)(3)."
