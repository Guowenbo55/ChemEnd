    "Description": "Chlorphenamine is a tertiary amino compound that is propylamine which is substituted at position 3 by a pyridin-2-yl group and a p-chlorophenyl group and in which the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen are replaced by methyl groups. A histamine H1 antagonist, it is used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever, rhinitis, urticaria, and asthma. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an antipruritic drug, a histamine antagonist, a serotonin uptake inhibitor, an antidepressant and an anti-allergic agent. It is a tertiary amino compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a member of pyridines.",

            "Value": "Antihistamines used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. They thereby prevent, but do not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Antihistamines antagonize, in varying degrees, most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus. Also, the anticholinergic actions of most antihistamines provide a drying effect on the nasal mucosa. /Antihistamines/"

            "Value": "Within the vascular tree, the H1 antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor effects of histamine and, to a degree, the more rapid vasodilator effects that are mediated by H1 receptors on endothelial cells. Residual vasodilatation reflects the involvement of H2 receptors on smooth muscle and can be suppressed only by the concurrent administration of an H2 antagonist. Effects of the histamine antagonists on histamine induced changes in systemic blood pressure parallel these vascular effects. /Histamine Antagonists: H1 Antagonists/"
