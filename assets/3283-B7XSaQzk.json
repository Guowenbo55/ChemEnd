Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(1). The 5-day biological oxygen demand measured for diethyl ether in screening tests ranged from 0%(2,3) to approximately 1.1%(2) in studies using the standard dilution technique with sewage inocula and 0% in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum(4). A lag time of >10 days was observed in the latter study with activated sludge(4). In a study which used the seawater dilution method with a sewage inoculum, 0% theoretical BOD was observed over a 5-day period(3). No change was observed in the biological oxygen demand in tests of a semi-continuous activated sludge biological treatment simulator which tested for the removal of diethyl ether at a concn of 200 to 800 ppm in a domestic sewage feed over a period of 24 hours(5). A biodegradation study of diethyl ether, based on TOC measurements (GC analysis), using an activated sludge seed and an initial diethyl ether concn of 100 mg/L, indicated 2.5% (6.5%) biodegradation over a period of 4 weeks(6)."

            "Value": "The mechanism of action by which .... ethyl ether produce/s/ reversible loss of consciousness is still unclear. Anesthesia can be produced  by a wide variety of chemical agents, ranging from inert rare gases to steriodal molecules. This apparent lack of specificity, together with the observation that general anesthesia can be reversed by high pressure, poses a unique pharmacological problem. Most theories concern interaction of anesthetics with either membrane lipids or hydrophobic regions of specificic membrane-bound proteins. One hypothesis is that the anesthetic changes the function of an ion channel protein by modifying the conformation of the protein. Some investigators suggest that the GABA receptor may be the ion channel protein that is affected by inhalation of anesthetic agents... The most appropriate concept for the mechanism of general anesthesia /may be/ a the heterogenous site of anesthetic action, including both lipid and protein membrane components linked with neuronal function."

Consequently, ether blocks sensory pathways to the cortex; the blockade occurs even before cortical activity is entirely suspended. In contrast, pentobarbital suppresses activity in the cortex without blocking the sensory path to it during sciatic nerve stimulation."

The effects of an inhalatory anesthetic (ethyl ether) during the neonatal period of brain sexual differentiation on the later fertility and sexual behavior of male rats /were investigated/. Animals were exposed to ethyl ether immediately after birth. At adulthood, body weight, testes wet weight, and plasma testosterone levels were not affected; however, neonatal exposure to ether showed alterations on male fertility: a decrease in the number of spermatids and spermatozoa, an increase in the transit time of cauda epididymal spermatozoa and a decrease in daily sperm production. An alteration of sexual behavior was also observed: decreased male sexual behavior and appearance of homosexual behavior when the male rats were castrated and pretreated with exogenous estrogen. ..."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Cardiovascular System. Anesthetic concentrations of ether have little effect upon the heart. In this respect it has a great advantage over halogenated anesthetics because there is little danger of inducing ventricular fibrillation. Heart rate and blood pressure are increased during the excitement of induction, primarily from release of epinephrine from increased sympathetic nervous activity. There are occasional varied arrhythmias generally occurring during induction. Cardiac output during light surgical anesthesia is increased by about 20%. Increase in cardiac output probably accounts for maintenance of blood pressure at this relatively high level. Deep surgical anesthesia causes a progressive fall in blood pressure as a result of a drop in cardiac output and progressive depression of the vasomotor centers with peripheral vasodilation. Cardiac output drops from depression of cardiac contractility. However, it is less for ether than for other inhalant anesthetics. At the termination of Stage III, respiration ceases but the heart continues to beat. The circulation is inadequate because the peripheral vasodilation permits blood to remain in blood vessels instead of returning it to the heart in proper supply. Thus the underoxygenated myocardium ceases to beat, and death from hypoxia and asphyxiation occurs. There are evidences of hemoconcentration during ether anesthesia (ie, reduction in plasma volume and increases in cell volume, hemoglobin, and red cell counts). Production of platelets is probably unaffected by ether as well as by most other anesthetics."

With proper premedication, ether is the safest of all general anesthetics. Ether satisfactorily depresses the CNS without undesirable effects upon other systems of the body. It permits ready control of the level of anesthesia especially if used with oxygen, and provides good surgical anesthesia in the young pig, calf, dog, and cat.

To more fully characterize these effects, adult male NIH mice were exposed to a range of concentrations of ether (1000-30000 ppm) in an inhalation chamber and both behavioral and neuroendocrine response were assessed. When responding was maintained under FI-60 s schedules of milk presentation, 30-min exposures to 1000 ppm ether resulted in minimal behavioral effects, 3000-10000 ppm increased rates of responding over two-fold and higher concentrations decreased responding almost completely. Five-min exposures to the same range of concentrations resulted in concentration-related effects which were smaller than those produced by 30-min exposures. Exposure to a similar range of concentrations in naive mice increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Five-min exposures to 10000 ppm ether increased levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone from a baseline of 29.95 pg/mL to 310.5 pg/mL but did not affect corticosterone. Thirty-min exposures to the full range of concentrations of ether, increased corticosterone from control levels of 70 ng/mL to 418 ng/mL at 30000 ppm, and increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone from control levels of 19.13 pg/mL to 80.5 pg/mL at 30000 ppm, in a concentration-dependent manner. The increase in adrenocorticotrophic hormone for 30-min exposures was not as large as that observed for 5-min exposures at 10000 ppm, nor was it as large as that seen for corticosterone. The imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro 15-4513 decreased FI responding at doses greater than 3 mg/kg and attenuated the rate-increasing effects of diethyl ether at 1 mg/kg.
