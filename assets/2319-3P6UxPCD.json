    "Description": "Benfluralin is a tertiany amino compound that is 2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline in which the hydrogens attached to the aniline nitrogen have been replaced by one ethyl and one butyl group. It is used as a pre-emergence herbicide used for the control of grass and other weeds in a range of food and non-food crops. It has a role as a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a tertiary amino compound, a C-nitro compound, an organofluorine compound and a substituted aniline.",

Biodegradation of benfluralin in soil occurs via oxidative and reductive pathways(1). Oxidation classically occurs in aerobic soils and reduction in anaerobic soils. However, in flooded field soils, both oxidation and reduction products have been observed(1). In field soil, oxidative biodegradation of benfluralin leads to dealkylation products followed by reduction of nitro group to amino products(1,4). Rates of biodegradation of benfluralin is dependent on soil temperature and moisture content and the rate is faster at 30 \u00b0C compared to 4 \u00b0C, and in dry soil compared to water-saturated field soils(2-3). The biodegradation is faster in soils containing higher organic carbon contents(3,5). The biodegradation half-lives of benfluralin in a loam and a sandy loam soil were 0.7 month and 1.5 months, respectively, at 30 \u00b0C(3)."

Body weights were reduced over time (in males, primarily in last few weeks of the study), so that at termination the deficits of 2500 and 5000 ppm groups compared to controls were 8 and 17% in males, and 18 and 28% in females, respectively.

The majority of these rats had \"slight\" to \"minimal\" degeneration of sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle (thigh). Males had elevated incidence of single cell necrosis in liver. Chronic inflammation of the lungs was seen in the majority of these rats, whereas low incidences of congestion of the abdominal cavity, and urinary bladder hyperplasia were limited to these dose levels. Numerous clinical chemistry changes mirrored the above pathology in kidneys, liver, and perhaps other tissues at the higher two dose levels.

Hepatocellular tumors (primarily adenomas) were increased in males (incidences of 2, 2, 1, 5, and 11 in controls through high dose, respectively).
