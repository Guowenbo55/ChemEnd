            "Value": "Dichlorvos is the active molecule of the pro-drug metrifonate used to revert the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. A few years ago it was reported that dichlorvos inhibits the enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase at lower doses than those necessary to inhibit acetylcholinesterase to the same extent. Therefore, the aim of our investigation was to test the hypothesis that dichlorvos can enhance synaptic efficacy through a mechanism that involves acylpeptide hydrolase instead of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. We used long-term potentiation induced in rat hippocampal slices as a model of synaptic plasticity. Our results indicate that short-term exposures (20 min) to 50 uM dichlorvos enhance long-term potentiation in about 200% compared to the control condition. This effect is correlated with approximately 60% inhibition of acylpeptide hydrolase activity, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity remains unaffected. Paired-pulse facilitation and inhibition experiments indicate that dichlorvos does not have any presynaptic effect in the CA3-->CA1 pathway nor affect gabaergic interneurons. Interestingly, the application of 100 nM methyllicaconitine, an alpha(7) nicotinic receptor antagonist, blocked the enhancing effect of dichlorvos on long-term potentiation. These results indicate that under the exposure conditions described above, dichlorvos enhances long-term potentiation through a postsynaptic mechanism that involves (a) the inhibition of the enzyme acylpeptide hydrolase and (b) the modulation of alpha(7) nicotinic receptors."

            "Value": "Exposure to dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphorus pesticide, is known to result in neurotoxicity as well as other metabolic perturbations. However, the molecular causes of DDVP toxicity are poorly understood, especially in cells other than neurons and muscle cells. To obtain a better understanding of the process of non-neuronal DDVP toxicity, we exposed zebrafish to different concentrations of DDVP, and investigated the resulting changes in liver histology and gene transcription. Functional enrichment analysis of genes affected by DDVP exposure identified a number of processes involved in energy utilization and stress response in the liver. The abundance of transcripts for proteins involved in glucose metabolism was profoundly affected, suggesting that carbon flux might be diverted toward the pentose phosphate pathway to compensate for an elevated demand for energy and reducing equivalents for detoxification. Strikingly, many transcripts for molecules involved in beta-oxidation and fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated. We found increases in message levels for molecules involved in reactive oxygen species responses as well as ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. To ensure that the effects of DDVP on energy metabolism were not simply a consequence of poor feeding because of neuromuscular impairment, we fasted fish for 29 or 50 hr and analyzed liver gene expression in them. The patterns of gene expression for energy metabolism in fasted and DDVP-exposed fish were markedly different. We observed coordinated changes in the expression of a large number of genes involved in energy metabolism and responses to oxidative stress. These results argue that an appreciable part of the effect of DDVP is on energy metabolism and is regulated at the message level. Although we observed some evidence of neuromuscular impairment in exposed fish that may have resulted in reduced feeding, the alterations in gene expression in exposed fish cannot readily be explained by nutrient deprivation."

Among the glial cells, astrocytes in particular act as \"nurse cells\", regulating neuronal survival and functions. In the present study, to reveal whether a known neurotoxic substance, organophosphate dichlorvos (DDVP), affects the differentiation of astrocytes, we used an astrocyte differentiation model in rat glioma C6 cells. Morphological change and induction of GFAP expression in the differentiating C6 cells were suppressed by DDVP treatment. The known potential targets of DDVP are acetylcholine esterase (AChE), fatty acid amide hydrolase and methyl guanine methyl transferase. Among the specific inhibitors against these enzymes, the AChE inhibitor paraoxon successfully suppressed the cellular morphological changes and the induction of GFAP expression in differentiating C6 cells. These results indicate that DDVP inhibits differentiation in the C6 astrocyte-differentiation model, in which at least AChE inhibition is involved and that AChE is a potent regulator of the differentiation. Furthermore, considering that the main substrate of AChE is ACh, thus, ACh may act as regulators of astrocyte differentiation."

            "Value": "The toxicity of dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphate (OP) pesticide, classically results from modification of the serine in the active sites of cholinesterases. However, DDVP also forms adducts on unrelated targets such as transferrin and albumin, suggesting that DDVP could cause perturbations in cellular processes by modifying noncholinesterase targets. Here we identify novel DDVP-modified targets in lysed human hepatocyte-like cells (HepaRG) using a direct liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay of cell lysates incubated with DDVP or using a competitive pull-down experiments with a biotin-linked organophosphorus compound (10-fluoroethoxyphosphinyl-N-biotinamidopentyldecanamide; FP-biotin), which competes with DDVP for similar binding sites. We show that DDVP forms adducts to several proteins important for the cellular metabolic pathways and differentiation, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and actin. We validated the results using purified proteins and enzymatic assays. The study not only identified novel DDVP-modified targets but also suggested that the modification directly inhibits the enzymes. The current approach provides information for future hypothesis-based studies to understand the underlying mechanism of toxicity of DDVP in non-neuronal tissues.

            "Value": "The molecular mechanism(s) mediating long-term adverse effects of dichlorvos, a widely used insecticide, are still unclear. Our work uncovered a new cellular effect of dichlorvos in cultured human cells, i.e. its capacity to induce extremely aberrant mitotic spindles with monopolar microtubule arrays that were associated with hypercondensed chromosomes and pyknotic chromatin masses. Monopolar spindles produced by dichlorvos treatment were characterized by the delocalization of the depolymerizing kinesin Kif2a from spindle poles. Dichlorvos-induced spindle monopolarity could be reversed by promoting microtubule stabilization through chemical treatment or by inhibiting the depolymerizing function of the kinesin MCAK at kinetochores. These findings demonstrate that dichlorvos inhibits the depolymerizing activity of Kif2a at centrosomes and thereby disrupts the balance of opposing centrosomal and kinetochore forces controlling spindle bipolarity during prometaphase. Dichlorvos-induced defects in spindle bipolarity may be responsible for the previously reported induction of aneuploidy by this chemical. Collectively, these results indicate that environmental chemicals, such as dichlorvos, may promote chromosome instability by interfering with the cell division machinery."

Mitochondria, as a primary site of cellular energy generation and oxygen consumption represent itself a likely target for organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, the objective of the current study was planned with an aim to investigate the effect of chronic dichlorvos exposure on mitochondrial calcium uptake, oxidative stress generation and its implication in the induction of neuronal apoptosis in rodent model. Mitochondrial preparation from dichlorvos (DDVP) treated rat brain demonstrated significant increase in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake (644.2 nmol/mg protein). Our results indicated decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities of cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) along with altered mitochondrial complex I, and complex II activity, which might have resulted from elevated mitochondrial calcium uptake. The alterations in the mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial electron transfer enzyme activities in turn might have caused an increase in malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation as a result of enhanced lipid peroxidation, and as well as protein and mtDNA oxidation. All this could have been because of enhanced oxidative stress, decreased GSH levels and also decreased Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria isolated from dichlorvos treated rat brain. Thus, chronic organophosphate exposure has the potential to disrupt cellular antioxidant defense system which in turn triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol as well as caspase-3 activation in dichlorvos treated rat brain as revealed by immunoblotting experiments. Low-level long-term organophosphate exposure finally resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. These studies provide an evidence of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptotic neuronal degeneration after chronic low-level exposure to dichlorvos."

Rat plasma samples were collected at different time-points to measure the metabolomic profiles by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Liver tissue analysis was performed to correlate histopathological outcome status to plasma metabolomics.

Urinary metabonomic analysis indicated that exposure to a mixture of dichlorvos and deltamethrin was followed by increases in urinary lactate, dimethylamine, N-glycoprotein (NAC) and glycine similar to those observed in rats treated with either dichlorvos or deltamethrin alone. Serum metabonomic analysis suggests that dichlorvos induced an increase in lactate and alanine and a decrease in dimethylglycine (DMG), NAC and very low- and low-density lipoprotein (VLDL/LDL). High levels of lactate and low levels of NAC and VLDL/LDL were observed in the deltamethrin treatment group.

Twenty-one pregnant SD rats were divided into a corn oil control group and 6 dichlorvos groups, the former given by gavage 1.0 mL corn oil daily, and the latter dichlorvos at the dose of 1, 4, 8, 16, 20 and 24 mg/kg daily from the 12th to 17th day of conception. After birth, 5 male neonates were randomly selected from each of the control and dichlorvos groups, and their testes were harvested to be analyzed by HE staining, immunohistochemistry with anti-caspase-3 antibodies and DAPI fluorescent staining. At 90 days after birth, another 5 of the male offspring were taken from each group and their testes were collected for the same analyses. Statistically significant differences were found in the number of both the caspase-3 positive and DAPI labeled Leydig cells in the testes of the rat offspring between the corn oil and the 4, 8, 16, 20 and 24 mg/kg dichlorvos groups (P < 0.05), but not between the control and the 1 mg/kg dichlorvos groups (P > 0.05). The apoptosis of Leydig cells was increased in the male offspring of the dichlorvos-exposed SD rats in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of pregnant rats to dichlorvos can increase the apoptosis of Leydig cells in the male offspring, which, in turn, may reduce the number of Leydig cells, interfere with the testis function during the embryonic period, and damage the development of the genitourinary system."

Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence studies showed a significant reduction in the expression of M(1), M(2) and M(3) muscarinic receptor subtypes in high dose group animals, whereas in low dose group animals only the M(2) receptor subtype was reduced significantly. Further, the signal transduction cascade linked to these receptor subtypes was affected in high dose group animals whereas in low dose group only adenylyl cyclase-linked signaling pathway was impaired. Finally, the phosphorylation of CREB, a memory enhancing transcription factor, was significantly reduced in both low dose and high dose group animals.

Mitochondria, as a primary site of cellular energy generation and oxygen consumption represent itself a likely target for organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, the objective of the current study was planned with an aim to investigate the effect of chronic dichlorvos exposure on mitochondrial calcium uptake, oxidative stress generation and its implication in the induction of neuronal apoptosis in rodent model. Mitochondrial preparation from dichlorvos (DDVP) treated rat brain demonstrated significant increase in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake (644.2 nmol/mg protein). Our results indicated decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities of cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) along with altered mitochondrial complex I, and complex II activity, which might have resulted from elevated mitochondrial calcium uptake. The alterations in the mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial electron transfer enzyme activities in turn might have caused an increase in malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation as a result of enhanced lipid peroxidation, and as well as protein and mtDNA oxidation. All this could have been because of enhanced oxidative stress, decreased GSH levels and also decreased Mn-SOD activity in the mitochondria isolated from dichlorvos treated rat brain. Thus, chronic organophosphate exposure has the potential to disrupt cellular antioxidant defense system which in turn triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol as well as caspase-3 activation in dichlorvos treated rat brain as revealed by immunoblotting experiments. Low-level long-term organophosphate exposure finally resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. These studies provide an evidence of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptotic neuronal degeneration after chronic low-level exposure to dichlorvos."

Respiratory-related neurons in the brainstem are concentrated in a few areas, including ventral regions of the medulla, which contains a number of sites critical for respiratory rhythmogenesis, including the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC). The preBotC contains cholinergic receptors, making it a candidate site of action for the apnea-inducing effect of OP. We analyzed respiratory output during a series of experiments using both intact and reduced Wistar rat preparations exposed to dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate). Exposure of the brainstem using a working heart-brainstem preparation resulted in a central apnea similar to that seen in intact animal models. In contrast, microdialysis of locally toxic doses of dichlorvos to the ventral region of the medulla resulted in delayed and mild respiratory depression in most animals and apnea in only 29% of the animals. We conclude that exposure of the entire brainstem to OP is sufficient to induce central apnea. Our microdialysis experiments suggest that the neural substrate for OP-induced central apnea involves a specific brainstem site other than the ventral region of the medulla, or apnea might result from a distributed effect involving cholinergic toxicities of multiple brainstem sites."

Therefore, mechanisms that enhance their susceptibility to injury bear important implications for disease pathogenesis. We have previously shown that chronic dichlorvos exposure caused nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and significant behavioral impairments. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between microglial activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration to examine the possibility that neuroinflammation may induce dopaminergic neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal system. Chronic dichlorvos exposure causes microglial activation including induction of NADPH oxidase and a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in rat. Microglial marker expression was increased at transcription as well as translational levels in the substantia nigra (SN) and corpus striatum (CS) of rats exposed to dichlorvos. Activated microglia were seen in SN and CS of dichlorvos-treated animals but were rarely observed in controls. Immunostaining revealed lesser number of TH-positive neurons and higher number of microglia in SN and CS regions after dichlorvos treatment. The mRNA and protein levels of the NADPH oxidase main subunit gp91(phox) were significantly increased after dichlorvos administration. Dichlorvos exposure also leads to increased level of microglial noxious mediators such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in ventral midbrain and CS at transcription as well as translational levels. Data indicate that microglial activation and consequent induction of NADPH oxidase and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 may act as risk factors for Parkinson's disease by increasing the vulnerability of dopaminergic cells to dichlorvos toxic injury."

Previously we have shown that dichlorvos treatment promoted the levels of proinflammatory molecules and ultimately induced apoptotic cell death in primary microglial cells. Here we studied the effect of dichlorvos on crucial cell cycle regulatory proteins and the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We found a significant increase in p53 and its downstream target, p21, levels in dichlorvos-treated microglial cells compared with control cells. Moreover, dichlorvos exposure promoted the levels of different cell cycle regulatory proteins. These results along with flow cytometry results suggested that primary microglial cells were arrested at G1 and G2/M phase after dichlorvos exposure. We have shown in a previous study that dichlorvos can induce DNA damage in microglia; here we found that microglial cells also tried to repair this damage by inducing a DNA repair enzyme, i.e., ATM. We observed a significant increase in the levels of ATM after dichlorvos treatment compared with control."

The mRNA and protein expression of PON1 and Nrf2 in mouse diaphragmatic muscle cells was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of acetyl cholinesterase (AchE), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) in mouse diaphragmatic muscle cells. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in cells was measured by chemical colorimetry.

Previous studies from our lab have shown chronic Dichlorvos exposure leads to neuronal cell death in rats. However, the extent of damage caused by Dichlorvos to other cells of the central nervous system (CNS) is still not clear. Microglial cells are the primary threat sensors of CNS which become activated in many pathological conditions. Activation of microglial cells results in reactive microgliosis, manifested by increased cellular damage in the affected regions. Using rat primary microglial cultures, here we show that Dichlorvos exposure can activate and induce apoptotic cell death in microglia. We observed significant up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules like nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta when microglia were treated with Dichlorvos (10 uM). Significant up-regulation of CD11b, microglial specific activation marker, was also observed after 24 hr of Dichlorvos treatment. The activated microglial cells eventually undergo cell death after 48 hr of Dichlorvos treatment. The DNA fragmentation pattern of Dichlorvos treated microglia along with increased expression of Bax in mitochondria, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation led us to assume that microglia were undergoing apoptosis. Thus, the present study showed that Dichlorvos can induce microglial activation and ultimately apoptotic cell death. These findings gave new perspective to the current knowledge of Dichlorvos (OPs) mediated CNS damage and presents microglial activation as a potential therapeutic target for preventing the OP induced neuronal damage."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of carbaryl and dichlorvos on the activity of AChE. In this experimental study, 60 samples of free and immobilized form of AChE were prepared. Determination of AChE activity followed the Ellman's method with modifications. Briefly, 200 uL of the enzyme solution was combined with 400 uL of 25 mM phosphate-buffered saline, 200 uL of DTNB [5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)], and 200 uL of 300 uM acetylthiocholine iodide. Triplicate (1000 uL) samples were transferred to clean 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes, mixed, and held on ice until analyzed and the change in absorbance was measured. For inhibition studies, substrate solutions were pre-incubated with dichlorvos and/or carbaryl. Dichlorvos and carbaryl were used at the concentrations of 100 and 500 uM. The activity was evaluated at 412 nm using Ceceil, CE 1020 spectrophotometer. Phosphate buffer (pH 7.35) was used for blanks. AChE activity was quantified as mM/mL/min. AChE activity of free form is more affected by dichlorvos (0.09 +/- 0.03 mM/mL/min) than immobilized form (0.19 +/- 0.02 mM/mL/min). AChE activity of free form is more affected by carbaryl (0.11 +/- 0.01 mM/mL/min) than immobilized form (0.1 +/- 0.04 mM/mL/min). Comparison of mean AChE activity showed that the activity of the enzyme in presence of dichlorvos and carbaryl was significantly lower compared to controls. To calculate the significance of the difference, the t-test for paired values was applied. The results of our study indicate that dichlorvos and carbaryl cause decrease in AChE activity for both free and immobilization form of enzyme. It is therefore concluded that measuring AChE activity is a way to evaluate poisoning with carbaryl and dichlorvos."

We found that DIC inhibited the proliferation of PK15 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which may result from apoptosis induced by DIC. Microarray analyses revealed that 16 and 14 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and downregulated in PK15 cells treated by 0.875 mM DIC for 8 hr. Among the 30 differentially expressed miRNAs, 7 new miRNAs in pigs were predicted by homology-based searches. In addition, DIC upregulated 339 and downregulated 282 mRNA transcripts. A target prediction algorithm was used to analyze the pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Functional analysis indicated that these mRNAs belonged to different functional categories, forming a network participating in the DIC-induced apoptosis in PK15 cells.

The Koc for dichlorvos in three Japanese black soils with organic carbon content of 2.3-6.8% was reported as 47(2). The Koc was also reported as 50(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that dichlorvos is expected to have very high to moderate mobility in soil. In a field experiment, 18-20% of the dichlorvos which was sprayed on the ground had penetrated the soil to a depth of 30 cm within 5 days(5). The mobility of dichlorvos in soil is decreased by the addition of soil amendments such as calcium carbonate(6). Mobility of dichlorvos in soil decreases with increasing soil pH(7)."

Effects of combined exposure to dichlorvos and monocrotophos on blood and brain biochemical variables in rats. Human & Experimental Toxicology, 29(2), 121\u2013129. doi:10.1177/0960327109357212",
            "Value": "The research conducted by Nidhi Dwivedi et al. delved into the combined effects of two systemic insecticides, dichlorvos (DDVP) and monocrotophos (MC), on various biochemical variables in rats. Specifically focusing on DDVP, which belongs to the organophosphate group of pesticides, the study aimed to uncover how its interaction with MC might influence systemic responses in the body. DDVP is recognized as a systemic insecticide due to its ability to be absorbed and distributed throughout the body of target organisms, including insects. In this study, rats were exposed to DDVP either individually or in combination with MC. The results indicated that co-exposure to DDVP and MC led to significant changes in various biochemical parameters, such as neurotransmitter levels, enzyme activities, and oxidative stress markers. Notably, the study observed that the combined exposure resulted in more pronounced effects on certain variables, suggesting potential synergistic interactions between the two systemic insecticides."
