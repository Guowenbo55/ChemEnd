    "Description": "Thiacloprid is a nitrile that is cyanamide in which the hydrogens are replaced by a 1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene group which in turn is substituted by a (6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl group at the ring nitrogen. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a neonicotinoid insectide. It is a member of thiazolidines, a nitrile and a monochloropyridine. It is functionally related to a 2-chloropyridine and a cyanamide.",

            "Value": "Thiacloprid half-life in honeysuckle flowers was reported at 4.1 days and in leaves at 1.1 days following application of the recommended dose. At the recommended dose, thiacloprid was reported as a residue at an average concentration of 0.55 mg/kg 7 days following application and at 0.022 mg/kg 14 days following application to honeysuckle plants. At two times the recommended dose, thiacloprid was reported as a residue at an average concentration of 1.37 mg/kg 7 days following application and at 0.046 mg/kg 14 days following application to honeysuckle plants. Sun, shade, and oven drying techniques were tested for the degradation effects on the drying process in tea-making, resulting in the percentage of digestion ranging from 37.7% to 77.3%. Thiacloprid was applied to honeysuckle samples, let stand for 1 hour, and then brewed in tea for 2 to 60 minutes. The percentage of thiacloprid transferred from leaves to tea ranged from 16.1% to 23.4%(1). The half-life of thiacloprid in cotton leaves grown from treated seeds is about 3 days(2)."

            "content": "The present study aimed to investigate the distribution and migration of eleven systemic and non-systemic pesticides between the skin and pulp of apples. It also examined the behavior of these pesticides during thermal processes ranging from 40\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C in two apple varieties. Gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were employed for analytical investigations. Variations in pesticide concentrations between the pulp and skin were observed depending on the apple variety. Pirimicarb showed the highest transfer to the pulp, while boscalid and deltamethrin remained predominantly on the skin. Surprisingly, boscalid was found to be more present in the apple skin than in the pulp. Drying and dry pasteurization processes were the most effective in reducing pesticide levels in apples with and without skin, respectively. Thermal processes resulted in processing factors ranging from 0.06 to 0.98 for ten pesticides, with acetamiprid being the only pesticide whose levels were not decreased. The study discussed the relationship between pesticide distribution, behavior, and physico-chemical properties, particularly water solubility. The findings contribute to a better understanding of pesticide efficacy and removal in apples.",

The shoot and root concentrations of each chemical varied among the plant species. Root concentration factor values increased with an increasing log of the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) of the organic chemicals, suggesting that root concentrations may be predicted to some extent based on log Kow. Root-to-shoot translocation was also related to log Kow, as the shoot-to-root concentration ratio decreased with increasing log Kow. However, the relationship between shoot concentration factor value and log Kow was not clear and differed among plant species.",
