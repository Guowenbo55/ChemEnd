            "Value": "When soluble powder or emulsifiable concentrate formulations of chlordimeform was applied to Hagerstown silt loam soil, the residue decreased rapidly but 10% was detectable after 500 days. The material did not readily leach or accumulate in the depths of field plots. Trace amounts were observed in turnips but no accumulation occurred in carrots or potatoes. 4-Chloro-o-toluidine, accounting for less than 20% of the chlordimeform applied, was formed and exhibited greater persistence than the parent material. When high levels (45 lb ai/A) of chlordimeform were applied to soil, 4,4'-dichloro-2,2'-dimethylazobenzene was isolated and identified but found not to be persistent. This compound also formed in non-autoclaved soil when high levels of chlordimeform or 4-chloro-o-toluidine was present. The azo derivative and 4-chloro-o-formotoluidine also arose from the action of sunlight on 4-chloro-o-toluidine. The 4,4'-dichloro-2,2'-dimethylazobenzene was absorbed by cabbage and corn and translocated to aerial parts but disappeared rapidly."

Cultures of mixed populations (inoculum unknown) of soil micro-organisms from Louisiana Commerce Silt Loam and Indiana Clay Loam were prepared and suspended in 50 ml of a synthetic medium containing 25 ug/ml chlordimeform.

            "Value": "Soil thin-layer chromatography was used to determine the mobility of pesticides in soil. Chlordimeform was found to have an Rf value of 0.04, which places it in mobility class 1: immobile(1). The interaction of fulvic acid extracted from a Spodosol soil classified as humic haplorthod, from near Ribadeo, Spain with pesticides was observed. Results showed that the pH of chlordimeform ranged from 4.10 to 4.96 before interaction with fulvic acid solution and pH ranged from 3.21 to 3.24 after interaction with fulvic acid solutions. Both the weight of the precipitate formed in solution and the coloring of the equilibrium solution indicate that fulvic acid persists in solution in spite of an excess of chlordimeform(2). The interaction of chlordimeform with humic and fulvic acids from different soils was examined. Humic acids (HA) were extracted from four soils: two classified as typic Chromoxerert (gathered from Utrera and Los Palacios, Spain), a Podsol soil from Lugo, Spain, and an Andosol soil from Las Lajas, Canaries, Spain. Fulvic acids (FA) were extracted from the Podsol and Andosol soils. Maximum adsorption of chlordimeform on HA soils and FA soils are as follows: HA T. Chromoxerert (Utrera) - 1,300 umol/g; HA T. Chromoxerert (Los Palacios) - 1183 umol/g; HA Andosol - 1,100 umol/g; HA Podsol - 1,675 umol/g; FA Andosol - 990 umol/g; FA Podsol - 1475 umol/g(3)."

            "Value": "The lethality of chlordimeform (CDM) in rats is likely attributed to its local anesthetic-like actions, which lead to depressor effects on the cardiovascular system. Research by Lund et al. and Pfister et al. observed that the toxic symptoms of CDM in mice resemble those caused by an overdose of systemic local anesthetics, suggesting a systemic local anesthetic effect. CDM and its analogs were found to block adrenal catecholamine release, similar to the action of local anesthetics that inhibit adrenomedullary secretion. The effectiveness of CDM and its analogs against the stimulant effect of acetylcholine in the adrenal medulla and their lethal doses in rats and mice show a parallel relationship. Furthermore, certain metabolites of chlordimeform were found to inhibit acetylcholine-evoked catecholamine release in isolated bovine adrenals, and their effectiveness in isolated adrenals parallels their toxicity in rats and mice. Since local anesthetics are known to block adrenomedullary secretion and systemic local anesthetic effects have been implicated in the toxicity of chlordimeform, the results of these studies support the hypothesis that a local anesthetic action is significant in the systemic toxicity of chlordimeform and its metabolites. Additionally, demethylchlordimeform strongly inhibits calcium-evoked secretion from isolated adrenals, suggesting that blocking calcium influx may be an important aspect of the toxicology of formamidine pesticides."
