    "Description": "Cyclanilide is a monocarboxylic acid that is cyclopropanecarboxylic acid that is substituted by a 3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamoyl group at position 1. It is a plant growth regulator which is used as a cotton harvest aid. It has a role as a plant growth regulator and a fungicide. It is a dichlorobenzene, a member of cyclopropanes, an anilide and a monocarboxylic acid.",

            "content": "Greenhouse studies were conducted to evaluate the rain-free requirement for mepiquat chloride and mepiquat chloride plus cyclanilide with and without surfactant, as well as to assess the absorption and translocation of cyclanilide, a component of a new cotton plant growth regulator. The results showed no significant differences in the number of nodes, leaf area, and fresh and dry weight of plant parts with any plant growth regulator (PGR) treatment and rainfall simulation combination. Both PGRs responded similarly to rainfall interval, with an increase in rain-free period leading to reduced cotton height. The data indicated that an 8-hour rain-free period is necessary to maximize efficacy, regardless of the use of surfactant. Cyclanilide absorption ranged from 11 to 15% at 3 and 48 hours after treatment (HAT), respectively. On average, 18% of the applied cyclanilide remained in the treated leaf, while 1.7 and 6.5% were found in the above and below treated leaf tissue, respectively.",
