Ferbam took longer than 8 weeks to reach the half-decay point in humus sandy soils as determined by activity to Rhizoctonia solani. If the humus content was 1.2% or below, an initial lag in the start of decomposition was observed(2). Ferbam releases carbon disulfide when it decomposes in soil(3)."

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that ferbam is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Using a soil TLC system (Hagerstown silty clay loam, 2.5% organic matter, 39.5% clay, pH 6.8) visualized by bioautography with 10 soil fungi and one alga, mean Rf values for analytical grade ferbam were 0.93, 0.64, 0.36, and 0.0(4)."

            "Value": "Ferbam is classified as a non-systemic protective fungicide. It works by inhibiting spore germination on plant surfaces, but is not absorbed or translocated within plant tissues. Ferbam forms a barrier film on exterior leaf and stem surfaces, but does not penetrate internally or have mobility in the xylem/phloem. It must be reapplied frequently as protective residues get washed off by rain and cannot redistribute inside the plant. In summary, ferbam lacks systemic activity and acts solely through localized surface contact on leaves and stems. It cannot be taken up or transported within the plant after application."
