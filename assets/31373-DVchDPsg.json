Natural attenuation analysis of tetrachloroethylene biodegradation in an anaerobic chlorinated ethene contaminated aquifer in the Bitterfeld/Wolfen area identified potential dechlorinating microorganims including Dehalococcoides, Desulfuromonas, Desulfitobacterium and Deholabacter(3). Using an enrichment culture developed from aquifer solids exposed to alkylbenzenes and chlorinated ethenes at the US Coast Guard Air Station in Traverse City, MI and employing toluene as the sole carbon source, tetrachloroethylene dechlorination slowed during days 46-89 following depletion of toluene. Respiking toluene at day 94 resulted in immediate restoration rate of tetrachloroethylene dechlorination(4). Under reducing conditions, tetrachloroethylne degrades via hydrogenolysis to trichloroethylene, ultimately resulting in vinyl chloride via cis-1,2-dichloroethylene(5). In anaerobic microcosms established with surface sediments from tidal flats, tetrachloroethylene dechloronation began within 10 days and was 100% converted to trichloroethylene in 37 days(6)."

Recent health assessments of these agents identified several critical data gaps, including lack of comparative analysis of their effects. This study examined liver and kidney effects of TCE and PCE in a dose-response study design. Equimolar doses of TCE (24, 80, 240, and 800 mg/kg) or PCE (30, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg) were administered by gavage in aqueous vehicle to male B6C3F1/J mice. Tissues were collected 24 hr after exposure. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a major oxidative metabolite of both compounds, was measured and RNA sequencing was performed. PCE had a stronger effect on liver and kidney transcriptomes, as well as greater concentrations of TCA. Most dose-responsive pathways were common among chemicals/tissues, with the strongest effect on peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Effects on liver and kidney mitochondria-related pathways were notably unique to PCE. We performed dose-response modeling of the transcriptomic data and compared the resulting points of departure (PODs) to those for apical endpoints derived from long-term studies with these chemicals in rats, mice, and humans, converting to human equivalent doses using tissue-specific dosimetry models. Tissue-specific acute transcriptional effects of TCE and PCE occurred at human equivalent doses comparable to those for apical effects. These data are relevant for human health assessments of TCE and PCE as they provide data for dose-response analysis of the toxicity mechanisms. Additionally, they provide further evidence that transcriptomic data can be useful surrogates for in vivo PODs, especially when toxicokinetic differences are taken into account."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent condition that can dramatically affect chemical metabolism. We examined the effect of NAFLD on toxicokinetics of tetrachloroethylene (PERC), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that requires metabolic activation to induce adverse health effects. Mice (C57Bl/6J, male) were fed a low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), or methionine/folate/choline-deficient diet (MCD) to model a healthy liver, steatosis, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively. After 8 weeks, mice were orally administered a single dose of PERC (300 mg/kg) or vehicle (aqueous Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points (1-36 hours). Levels of PERC and its metabolites were measured in blood/serum, liver, and fat. Effects of diets on liver gene expression and tissue:air partition coefficients were evaluated. We found that hepatic levels of PERC were 6- and 7.6-fold higher in HFD- and MCD-fed mice compared with LFD-fed mice; this was associated with an increased PERC liver:blood partition coefficient. Liver and serum Cmax for trichloroacetate (TCA) was lower in MCD-fed mice; however, hepatic clearance of TCA was profoundly reduced by HFD or MCD feeding, leading to TCA accumulation. Hepatic mRNA/protein expression and ex vivo activity assays revealed decreased xenobiotic metabolism in HFD- and MCD-, compared with LFD-fed, groups. In conclusion, experimental NAFLD was associated with modulation of xenobiotic disposition and metabolism and increased hepatic exposure to PERC and TCA. Underlying NAFLD may be an important susceptibility factor for PERC-associated hepatotoxicity."

The nephrotoxic potential of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxide (TCVCS) in rats and TCVCS formation in rat liver and kidney microsomes were investigated. At 5 mM S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (TCVC), rat liver microsomes formed TCVCS at a rate nearly 5 times higher than the rate measured with rat kidney microsomes, whereas at 1 mM TCVC only the liver activity was detectable. TCVCS formation in liver and kidney microsomes was dependent upon the presence of NADPH and was inhibited by the addition of methimazole or 1-benzylimidazole, but not superoxide dismutase, catalase, KCN, or deferoxamine, consistent with the involvement of both flavin containing monooxygenases (FMOs) and P450s. Rats given TCVCS at 230 umol/kg ip exhibited acute tubular necrosis at 2 and 24 hr after treatment, and they had elevated blood urea nitrogen levels at 24 hr, whereas TCVC was a much less potent nephrotoxicant than TCVCS. Furthermore, pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid enhanced TCVC toxicity. In addition, reduced nonprotein thiol concentrations in the kidney were decreased by nearly 50% 2 hr after TCVCS treatment compared with saline-treated rats, whereas the equimolar dose of TCVC had no effect on kidney nonprotein thiol status. No significant lesions or changes in nonprotein thiol status were observed in liver with either TCVC or TCVCS. ... /S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine, S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxide/"

Male Swiss-Cox mice received either trichloroethylene (0 to 3200 mg/kg/day) or perchloroethylene (0 to 2000 mg/kg/day) in corn oil by gavage for 6 weeks. Urinary metabolites from individual mice were quantified to estimate the extent to which each compound was metabolized. Four parameters of hepatotoxicity were assessed: liver weight, triglycerides, glucose-6-phophatase activity, and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activity. Trichloroethylene sigificantly affected liver weight and glucose-6-phosphatase activity; perchloroethylene affected all four parameters. The metabolism of trichloroethylene was linearly related to dose through 1600 mg/kg, but then became saturated. The metabolism of perchloroethylene was saturable. The dose-effect curves of the affected hepatotoxicity parameters of both compounds were nonlinear and resembled the dose-metabolism graph of the corresponding solvent. Plots of the hepatotoxicity data of each compound against total urinary metabolites were linear in all cases, suggesting that the hepatotoxicity of both perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene in mice is directly related to the extent of their metabolism. This pattern is consistent with formation of the toxic intermediate in the primary metabolic pathway of each compound."

The increase was statistically significant at 37 ppm in animals continuously exposed for 30 days. BuChE increased approximately 1.5 times in females and 2.5 times in males after 120 days exposure to 150 p.p.m. After rehabilitation of animals exposed for 30 days to 150 ppm, BuChE levels returned to normal. Liver weight also increased in a time and concentration dependent manner. Both sexes exhibited significant liver enlargement at 9 ppm. The increase was about 2.3 in females and 1.9 in males after continuous exposure to 150 ppm for 120 days. After rehabilitation (120 days) of animals exposed to 150 ppm for 30 days, a 10% increase still remained. A decrease in body weight gain was seen in both sexes after exposure to concentrations above 75 ppm. Female kidney weight was slightly increased. No clear effect on spleen weight could be detected. When the same time-weighted average concentration was used, intermittent exposure for 30 days had similar effects on liver weight and BuChE activity as continuous exposure, even when exposures lasted for only one hour per day. Liver cell morphology was changed after PCE exposure. The alterations could be observed already at 9 ppm but disappeared after rehabilitation."

Male Swiss Webster mice (25-29 g) were given three dose levels of Perc (150, 500, and 1000 mg/kg day) via aqueous gavage for 30 days. Tissue injury was measured during the dosing regimen (0, 1, 7, 14, and 30 days) and over a time course of 24-96 hr after the last dose (30 days). Perc produced significant liver injury (ALT) after single day exposure to all three doses. Liver injury was mild to moderate and regressed following repeated exposure for 30 days. Subchronic Perc exposure induced neither kidney injury nor dysfunction during the entire time course as evidenced by normal renal histology and BUN. TCA was the major metabolite detected in blood, liver, and kidney. Traces of DCA were also detected in blood at initial time points after single day exposure. With single day exposure, metabolism of Perc to TCA was saturated with all three doses. AUC/dose ratio for TCA was significantly decreased with a concomitant increase in AUC/dose of Perc levels in liver and kidney after 30 days as compared to 1 day exposures, indicating inhibition of metabolism upon repeated exposure to Perc. Hepatic CYP2E1 expression and activity were unchanged indicating that CYP2E1 is not the critical enzyme inhibited. Hepatic CYP4A expression, measured as a marker of peroxisome proliferation was increased transiently only on day 7 with the high dose, but was unchanged at later time points. Liver tissue repair peaked at 7 days, with all three doses and was sustained after medium and high dose exposure for 14 days. ..."

There are wide confidence limits on the data, and some of the error bars approach zero. There is a very low spontaneous incidence of renal tumors in Fischer 344 rats. Induction of renal tumors in rats by tetrachloroethylene is therefore easily observed against a low background.

The dose-dependent bioavailability of TCA in B6C3F1 mice exposed to TCA in drinking water was estimated by optimizing the fit of time course blood, plasma, and liver TCA concentrations for TCA doses ranging from 12 to 800 mg/(kg day) to predictions of a previously published TCA PBPK model. Using the PBPK models, the area under the liver TCA concentration vs. time curve (liver TCA AUC) was calculated for TCA and perc bioassays. Benchmark dose analyses were conducted to determine the dose-response relationship between liver TCA AUC and the additional risk of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in mice ingesting TCA. Using the dose-response relationships derived for the TCA-exposed mice, the contribution of TCA produced by metabolism to the additional risk of liver adenomas and carcinomas in mice exposed to perchloroethylene by inhalation was computed.

Actual chamber concentrations were essentially identical to target with the exception of the low PERC exposure level, which was 65 ppm. The highest exposure levels exceeded the limit concentration (2 mg/L) specified in the applicable test guidelines. Maternal necropsies were performed the day following the last exposure. Dams exposed to 600 ppm TCE exhibited maternal toxicity, as evidenced by decreased body weight gain (22% less than control) during GD 6-9. There were no maternal effects at 50 or 150 ppm TCE and no indications of developmental toxicity (including heart defects or other terata) at any exposure level tested. Therefore, the TCE NOEC for maternal toxicity was 150 ppm, whereas the embryo/fetal NOEC was 600 ppm. Maternal responses to PERC were limited to slight, but statistically significant reductions in body weight gain and feed consumption during the first 3 days of exposure to 600 ppm, resulting in a maternal NOEC of 250 ppm. Developmental effects at 600 ppm consisted of reduced gravid uterus, placental and fetal body weights, and decreased ossification of thoracic vertebral centra. Developmental effects at 250 ppm were of minimal toxicological significance, being limited to minor decreases in fetal and placental weight. There were no developmental effects at 65 ppm."

The ATSDR concluded that it was unlikely that these chemicals, specifically chloroform, bromoform (Trihalomethanes; THMs) and tetrachloroethylene (Perchloroethylene; PCE) had contributed to the prevalence of autism in this community based upon correlations between timing of exposure and/or concentration of exposure. The ATSDR conclusion may have been premature, as there is no conclusive data evidencing a correlation between a particular developmental time point that would render an individual most susceptible to toxicological insult with the development of autism. Therefore, it was our aim to determine if these chemicals could contribute to autistic like behaviors. We found that males treated with THMs and PCE have a significant reduction in the number of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted in response to maternal separation, which are not attributed to deficits in vocal ability to or to lesser maternal care. These same males also show significantly elevated anxiety, an increase in perseverance behavior and a significant reduction in sociability. The sum of our data suggests that male, but not female mice, develop autistic like behaviors after gestational and postnatal exposure to the aforementioned chemical triad via drinking water. We believe development of such aberrant behaviors likely involves GABAergic system development."

Visual function was assessed using steady-state pattern-elicited visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from rats during exposure to air or PCE in two experiments (total n = 84) with concentrations of PCE ranging from 250 to 4000 ppm. VEP waveforms were submitted to a spectral analysis in which the major response component, F2, occurring at twice the visual stimulation rate, was reduced in amplitude by PCE exposure. The F2 amplitudes were transformed to an effect-magnitude scale ranging from 0 (no effect) to 1 (maximum possible effect), and a logistical function was fit to the transformed values as a function of estimated concurrent brain PCE concentrations. The resultant function described a dose-response relationship between brain PCE concentration and changes in visual function with an ED(10) value of approximately 0.684 mg/L and an ED(50) value of approximately 46.5 mg/L.

The current study sought to assess the effects of inhaled /perchloroethylene/ PCE on sustained attention in rats performing a visual signal detection task (SDT). Due to its similarities in physiological effect to toluene and trichloroethylene (TCE), two other commonly used volatile organic compounds (VOCs) known to reduce attention in rats, we hypothesized (1) that acute inhalation of PCE (0, 500, 1000, 1500 ppm) would disrupt performance of the SDT in rats; (2) that impaired accuracy would result from changes in attention to the visual signal; and (3) that these acute effects would diminish upon repetition of exposure. PCE impaired performance of the sustained attention task as evidenced by reduced accuracy [P(correct): 500 to 1500 ppm], elevated response time [RT: 1000 and 1500 ppm] and reduced number of trials completed [1500 ppm]. These effects were concentration-related and either increased (RT and trial completions) or remained constant [P(correct)] across the 60-min test session. The PCE-induced reduction in accuracy was primarily due to an increase in false alarms, a pattern consistent with reduced attention to the signal. A repeat of the exposures resulted in smaller effects on these performance measures. Thus, like toluene and TCE, inhaled PCE acutely impaired sustained attention in rats, and its potency weakened upon repetition of the exposure."

DCVC and TCVC have previously been demonstrated to be mutagenic by the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, and reduction in mutagenicity was observed upon treatment with the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). Because DCVC and TCVC can also be bioactivated through sulfoxidation to yield the potent nephrotoxicants S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (DCVCS) and S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (TCVCS), respectively, the mutagenic potential of these two sulfoxides was investigated using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA100 mutagenicity assay. The results show both DCVCS and TCVCS were mutagenic, and TCVCS exhibited 3-fold higher mutagenicity than DCVCS. However, DCVCS and TCVCS mutagenic activity was approximately 700-fold and 30-fold lower than DCVC and TCVC, respectively. DCVC and DCVCS appeared to induce toxicity in TA100, as evidenced by increased microcolony formation and decreased mutant frequency above threshold concentrations. TCVC and TCVCS were not toxic in TA100. The toxic effects of DCVC limited the sensitivity of TA100 to DCVC mutagenic effects and rendered it difficult to investigate the effects of AOAA on DCVC mutagenic activity. Collectively, these results suggest that DCVCS and TCVCS exerted a definite but weak mutagenicity in the TA100 strain. Therefore, despite their potent nephrotoxicity, DCVCS and TCVCS are not likely to play a major role in DCVC or TCVC mutagenicity in this strain."

In some of these studies, commercial or technical grades of tetrachloroethene were also tested and found to induce mutations. Because the same studies yielded negative results when highly purified tetrachloroethene was tested, it appears that impurities were responsible for the mutagenic responses. One study (a spot test) that produced a positive result (in S. typhimurium TA100) did not report the purity of the test compound. When tetrachloroethene was preincubated with purified rat liver glutathione-S-transferases in the presence of glutathione and rat kidney fraction, the resulting product was mutagenic in the Ames test, apparently due to the formation of the genotoxic intermediate, S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)cysteine."

However, experimental evidence suggesting the potential of PCE in mediating autoimmunity is lacking. This study was, therefore, undertaken to explore PCE's potential in inducing/exacerbating an autoimmune response. Six-week old female MRL+/+ mice, in groups of 6 each, were treated with PCE (0.5 mg/mL) via drinking water for 12, 18 and 24weeks and markers of autoimmunity and oxidative stress were evaluated. PCE exposure led to significant increases in serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA and anti-scleroderma-70 (anti-Scl-70) antibodies at 18weeks and, to a greater extent at 24weeks, suggesting that PCE exposure exacerbated autoimmunity in our animal model. The increases in autoantibodies were associated with time-dependent increases in malondialdehyde (MDA)-protein adducts and their antibodies, as well as significantly decreased levels of antioxidants GSH and SOD. The splenocytes isolated from mice treated with PCE for 18 and 24 weeks showed greater Th17 cell proliferation and increased release of IL-17 in culture supernatants following stimulation with MDA-mouse serum albumin adducts, suggesting that MDA-modified proteins may act as an immunologic trigger by activating Th17 cells and contribute to PCE-mediated autoimmunity. Our studies thus provide an experimental evidence that PCE induces/exacerbates an autoimmune response and lipid-derived aldehydes (such as MDA) contribute to this response."

Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) were orally administered a single dose of PERC (1,000 mg/kg) or vehicle (Alkamuls-EL620) and euthanized at various time points (n = 1/strain/time).

Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined. Based on area under the curve (AUC), the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude (approximately 8-fold). Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels. Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss, induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha)-regulated genes, and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Clustering was observed among a) liver levels of PERC, TCA, and triglycerides; b) TCA levels in liver and kidney; and c) TCA levels in serum, brain, fat, and lung.

The hypothesis that the mutagenic metabolites of tetrachloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene-epoxide, TCA, DCA, chloral hydrate [if it is formed], and TCVG) initiate carcinogenesis and that tetrachloroethylene-induced promotion of initiated foci, cytotoxicity, and epigenetic events promote carcinogenesis cannot be ruled out."

Using the PBPK models, the area under the liver TCA concentration vs. time curve (liver TCA AUC) was calculated for TCA and perc bioassays. Benchmark dose analyses were conducted to determine the dose-response relationship between liver TCA AUC and the additional risk of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in mice ingesting TCA.
