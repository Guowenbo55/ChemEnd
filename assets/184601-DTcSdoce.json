However, knowledge of its uptake, translocation, and biotransformation within plants is still largely unknown, restricting work on its accurate and comprehensive risk assessment. Here, we systematically investigated the behavior of imidaclothiz in three plant\u2212water systems via hydroponic experiments. The results showed that imidaclothiz was readily taken up by plant roots and translocated upward, resulting in relative enrichment in leaves. The recoveries of imidaclothiz in plant\u2212water systems decreased with increasing exposure time, and  approximately 31.8\u221245.6% mass loss was measured at the end of exposure. Ultimately, imidaclothiz yielded five products in celery leaves, three products in lettuce leaves, and two products in radish leaves. Multiple metabolic reactions including hydroxylation, hydrolysis of nitrate ester, and methylation occurred within plants. This is the first report on the fate of imidaclothiz within plants and suggests increasing concerns about the risk assessment of imidaclothiz.",

They were then transferred to single hydroponic buckets containing 600 mL of nutrient solution for further cultivation.
