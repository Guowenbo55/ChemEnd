    "Description": "Nabam is a dithiocarbamate salt that is the disodium salt of ethylenebis(dithiocarbamic acid). A fungicide, algicide and bactericide used on various crops including on cotton, capsicums, onions and rice crops, it is considered to be a carcinogen, so is not licensed for use within the European Union. Mixing nabam with zinc sulfate affords the fungicide zineb. It has a role as an antifungal agrochemical. It is a dithiocarbamate salt and an organic sodium salt. It contains an ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate).",

Incubation of nabam and zineb with hepatic microsomes, without NADPH, leads to an inhibition of the metabolism of aminopyrine and aniline and to a denaturation of cytochrome P-450 into cytochrome P-420; in addition nabam causes the destruction of cytochrome P-450. Addition of NADPH into the incubation medium increases the inhibition of the monooxygenases, principally the inhibition of the metabolism of aniline induced by nabam ... The in vitro effects of three of the chief breakdown products of these fungicides: ethylene bis-isothiocyanate sulfide (EBIS), ethylene thiourea (ETU), and carbon disulfide (CS2) /were studied/. EBIS appears to be the only metabolite affecting directly (without NADPH) the hepatic monooxygenases activity. EBIS accounted partly for nabam-induced inhibition of the hepatic microsomal monooxygenases. The data suggest that the decrease of monooxygenases activity seen on incubation of nabam with hepatic microsomes may be due to the denaturation and destruction of cytochrome P-450 resulting from covalent binding of the compounds with cysteine sulfhydryl groups in cytochrome P-450. Inhibition of monooxygenase activity induced by zineb seems to be due to the reaction with the sulfhydryl groups of cytochrome P-450 and to another mechanism, probably related to its lipophilic character."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ For the in vitro tests, the sulfhydryl enzymes urease and peroxidase not regarded as a typical sulfhydryl enzyme were incubated with pure preparation of Maneb, Zineb, and Nabam and their degradation products: ethylene-bis-thiuram disulfide, ethylene-bis-thiuram monosulfide, ethylene-bis-thiourea, and ethylene-bis-diisothiocyanate. The marked (40%) inhibition of urease by ethylene-bis-diisothiocyanate at low concentration (10-6 mol/L.) was noteworthy. At higher concn, the intact dithiocarbamates display greater inhibitory effects on both enzymes than the degradation products (approaching 100% at 10-3 mol/L)."

While ETU levels remained low (<0.2 ppm) in freshly analyzed leaf samples across the 15-day period, frozen leaf samples harvested 18 months later showed higher ETU content for nabam treatments compared to maneb. This suggests that nabam, which is highly water soluble, may have been absorbed and translocated within soybean plants after subsurface application. Over the long storage period, the translocated nabam likely degraded into ETU within leaf tissues. As a less water soluble fungicide, maneb would not be expected to translocate in the same manner. However, all EBDCs are known to degrade unstable in various environmental conditions, making the direct persistence of the parent compounds an unlikely explanation for the higher ETU in frozen leaf samples many months later.",
