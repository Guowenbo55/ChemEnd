A BCF of 7300 was measured in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in static bioconcentration experiments(10). BCF values of 1660 to 2820 and 903 to 2710 were determined in carp (Cyprinus carpio) using flow-through conditions and anthracene concentrations of 15 and 1.5 ug/L, respectively(11). According to a classification scheme(12), these BCFs suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from moderate to very high(SRC). The BCF in Daphnia magna was found to decrease with increasing concentration of Aldrich humic acids: BCF (dissolved organic carbon, mg/L), 607 (0.2) and 319 (2.0); however, this difference was not considered significant due to the large sample variance(13). Aldrich humic acids in water did not significantly alter Daphnia magna accumulation of anthracene: BCF (dissolved organic carbon, mg/L), 389 (0.3), 362 (1.5), and 340 (5.7)(13). Depuration half-lives of 57 and 63 hours relative to contaminated and clean water, respectively, were measured in zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, exposed to (14)C-labeled anthracene adsorbed on sediment(14)."

            "Value": "Uptake, depuration, and biotransformation rates of (14)carbon-labeled anthracene were determined for Pontoporeia hoyi, the dominant benthic invertebrate in the Great Lakes, at 4, 7, 10, and 15 \u00b0C(1). The uptake rate constants increased from 136/hr to 215/hr over the temp range studied and were seasonally dependent(1). The depuration rate constant at the apparent optimum temp of 7 \u00b0C was 0.015/hr for anthracene(1). The biotransformation ability of Pontoporeia hoyi is low, and degradation of anthracene was undetectable even after exposures of 48 hr(1). The bioconcentration factor can be predicted from the uptake and depuration kinetics to be approx 16,800 at 4 \u00b0C(1). The effects of temperature and anthracene concentration on uptake and depuration rate constants and bioconcentration factors were determined for larvae of the midge, Chironomus riparius(2). At 25 \u00b0C, the uptake rate constant estimated from 10 hr and 30 hr exposure and by the initial rate methods increased with concentration between 1.7 and 30.5 ug/L(2). At a constant concentration (22 ug/L), the uptake rate constant was max at 25 \u00b0C and less at 16 and 30 \u00b0C(2). Bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) were exposed to (14)C-labeled anthracene in water. Rates of uptake and biotransformation within the fish were followed by (14)C counting and thin layer and liquid chromatography(3). The initial uptake rate coefficient for anthracene was independent of exposure concentration(3). Biotransformation of the anthracene was constant at 0.22 nmol/g/hr, with approx 92% of the residue unmetabolized at 4 hr., 6% of the anthracene was found in liver and gall bladder(3). Depuration rates were first-order and yielded a half-life of 17 hrs for anthracene(3). The estimated bioconcentration factor for anthracene in whole fish (Kuptake/Kdepuration) was 900, for total (14)carbon activity, but only 675 for parent material(3). This bioconcentration factor was considerably lower than that predicted from the octanol water partition coefficient, because of biotransformation(SRC)."

Anthracene was reported as being slightly susceptible to oxidation by benzene-acclimated sludge at 20 \u00b0C(2). Approximately 175 mg/L oxygen uptake was observed over 72 hours, the sludge alone accounted for approximately 100 mg/L oxygen uptake(2). 5% conversion to CO2 was observed in 18 hr in Third Creek water (Knox Co, TN), no degradation of anthracene was observed in water from Walker Branch (Anderson Co, TN)(3). No degradation of anthracene was observed in estuarine water collected in April from the Skidway River, GA, after 24 hours(4). 8.3 to 19.0% and 37.2 to 58.1% degradation of anthracene was observed after 10 weeks incubation in fresh and ripe composts of municipal waste, respectively, from 6 cities in Germany(5). Degradation with gradual adaptation was reported for anthracene (5 and 10 mg/L) incubated with sewage seed, 43% and 26% degradation after 7 days, 92% and 51% degradation after 28 days and 3 weekly subcultures(6). Anthracene reached 2% of its theoretical BOD (BOD5 tests) using inoculum from 3 polluted surface waters(7). Anthracene was confirmed to be poorly or non-biodegradable in MITI tests(8). Anthracene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 1.9% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(9). An initial anthracene concentration of 4.7 ug/mL was reduced to 0.5 ug/mL after 14 days incubation in shake flasks containing creosote contaminated groundwater and surface soil(10). In a pilot-scale treatability study, 100% of the anthracene present in contaminated groundwater was biodegraded over a period of 36 days in a publicly owned treatment works employing activated sludge treatment(11)."

The dissipation (probably through biodegradation; microbial numbers were greater in the vegetated soils) of anthracene in soil was enhanced by the presence of vegetation(3). The degradation rate of anthracene in Georgia coast sediment with crude oil added was observed to be 2.0 to 2.6%/wk(4). 31% degradation of anthracene was observed after 5 hrs of incubation in sediment collected 0.5 km below coking plant discharge(5). 13% degradation in 24 hours was observed in sediment contaminated by oil; 66% degradation was observed in 7 days(6). The biodegradation rate of anthracene in flooded soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions was observed to be 0.38 ppm/day; under denitrifying conditions the biodegradation rate ranged from 0.28 to 0.29 ppm/day(7). A half-life of 3.0 weeks was estimated for anthracene in sludge-treated Caledon sandy loam soil (730 g/kg sand, 200 g/kg silt, 70 g/kg clay)(8). Following an acclimation period of 2 weeks, anthracene was degraded by the indigenous microbial consortium in soil at an old oil reclamation facility with an estimated half-life of 19 days(9). In a soil column study containing sandy soil samples from a site contaminated with creosote, an initial anthracene concentration of approximately 800 mg/kg was reduced to less than 400 mg/kg following 170 days incubation(10). Anthracene mineralization rates ranged from 10 to 60% following 64 days incubation in soils collected from an abandoned coal tar refinery(11). Biodegradation half-lives of 134 and 50 days were observed for anthracene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(12).

The mineralization half-life of anthracene has been reported to be 57 to 21 days in unacclimatized sediments and 5 to 7 days in oil treated sediments. The mineralization half-life of anthracene was also reported to be 200 days in oil-treated water and 20 fold higher in uncontaminated water. The overall biotransformation (both carbon dioxide and intermediate metabolite formation) half-life of anthracene in petroleum contaminated sediment was reported to be 12 days. In pristine sediments, the overall biotransformation half-life was 10 fold higher. The overall biotransformation half-life of anthracene in sediments contaminated with a coal coking wastewater was 2 days; the transformation rate was 20 times lower in the water. The biodegradability of anthracene with natural sediments and natural estuarine waters has been studied. The biodegradation of anthracene in aquatic media is controlled by the temperature, oxygen content and acclimatization or nonacclimatization of the microorganisms. Higher biodegradation rates were observed at 30 \u00b0C than at 20 and 10 \u00b0C. The biodegradation process was found to be aerobic and higher oxygen concentration up to a certain optimum value tended to increase the oxidation rates. Similarly, the biodegradation rates were reported to be faster with acclimatized microorganisms. The incubation of anthracene with intertidal sediment slurries for a reasonable period of time (approximately 1 month) not only produces the mineralization product carbon dioxide but also produces intermediate metabolites. A large portion of the initial material or its intermediate metabolites (which could not be identified because (14)C counting of the combustion products of residue was used as the method of quantification) remained cellular bound(1)."

The changes seen were qualitatively similar but less strong that those produced by treatment with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. While the observed changes were considered by the authors as indicative of pre-malignancy, the lack of a consistent correlation between the effects of known carcinogens and non-carcinogenic analogues, and of consistent dose-response relationships, makes the significance of these effects difficult to assess. In a similar study, the transplacental effect of anthracene in mice was examined by oral administration of 8 mg of the substance per animal, followed by organ cultures of embryonic kidneys. Hyperplasia of individual tubules and outgrowths of atypical epithelial structures were observed in 15.6% of the tissues from animals given anthracene, compared to 1.8% seen in tissues from control animals."

            "Value": "Koc values ranging from 7.0X10+4 to 1.3X10+5 mL/g were measured for anthracene in an aqueous soil humic acid solution(1). A Koc of 2.86X10+4 mL/g was calculated for anthracene from its sorption coefficient in humic acid solutions(2). Sediment-porewater partition coefficients (log Koc) measured in sediments from an intertidal marsh ranged from 4.73 (fractional organic content (foc) 0.0039) to 5.86 (79.2% sand, 13.7% silt, 7.1% clay, and foc 0.0076)(3). Koc values ranging from 5000 to 3.5X10+4 were measured for anthracene on hematite and kaolinite coated with either peat humic acid or Suwanee humic acid(4). A Kp value (equilibrium-sorption coefficient) of 7.46 was determined in Borden soil (88% sand, 1% silt, 1% clay, 0.29% organic carbon)(5); this corresponds to a Koc of 2600(SRC) using a regression derived equation(6). A Ks value (equilibrium sorption constant) of 33.65 was measured in Eustis fine sand (13 g/kg clay, 32 g/kg silt, and 955 g/kg sand, organic carbon content of 3.9 g/kg)(7); this corresponds to a Koc of 8600(SRC) using a regression derived equation(6). According to a recommended classification scheme(8), these Koc values suggests that anthracene is expected to have slight to no mobility in soil(SRC)."

            "Value": "The possibility of leaching of anthracene from soil to groundwater will depend on soil type. The Koc value for anthracene is 26,000. This indicates that anthracene will be adsorped strongly to soil and the compound may degrade before it reaches groundwater. Filtration of polluted surface water containing anthracene through sandy soil at a residence time of 100 days did not completely eliminate anthracene in the filtered water. The passage of anthracene through the soil was explained as a breakthrough of the chemical because of the saturation of active sorption sites."
