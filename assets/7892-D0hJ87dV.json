            "Value": "AEROBIC: Indigenous soil microbes will biodegrade petroleum hydrocarbons under aerobic conditions(1). A quarter of the microorganisms isolated from gasoline-contaminated groundwater, most notably of the Nocardia sp., supported growth of 2-methylpentane(2). Generally iso-alkanes are significantly more resistant to microbial attack than n-alkanes(3). However, a soil microorganism, Corynebacterium sp. oxidized 2-methylpentane, at about the same rate as n-pentane, although at a significantly lower rate than n-hexane(3). A mean half-life of 5.9 days was reported for all detectable hydrocarbons in an aerobic biodegradation study of gasoline in water from a domestic sewage treatment plant(4). The biodegradation half-lives of the C6-saturates compound group (n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, methylcylcopentane and cyclohexane), determined from biodegradation tests with water accommodated fractions(WAF) of Statjofrd fresh oil, Aquila fresh oil, and Marine diesel in seawater at 13 \u00b0C, were 2.8, 1.7, and 3.5 days respectively (without correction for lag phase) (5). The mean half-life from results for all three oils was determined to be 2.7 days for the C6-saturates group(5). 2-Methylpentane, and 10 other components of gasoline were completely degraded in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum in less than 34 days(6). A mixture containing isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and cyclohexane, showed little degradation over the course of 30 days in a sediment/groundwater obtained from a contaminated jet fuel site in Oscoda, MI(7). 2-Methylpentane, present at 100 mg/L, reached 93% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in a screening test assessing biodegradation in water(8). Therefore, 2-methylpentane is confirmed to be readily biodegradable according to the standard test of the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI) (8)."

A sorption experiment using lignite samples resulted in a log Kd of 2.92 for 2-methylpentane(3)."
