It is a potent molluscicide and the active ingredient in most slug pellets used for crop protection. It has a role as a molluscicide and a fuel.",

            "Value": "The toxicologically active substance in metaldehyde intoxication is mainly the degradation product acetaldehyde, which is formed at a low pH in the stomach.  Other toxic products are probably also formed.  Acetaldehyde acts as a releasing factor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA).  It also competitively inhibits biogenic amine oxidation which, in turn, decreases 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of 5-HT by competitively inhibiting 5-HT-oxidation.  Acetaldehyde also increases monoamine oxidase activity and decreases central serotonin levels ..."
