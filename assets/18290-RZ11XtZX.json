The fungus Rhizoctonia solani was able to transform metobromuron by 70% after 6 days(2). In plants, the methyl and methoxy groups are split off and the urea moiety is further degrade to 4-bromoaniline(3). Presumably there is simultaneous ring hydroxylation and fission(3). Two fungi, Talaromyces wortmanii and Fusarium oxysporum metabolized 14C-labeled metobromuron, whereas neither Bascillus sphaericus nor the alga Chlorella vulgaris were able to degrade metobromuron(4)."

The average Koc value from eight soils of Czechoslovakia with organic matter contents ranging from 0.1-4.6% was 490(5).

Carrot ('Gold Pak') and coriander, moderately susceptible and resistant to these herbicides respectively, absorbed and translocated metobromuron but not chlorbromuron appreciably upwards. Neither herbicide, when applied to leaves, was significantly translocated in tomato or coriander. Coriander showed no appreciable metabolism of either compound. Extracts from tomato roots and tops showed significant radioactivity, indicating little metabolism. The lack of translocation of chlorbromuron to the tops of umbelliferous crops contributed to their tolerance. The differential tolerance of carrot and coriander to metobromuron compared to tomato could not be explained by differential uptake or metabolism.",
