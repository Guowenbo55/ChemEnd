Another study using COD, TOC, and UV with activated sludge found no degradation with cyanuric acid even with acclimated sludge(2). Cyanuric acid completely degraded in a study using s-triazine herbicide production wastes, HPLC and mixed (aerobic and anaerobic) bacteria cultures(4). Biodegradation of cyanuric acid by aerated activated sludge ranges from 14% at 8.7 mg/L DO and 5 hours, to 100% at 2.5 mg/L DO and 10 hours(5). After 16 days, 87% of labeled cyanuric acid had evolved as 14-CO2 and after 192 days, the percentage had increased to 99% in grab samples of aerobic soils (cyanuric acid concN 2.5 ppm)(3). In grab samples of saturated soil, 83% of labeled cyanuric acid had evolved as 14CO2 after 66 days, and after 375 days, the percentage increased to 99% (cyanuric acid concN 2.5 ppm)(3)."

            "Value": "AEROBIC: Cyanuric acid biodegrades readily under a wide variety of natural conditions, and particularly well in systems of either low or zero dissolved- oxygen levels, such as anaerobic activated sludge and sewage, soils, muds, and muddy streams and river waters, as well as ordinary aerated activated sludge systems with typically low (1 to 3 ppm) dissolved-oxygen levels(1). For example: CO2 evolution from 14C-labeled cyanuric acid on soils, muds and in natural waters ranges from 1% at 8 days to 116% at 23 days at room temperature(1). Cyanuric acid is a biodegradation product of melamine when the latter is subjected to a biodegradation test using Pseudomonas strain A(2)."
