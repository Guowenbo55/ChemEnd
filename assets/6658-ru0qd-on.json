The purpose of this study was to map, in 3 dimensions, the lesions induced by beta-beta'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the rat nasal cavity. Animals were administered IDPN (150 mg/kg, IP) or exposed via inhalation to MeI (100 ppm, 2 hours) or MMA (400 ppm, 4 hours) and sacrificed after 24 hours. Heads were decalcified, step-sections (1 every 400 um) cut and stained, and the severity of the epithelial lesion graded as mild (vacuolation and pyknosis), moderate (undulation and mild stripping), or marked (complete stripping). These grades were mapped onto a 3D-model of a rat nasal cavity using the KS400 imaging system (Imaging Associates, Thame, UK). Despite the different routes of exposure the lesions induced by the 3 compounds had very similar distributions, predominantly affecting the dorsal-medial aspects of the ethmoturbinates and, in the case of MMA, the organ of Rodolfo Masera. These results suggest that, with these chemicals, local bioactivation plays a more important role than dosimetry in determining lesion distribution."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Female F344 rats exposed to 200 ppm methyl methacrylate for 6 hr developed a lesion in the nasal olfactory epithelium which was characterized by degeneration and atrophy. The severity of the lesion was markedly reduced by pre-treatment of the rats with an intraperitoneal dose of 100 mg/kg bis-(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, an inhibitor of carboxylesterase enzymes, thus demonstrating that the lesion is caused by the carboxylesterase mediated metabolism of methyl methacrylate to methacrylic acid, an irritant and corrosive metabolite. The distribution of the carboxylesterases in nasal tissues has been investigated and the metabolism of methyl methacrylate to methacrylic acid has been compared in rat, hamster and human nasal tissue fractions in vitro. Histocytochemistry showed that the carboxylesterases are heavily localized in the sustentacular cells and Bowman's glands of the rat olfactory region, but are more generally distributed in human olfactory epithelium. Consistent with this, the enzyme activity in all three species was higher in fractions prepared from olfactory tissue than from respiratory tissue, 3-fold in rat and human and 12-fold in the hamster. The maximum rates (V(max)) of metabolism in rat and hamster olfactory tissue fractions were comparable, whereas those in human olfactory tissue fractions were at least 13-fold lower. The rate of metabolism in rat olfactory tissue was also comparable to that in rat liver whereas in humans, the rate in olfactory tissue was 500-fold lower than that in the liver. In respiratory tissues, the rate in humans was at least 6-fold lower than that in the rat. These results suggest that humans are significantly less sensitive than rodents to the nasal toxicity of methyl methacrylate."

Gavage administration of equimolar doses (2 mmol/kg) of methyl or ethyl acrylate in corn oil resulted in profound gastric toxicity in male F344 rats, while acrylic acid and n-butyl acrylate were without effect. Furthermore, gavage administration of equimolar doses of methyl propionate or ethyl propionate (saturated analogues of methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate, respectively) as well as methacrylic acid esters were without gastric toxicity. These results indicate that structural requirements for acrylate esters to cause gastric lesions include an intact ester moiety, a double bond, and no substitution at carbon number 2. Additional studies indicate that gastric toxicity may be attributed to the intact ester molecule or to metabolite(s) other than products of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis (acrylic acid and alcohol) and that gastric toxicity is dependent upon both acrylate ester concentration in dose vehicle and the lipophilicity of the dose vehicle (corn oil vs water)."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity/ Male and female Fischer 344 rats were exposed to MMA vapor 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 104 weeks at doses of 25, 100, and 400 ppm (70 male and 70 female per group).  A control group received no treatment ... The chronic inhalation studies on MMA were evaluated as follows. The lead effect of MMA in chronic inhalation studies in rodents is the nasal lesion characterized by inflammatory degeneration of the nasal epithelium, the target tissue at low concentrations being the olfactory epithelium; only at 400 ppm were effects seen in the anterior regions of the nose. A NOEL in the rat of 25 ppm has been established with very slight nasal lesions being observed at 100 ppm. This histological picture and the pattern of effect (i.e., olfactory tissue affected at the lower concentration) is consistent with toxicity arising from metabolism of the inhaled material by the olfactory tissue. Olfactory tissue in many species, including man, is known to have a considerable capacity to metabolize inhaled materials ... A purely irritant effect of the inhaled material would have give a reversed effect pattern, i.e., the anterior respiratory epithelium lined regions would have been affected at the lower concentration with a progression with increasing concentration to the posterior olfactory regions ... These effects are therefore probably related to the deposition of MMA in the upper respiratory tract and its subsequent hydrolysis by carboxylesterase enzymes to methacrylic acid in the nasal mucosa ... Localization and severity of the lesion in the olfactory epithelium is consistent with the greater esterase activity reported in the olfactory epithelium as compared with respiratory epithelium in rodents ... Release of methacrylic acid in this tissue is likely to cause severe local irritation leading ultimately to the observed histopathological effects. An additional factor governing tissue specificity may be due to different sensitivies to the acid metabolite or even further metabolism of the acid. This is suggested by inhalation studies conducted on acrylic and acetic acids, both inducing olfactory epithelium lesions ... There are significant morphological differences between species in the structure of the nasal cavity, and this is reflected in the differences in surface area normalized to minute ventilation reported between rodents (9 sq mm/mL/min) and humans (2 sq mm/mL/min) ..., which will result in differences in concentration of inhaled materials at the nasal tissue. In addition, rodents are obligate nose breathers whereas humans also breath through the mouth, the latter method of breathing being expected to reduce exposure of the nasal epithelium. Differing nasal flow patterns also influence the proportion of inhaled air passing over specific regions of the nasal cavity ... and hence the quantity of MMA vapor that might be absorbed. In the rat, ... a significant proportion of  inhaled air is directed onto the regions containing olfactory epithelium. In contrast, in man during the inhalatory phase of respiration, a small eddy is generated in the olfactory region, considered to provide sufficient flow for olfaction while protecting against injury ... While a higher airflow across the human olfactory epithelium occurs during the expiratory phase, the vapor concentration would be considerably reduced due to absorption in the lower respiratory tract. Taken together, these factors suggest that humans may be less sensitive than rodents to lesions of the nasal epithelium caused by MMA. Although no data are currently available on the species differences in olfactory tissue carboxylesterase activity, there are scant data available on species differences in respiratory enzyme complements ... A 35-fold lower activity of alpha-naphthylbutyrate carboxylesterase /has been demonstrated/ in human nasal respiratory tissue as compared to the rat, and although this supports the view that man is less likely to develop olfactory lesions as a result of inhaling MMA vapors, it must be stressed that these data were generated from human tissue samples taken at polyp biopsy that may not have been morphologically normal. It can therefore be concluded from the above that, while human nasal tissue will have the appropriate enzyme complement to metabolize MMA, the combination of the lower enzyme activities expected, together with differences in surface area to inspired flow and flow patterns, will result in a considerably reduced potential for the human to develop olfactory tissue lesions equivalent to those seen in the rat if exposed to similar concentrations of MMA vapor. In the original study, there were no treatment related clinical signs, no treatment related alteration in hematology and clinical chemistry or urinalysis, no consistent dose related effects on organ weight, and no consistent treatment related gross pathology. Histopathological investigations did not show treatment related increases in tumor incidence. Compound related histomorphological changes were restricted to a very slight increase in lesions of mild rhinitis in the mucosal lining of the nasal turbinates (slight serous exudate overlying the mucosa which occasionally contained polymorphonuclear leucocytes and distended submucosal glands, occasionally with accompanying pleocellular infiltrate). It was not possible on the strength of this study alone to determine if the rhinitis was a direct consequence of MMA exposure, or whether MMA exposure predisposed the animal to an increased incidence of spontaneous disease ... A review /was carried out/ of the histopathology of the nasal tissues taken from the rats in the /original/ study, which included taking sections deeper into the tissue blocks than was done in the original study. Of particular importance in this reanalysis was the differentiation between lesions of the olfactory epithelium and the respiratory epithelium, which had not been performed in the original histopathological examination. In rats exposed to 100 or 400 ppm, the olfactory region lining the dorsal meatus in the anterior region of the nasal cavity was primarily affected by the exposure to MMA and showed exposure related microscopic changes characterized by degeneration and/or atrophy of the epithelium and submucosal glands lining the dorsal meatus, basal cell hyperplasia, replacement of olfactory epithelium with ciliated (respiratory-like) epithelium, and inflammation of mucosa and/or submucosa. The severity of the lesions varied from minimal to slight at 100 ppm to slight to moderate at 400 ppm. One male rat from the 400 ppm exposure group showed severe effects. Based on this reassessment of the study, the author concluded that the nasal cavity is the target organ for MMA following exposure by the inhalation route and that the olfactory epithelium is the primary target tissue."

The rats were then exposed to an atmosphere containing 400 ppm MMA for 60 min. During the exposure period continuous multiple-unit activity (MUA) neuronal recordings were made of 10 different areas of the brain (hypothalamic nuclei: anterior, dorsal, lateral, ventromedial, and mammillary body; limbic nuclei: amygdaloid, dorsal hippocampal, and ventral hippocampal; cerebral nuclei: parietal cortex, cerebellar cortex). Exposure to MMA caused statistically significant decreases in the firing rate of cells in the lateral hypothalamus and ventral hippocampus. Decreases were observed in the dorsal hypothalamus and cerebellar cortex, but these were not statistically significant. The firing rates of cells in the remaining areas of the brain remained unchanged or increased (not statistically significant) in response to MMA exposure. Electroencephalographic recordings of the same areas gave no indication of the changes recorded by the in-dwelling electrodes. The firing rate of cells from the lateral hypothalamus and ventral hippocampus returned to normal following cessation of exposure. The authors concluded that the slowing of the firing rate in the cerebellar portion of the brain reflected decreased motor activity associated with anesthesia rather than exposure to MMA. Although the significance of these findings are uncertain, the authors tenuously linked them with reduced body weight gain seen in previous studies."
