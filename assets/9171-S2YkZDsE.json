            "Value": "AEROBIC: Biodegradation half-lives of 371 and 387 days were observed for chrysene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(1). No significant degradation of chrysene was observed in soil obtained from a former tar-oil refinery following 8 weeks of incubation in a percolator(2). However, when sand was contaminated with soil extracts containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including chrysene, and inoculated with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading mixed culture, the chrysene concentration was reduced from approx. 50 mg/kg soil to approx. 19 mg/kg soil(2). The inhibition of chrysene biodegradation was attributed to binding of chrysene with the soil(2). In a 240 day soil microcosm study, half-lives of 980, 1000, and 730 days at 10, 20, and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, were estimated for chrysene(3). In bench-scale biotreatability studies using a solid-phase bioremediation process (landfarming chambers containing sediment and soil collected from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL), the chrysene concentration was reduced from 114.0 to 53.4 mg/landfarming chamber in unamended surface soil; 114.0 to 46.2 mg/landfarming chamber in nutrient-amended surface soil; 1443.6 to 1146.6 mg/landfarming chamber in unamended sediment; and 1443.6 to 992.4 mg/landfarming chamber in nutrient-amended sediment following 12 weeks incubation(4). After 16 months incubation in biologically active soils containing 1-phenyldecane as a primary substrate, 84% of chrysene was recovered; 95% of chrysene was recovered from a poisoned control after 16 months incubation(5). Half-lives for chrysene ranged from 1000 days, using a synthetic mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons applied and incubated together in Kidman sandy loam soil, to 77 days in a mixture of oil refinery wastes applied to Kidman sandy loam soil(6).

Chrysene concentrations in dry months of 2008 were 1.62 and 9.19 ng/kg, and 0.41 and 25.57 ng/kg in wet months of 2009; samples were collected from crop lands in Mexico City, Mexico(4). Chrysene was detected at 5-82 ug/kg dry weight in all 20 soil samples from sites of the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network, with a mean concentration of 20.5 ug/kg dry weight(5). Chrysene was detected in soil samples obtained from a former wood impregnation plant and a former tar-oil refinery in Germany at 68.4 and 58.1 mg/kg soil, respectively(6). Chrysene/1,2-dibenzanthracene was detected in soil samples collected from 49 locations in Wales at 12-12,000 ug/kg dry weight(7). Chrysene was detected at 0.766-1560 ng/g dry weight (mean and median; 128 and 58.2 ng/g dry weight) in 201 soil samples from 32 different land types collected from across Great Britain(8). Archived soil samples from an agricultural experimental field in England had chrysene concentrations of 24, 16, 11, 18, 50, 87, 41, 120 and 78 ng/g from soil samples corresponding to respective years sampled of 1846, 1881, 1893, 1914, 1944, 1956, 1966, 1980 and 1986(9). In 216 soil samples collected from agricultural fields in 2005 from Poland, chrysene was detected at 4-677 ug/kg(10). Chrysene was detected at 149 ug/kg in soil samples collected in Birmingham, UK and at 62.9 and 5.71 ug/kg in samples collected form Lahore, Pakistan(11). The mean concentration of chrysene was reported as 4.07, 3.19, 3.03 and 2.19 ug/g in 319 soil samples collected from industrial, roadside, residential and agricultural land use areas of Agra, India, respectively(12)."
