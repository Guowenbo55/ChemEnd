            "Value": "Oxychlordane was detected at a concentration of 4 ppb in a wild Canadian Bison(1). Bats obtained from caves in Mexico contained oxychlordane at concentration of 0.0-0.3 ppm(2). Bats obtained from caves in Missouri contained oxychlordane at concentrations of 0.4-4.6 ug/g(3). Eggs from Canadian seabirds and gulls contained oxychlordane at concentrations of 0.02-0.20 mg/kg(4,5). Oxychlordane was detected in falcon eggs in Colorado and New Mexico at concentrations of 0.49 ppm in 1979 and 0.09 ppm in 1982(6). Mallard ducks released near a sewage treatment plant in Bloomington IN, had undetectable levels of oxychlordane at the time of their release but average concentrations of 0.11 ug/g and 0.18 ug/g were detected after 52 and 100 days of exposure respectively(7). Ambient levels of oxychlordane were measured in seals (170 ng/g), polar bears (1600 ng/g), porpoises (250 ng/g), penguins (16 ng/g), squid (1.2 ng/g), gulls (29 ng/g) and various species of fish (0.1-160 ng/g)(8). Oxychlordane was detected in Falcon eggs in California at concentrations of 13-86 mg/kg(9)."
