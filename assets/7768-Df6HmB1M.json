            "Value": "The activated sludge treatment of wastewater containing caprolactam from a Nylon 6 manufacturing plant was investigated by basic studies and by operating a full scale treatment plant. Activated sludges were obtained from municipal and industrial wastewater sources or were prepared by mixing caprolactam utilizing bacteria (Bacillus and Achromobacter) with municipal activated sludge. Bulking phenomena were observed in the acclimatization of ordinary activated sludges even when started from very low concentrations of caprolactam. The activated sludge synthesized from caprolactam utilizing bacteria showed better results with respect to sludge volume index, biochemical oxygen demand removal, and transparency of treated water. Wastewater from the Nylon 6 manufacturing plant, which contained caprolactam, was treated by this synthesized activated sludge in a bench scale apparatus consisting of a 4 cu m aeration basin and a 1.4 cu m sedimentation basin. The optimum biochemical oxygen demand loading was estimated to be 0.35 to 0.40 kg/kg of mixed liquor sludge solids/day. Production of excess activated sludge was 10% of the biochemical oxygen demand load. A wastewater treatment facility consisting of a 2500 cu m aeration basin and 1250 cu m sedimentation basin was constructed near the nylon 6 manufacturing plant to process 5000 cu m of wastewater (biochemical oxygen demand of 300 to 400 mg/l) per day. The treatment plant produces effluent with a biochemical oxygen demand below 10 mg/l."

            "Value": "Caprolactam (50 ug/ml) was biologically degraded in grab samples in 21 days(1). In sterilized stream and lake water samples 35-50% of the caprolactam underwent primary degradation(1) to aminocaproic acid, achieved by hydrolysis(2). In natural (not sterilized) waters, 75-100% of the chemical underwent primary degradation. Mineralization (complete degradation, as measured by %CO2 evolution) of caprolactam was not observed in any sterile water samples, but was observed in all non-sterile samples. After a 21 day incubation, grab samples at initial concentrations of 40.4 ug/ml were degraded as follows (as measured by %CO2 evolution): sterilized stream water: <5%; unsupplemented stream water: <5%; stream water plus sediment: 8%; stream water with yeast extract: 36%; sterilized lake water: <5%; unsupplemented lake water: 5%; lake water plus sediment: 10%; lake water with yeast extract: 50%.

After 21 days, nearly all the caprolactam at all temperatures was degraded. With lake water grab samples amended with yeast extract and a caprolactam concentration of 40.4 ppm, 8, 72, and 79% CO2 evolution was observed when incubated at 10, 20, and 25 \u00b0C, respectively.

In rats dosed on days 6-15 of gestation with 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of caprolactam, the maternal survival rate was significantly lower in the high dose group and implantation efficiencies were slightly lower in the 100 and 1000 mg/groups (but not the 500 mg/kg) than in the control. The incidence of fetal death was comparable for all groups, and the incidence of fetal viability was considerably lower in the high dose group (but not the mid or low) than in the control group. Visceral anomalies and one visceral variant were observed in one 100 mg/kg and one 500 mg/kg pup, respectively. The anomalies included exencephaly, an incomplete left eyelid, microphthalmia (right), and a protruding tongue. No skeletal anomalies were observed. It was concluded that caprolactam at levels up to at least 500 mg/kg of body weight produced no teratogenic effects in the Fischer 344 rats. In rabbits receiving 50, 150 or 250 mg/kg caprolactam on days 6-28 of gestation, the pregnancy rate in all groups was at least 80%. The numbers of corpora lutea, live and dead fetuses, resorptions, the sex ratio and the pre- and post-implantation losses were not significantly different among the test and control groups. The incidence of major malformations and of minor skeletal anomalies was unaffected by treatment with caprolactam. Maternal weights were depressed in the group receiving 250 mg/kg. Treatment of a separate group with a positive control substance (6-aminonicotinamide) resulted in significantly (p less than 0.001) increased incidences of major malformations, minor visceral anomalies and minor skeletal anomalies. Maternal toxicity in terms of mortality was observed in pregnant rabbits treated with caprolactam at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day. Fetotoxicity was evidenced by lower fetal weights at the 150 and 250 mg/kg/day levels, and an increased incidence of thirteenth ribs was observed at the 250 mg/kg/day dose level. Neither embryotoxicity nor teratogenicity occurred at any dose level."

The animals were dosed with 2 mg/kg of colchicine exactly 1 hour prior to sacrifice. No chromosomal aberrations were produced under these experimental conditions by caprolactam. The frequency of cells with breaks and gaps remained at the control level in all three sampling groups. The mitotic indices were reduced at the 30 and 48 hr intervals indicating a cytotoxic effect. Under similar conditions, benzo(a)pyrene, which served as a positive control, significantly increased the aberrations rates at a dose of 63 mg/kg. The sampling time for benzo(a)pyrene treated animals was 30 hr after treatment."

Control groups consisted of 50 undosed rats and 50 undosed mice of each sex. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, caprolactam was not carcinogenic for F344 rats or B6C3F1 mice.

            "Value": "This study was designed to assess the potential subchronic inhalation toxicity of caprolactam when administered as a 3 micron aerosol from an aqueous solution to Sprague Dawley CD rats (10/sex/group) via whole body exposure. The study was enhanced with the inclusion of motor activity measurements and a functional observational battery to assess the neurotoxic potential of caprolactam. The rats were exposed at least 65 times over a 13 week period for 6 hr per day, 5 days per week, to target concentrations (3 microns, mass median aerodynamic diameter) of 0, 25, 75, and 250 mg/cu m. An additional 10 animals/sex/group were similarly exposed and then held for a 4 week recovery period. Exposure levels were determined gravimetrically six times daily; one daily sample was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. No deaths were observed in the study during the exposure or recovery periods. Treatment related responses such as labored breathing and nasal discharge were seen during many of the exposures. Similar responses as well as moist rales were seen during the nonexposure periods during the 13 weeks of exposure. However, these responses abated during the 4 week recovery period. There were no clearly treatment related responses observed with ophthalmoscopic examinations body weight measurements, food consumption measurements, neurobehavioral evaluations, clinical pathology evaluations, organ weight measurements, or macroscopic pathology examinations. Microscopic findings that were considered related to exposure to the test material were seen in the nasoturbinal tissues (hypertrophy/hyperplasia of goblet cells in the respiratory mucosa and intracytoplasmic eosinophilic material in epithelial cells of the olfactory mucosa) of the two higher exposure group animals and in the laryngeal tissues (squamous/squamoid metaplasia/hyperplasia of the pseudostratified columnar epithelium covering the ventral seromucous gland) of all three exposure group animals. These changes were considered to be adaptive responses to an irritant (caprolactam). The keratinization of the metaplastic epithelium in the larynx was considered to be an adverse effect. By the end of the 4 week recovery period, there was complete regression of the keratinization in the larynx, but recovery of the adaptive nasoturbinal effects had not completely resolved. In conclusion, the whole body exposure of Sprague Dawley rats to caprolactam as a respirable aerosol for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 15 weeks at gravimetrically determined levels of 24, 70, and 243 mg/cu m resulted in respiratory tract effects (laryngeal) at the highest exposure level with complete recovery within 4 weeks postexposure. The results indicate that the no observed adverse effect level for caprolactam is 70 mg/cu m, based on upper respiratory effects, with 243 mg/cu m representing a no observed effect level for systemic toxicity, neurotoxicity, and lower respiratory tract effects."

            "Value": "Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(1), the Koc for caprolactam is estimated to be 57(SRC). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that caprolactam is expected to have high mobility in soil."
