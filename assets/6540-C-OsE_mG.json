Most of the other PFRs showed trophic dilution in both food webs.

The OPFRs, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), were most frequently quantified with concentrations ranging from <0.07 to 9.8 ng/g (ww). Levels of TBOEP were highest in fish from the Great Lakes region while TCEP was detected only in fish from the northernmost lakes in /the Canadian/ network. Concentrations of the cyclic siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6), were above quantitation limits in all fish.
