The exposed animals that died and those which survived up to 8 days postexposure were autopsied to determine any resulting pathology. The high concentration exposures mainly produced pulmonary damage in the bronchioles and alveoli. Bronchiolar cells showed swelling, distention, and cytoplasmic vacuolation with an exudate containing erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and leukocytes. Swelling of the alveolar walls was noted. Alveolar spaces were found to contain a sero-fibrinous exudate, endothelial leukocytes, and fine granules. At the lower exposure cementations, the pulmonary reactions were similar to those at the higher concentrations, but to a lesser degree. In some cases, congestion of the kidneys and liver caused by large numbers of erythrocytes were also observed. At the lower concentration, kidney effects were the most prominent with apparent compression fo the capillary tufts and tubular damage. There was also central liver lobule necrosis in many cases."

In women, hormonal influences, such as \"unopposed\" estrogenic stimulus, have been implicated as important etiologic factors in uterine cancer. BE, however, does not affect the serum concentrations of sex hormones in female B6C3F1 mice and the mechanism of BE-induced uterine carcinogenesis still remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the estrogenic effects of BE on the uterus of ovariectomized B6C3F1 mice and on Ishikawa cells. Groups of 6 mice were given daily s.c. injections of 0, 100, 500 or 1000 mg BE/kg for 3 consecutive days. Mice treated with 17beta-estradiol served as positive controls. Mice were necropsied 24 hr after the final injection, and uteri were weighed and examined histologically and immunohistochemically along with the vagina. Changes observed in the estrogen-treated mice included increased uterine weights, edema and inflammation of the endometrium, increased epithelial layers of the uterine and vaginal lumens and keratinization of the vaginal epithelium. In the BE-treated mice, no such changes occurred; however, immunohistochemical staining of the uterus revealed a significant increase in immunoexpression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in the two higher dose groups. Analysis of mRNA also showed slightly increased uterine ERalpha expression in these groups. Upregulated expression of ERalpha was confirmed in BE-treated Ishikawa cells, in which Western blotting analyses identified an intense signal at approximately 66 kDa, which is consistent with ERalpha. These data suggest that upregulated expression of ERalpha may be important in the induction of endometrial neoplasms in BE-treated mice."

These chemicals are nearly unique in this regard among the nearly 400 chemicals studied by the National Toxicology Program, and the reasons for this carcinogenic activity are unclear. The possible relationship of changes in blood concentrations of sex hormones to this response was evaluated by examining the estrous cycle of mice prior to and during a 21 day exposure to concentrations of the haloethanes which resulted in the tumorigenic response in the 2 year studies. Serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were determined at the termination of the exposures and compared to exposure group and stage of the estrous cycle. No consistent patterns of change were found in estrous cyclicity or in blood concentrations of sex hormones. Thus, the findings suggest that early changes in circulating sex hormones are not important contributing factors in the uterine neoplasia caused by these chemicals."
