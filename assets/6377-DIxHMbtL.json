Urine was collected at time points up to 4 days p.d. and the toxicological response of the different animal models to PI compared using (1)H NMR spectroscopy of urine, renal histopathology, and urinary assays for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GT). The renal papillae of both F344 and SD rats showed extensive necrotic lesions 4 days post-dosing and in some cases sloughing of the papilla. However, only slight renal papillary necrosis (RPN) was observed in Mastomys treated with 20 uL/kg PI and, although slight to moderate damage was observed at 30 uL/kg, PI-treated Mastomys showed substantially less RPN than either group of PI-treated rats. (1)H NMR urinalysis showed that PI treatment caused a decrease in the urinary concentrations of succinate (0-24 hr p.d.) and citrate (24-48 hr p.d.) and an increase in creatine (0-48 hr p.d.) in /the 3/ animal models. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (24-48 hr) and 2-oxoglutarate concentrations decreased initially following the administration of PI and then rose above control levels. The (1)H NMR-detected urinary biochemical effects of PI in all three models were similar. However, taurine concentrations were elevated in the urine of Mastomys following PI treatment, perhaps indicating a degree of liver damage, whereas taurinuria was not seen in either SD or F344 rats. ..."

Injection of proyleneimine (10 uL/kg body wt) produced a small rise in N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, minor histological damage but no change in urine volume. Six rats were injected with 20 uL/kg body weight, and urine was collected over the following 16 days. An immediate increase in urine volume, osmolality together with a concomitant decrease in specific gravity. A small increase in creatinine excretion and a more marked increase in the sodium and potassium content of urine after the administration of the nephrotoxin was noted. N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity increased immediately and peaked on day 3, the activity remained elevated until day 12 when it fell to near normal levels. The activity of both beta-D-galactosidase and beta-D-glucosidase increased 9 days after administration of the nephrotoxin. In contrast, no consistent change was found in the excretion of the brush border marker enzymes, leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Proteinuria increased sharply the day after injection and remained abnormal. Increased urinary albumin excretion and the predominance of low molecular weight proteins was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

For acute studies, a single dose of each compound was administered by gavage for up to 14 days. Gross necropsies were performed on dead and sacrificed animals. Subchronic studies were initiated to delineate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) over a longer time period; five distinct doses of each compound were mixed in the diet, or given twice weekly by stomach tube, to groups of three animals each over 30 days, followed by 30 days of observation for detection of delayed toxicity. In the chronic studies rats were given the compound continuously in the diet or by gavage twice weekly, at the MTD, and one half the MTD for 18 months. The animals were observed for 6 months before termination of the study. Two groups of positive control animals received the carcinogen N-2-fluorenylacetamide (NFA) in the diet at 80 or 250 ppm to check the response of the strain to a known carcinogen at different doses. All rats were necropsied and the tissues were examined histopathologically. Avadex, bis-(2-chloroethyl)-ether, the potassium salt of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dithiocarbamic-acid, ethylene-carbonate, and semicarbazide-hydrochloride were not carcinogenic under the test conditions.
