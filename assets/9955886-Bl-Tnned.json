The results showed that approximately 20% of applied trifloxysulfuron was absorbed within 4 hours of application, reaching a total absorption of 43% after 72 hours. The translocation of trifloxysulfuron within the tobacco plants was limited, with not more than 4% of the herbicide moving out of the treated leaves. The partitioning of radioactivity showed that less than 1.9% of the absorbed trifloxysulfuron accumulated in any specific plant part. The low translocation rates observed in tobacco were consistent with other studies on trifloxysulfuron, where the majority of the herbicide remained in the treated leaves",

Laboratory studies showed that greater absorption of radiolabeled trifloxysulfuron occurred in leaves 4 hours after treatment (HAT) when trifloxysulfuron was tank-mixed with malathion compared to trifloxysulfuron applied alone at the 3-to 4-leaf stage. Translocation of trifloxysulfuron to plant tissue above and below the treated leaf was also greater with the tank-mixture. However, increased foliar phytotoxicity (leaf burning) was observed 24 and 96 HAT with trifloxysulfuron tank-mixed with malathion compared to trifloxysulfuron applied alone. These findings suggest that malathion could potentially reduce the rate of trifloxysulfuron metabolism in cotton.",
