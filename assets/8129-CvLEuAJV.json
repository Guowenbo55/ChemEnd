At baseline, no sustained (>30 s) AF could be induced in any of the 12 tissues. However, after 2 microM heptanol infusion, sustained AF was induced in 9 of 12 tissues (P < 0.001).

            "Value": "... The experiments investigated the effects of heptanol on isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Heptanol inhibited both pressure generation and electrical conduction. These effects were completely reversible ... Low concentrations of heptanol (less than 0.3 mM) caused small but significant increases in the delay between the stimulus (delivered to the basal septum) artifact and local activation of the left ventricle, as measured from bipolar electrogram (BEG) recordings. There was a steep increase in the latency between stimulus and left-ventricular activation at concentrations of heptanol above 0.3 mM ... Heptanol decreased repolarization duration, measured from the activation recovery interval (ARI) of BEGs, and monophasic action potential duration at 70% repolarization (MAPD70). Heptanol also reduced left-ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and the maximum rates of contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle; these effects were concentration dependent and reversible. Changes in ARIs, LVDP and the maximum rates of change of pressure lacked the steep response to 0.3 to 1.0 mM heptanol shown by the latency ... During premature stimulation protocols arrhythmias could be induced in hearts perfused with 0.1 to 0.3 mM heptanol but not at higher concentrations."

The relationship of the hydroxylating process to protein concentration and to the formation of the three main alcoholic products, namely 1-heptanol (111706), 2-heptanol (543497), and 3-heptanol (589822), were linear up to 1mg/4 minutes. Treatment of rats with phenobarbitol (50066) for 2 days enhanced hydroxylation and formation of 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol and 4-heptanol about 4 fold, but 1-heptanol was increased only 60 percent. In contrast, 3,4-benzpyrene depressed the formation of 1-heptanol to about 70 percent and increased the formation of 3-heptanol and 4-heptanol slightly. Carbon-monoxide inhibited formation of 1-heptanol. Similar results were obtained with metyrapone."

The role of intercellular communication through connexin43 (Cx43)-derived gap junction channels to bladder overactivity following partial urethral outflow obstruction of 3-day to 6-wk duration /was evaluated in female rats/. Cx43 mRNA and protein expression were barely detectable by Northern or Western blots, respectively, in the detrusor layer of normal bladders, but bands were found with both techniques after 6 wk of obstruction. Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between the duration of obstruction and Cx43 mRNA transcript levels, such that after 6 wk of obstruction, Cx43 transcript levels were approximately 15-fold greater than initial control values. The absolute amount of Cx43 mRNA in the bladder apparently increased by approximately 75-fold. 6 wk of obstruction was also associated with a significant increase in spontaneous bladder contractions between micturitions. The amplitude of these contractions was significantly reduced by heptanol given intravesically. Carbachol-precontracted bladder strips from obstructed animals were more sensitive to heptanol-induced relaxation (100 microM) than their unobstructed counterparts (n = 6; P < 0.01). The tetrodotoxin-resistant portion of the EFS-induced contraction was greater in the obstructed than in the unobstructed animals, and this portion of the contractile response was more sensitive to heptanol-induced relaxation in obstructed than unobstructed bladders (n = 7; P < 0.01)."
