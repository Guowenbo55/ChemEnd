    "Description": "Aldicarb is the oxime carbamate resulting from the addition of 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfanyl)propanaldoxime to methyl isocyanate. A member of the class of oxime carbamate insecticides, aldicarb is a mixture of E and Z isomers; it is not known which isomer is more active. It has a role as a carbamate insecticide, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an acaricide and a nematicide. It is functionally related to a 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfanyl)propanal oxime and a methyl isocyanate.",

The degradation of aldicarb in soil followed first-order kinetics, with half-lives (t1/2) of 12.0 and 2.7 days in sterile and non-sterile soil, respectively, indicating the significant role of microorganisms in its degradation. In the presence of plants, aldicarb degraded more rapidly, with t1/2 values of 1.6, 1.4, and 1.7 days in soil grown with corn, mung bean, and cowpea, respectively. The comparison between plant-promoted degradation and plant uptake revealed that the enhanced removal of aldicarb in plant-grown soil was primarily attributed to plant-promoted degradation in the rhizosphere.",

Aldicarb exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on egg hatch compared to aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone. The inhibition of hatching at high concentrations was associated with delays in molting processes, lack of larval movement within the egg, and delays in embryonic development. Nematode motility was reduced at 10, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/ml of aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide solutions, as well as at 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml of aldicarb sulfone. Male development was hindered at 10 \u03bcg/ml and almost completely inhibited at 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml of the three chemicals. In greenhouse tests, female development and reproduction on citrus seedling roots were suppressed by aldicarb at a rate of 2.6 \u03bcg/ml and completely inhibited at 10.6 \u03bcg/ml of soil solution over a 50-day experimental period. Under field conditions, there was minimal systemic movement of aldicarb into roots beyond the treated areas. Aldicarb reduced the population of nematode larvae and female adults in the second year after the second treatment. There were no significant differences in egg hatch and sex ratio of citrus nematodes between treated and untreated roots.",
