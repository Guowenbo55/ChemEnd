Dimethylamine was biodegraded 69-89% in three Saskatchewan soils during a 7 day incubation period(2). In a screening study, dimethylamine completely degraded from a starting concentration of 10 mg/L with both an activated sludge and freshwater/sediment inoculum(3); after 5 days incubation, 70 and 80% of Theoretical BOD was consumed in the activated sludge and the sediment, respectively(3). Another screening study that employed an activated sludge inoculum reported 100% degradation in 6 and 12 days when the initial dimethylamine concentration was 20 mg/L and 135 mg/L, respectively(4). In a laboratory activated sludge unit, dimethylamine was completely removed from inflows of up to 135 mg/L with retention times of 4 hr indicating that it should be readily degraded in biological treatment plants(4). The half-life in Vistula River water (Warsaw, Poland) was 1.6 days after a 0.3 day lag(4). Dimethylamine is confirmed to be biodegradable according to the standard test of the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI) that employs a mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater, soil, and sludge(5-7). When 250 ppm dimethylamine was added to a fine sand loam and sandy soil amended with sewage and nitrite-N, 50% degradation occurred in 2 days in the sand loam, while 20% degradation occurred in the sandy soil(8). N-nitrosodimethylamine was formed in the degradation(8). 50 to >90% degradation occurred in four silt loam or loam soils within 14 days(9)."

Groups of 3 or 4 rats and mice were exposed for 10 minutes to concentrations of DMA ranging from 49 to 1576 ppm during which time the respiratory rate was monitored and recorded. Sensory irritation concentration-response curves were obtained and RD50 values (concentration which elicits a 50% decrease in respiratory rate) were determined to be 573 and 511 ppm for rats and mice, respectively. In another set of experiments seven groups of male rats were exposed to concentrations of DMA ranging from 600 to 6119 ppm for six hours. Mortality counts were made during and for 48 hours post exposure. The six hour LC50 was determined to be 4540 ppm.

Male and female F-344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed by inhalation to 0, 10, 50, or 175 ppm dimethylamine (DMA) for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 12 months. Groups of 9-10 male and female rats and mice were necropsied after 6 and 12 months of exposure. No male mice were sacrificed at 12 months due to a high incidence of early deaths in that group. The mean body weight gain of rats and mice exposed to 175 ppm DMA was depressed to approximately 90% of control after 3 weeks of exposure. The only other treatment-related changes were concentration-related lesions in the nasal passages. Two distinct locations in the nose were affected: the respiratory epithelium in the anterior nasal passages, and the olfactory epithelium, especially that lining the anterior dorsal meatus. There was focal destruction of the anterior nasoturbinate and nasal septum, local inflammation, and focal squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium in rats and mice. Mild goblet cell hyperplasia was observed only in rats. The olfactory epithelium exhibited extensive loss of sensory cells with less damage to sustentacular cells. There was also loss of olfactory nerves, hypertrophy of Bowman's glands, and distension of the ducts of these glands by serocellular debris in regions underlying degenerating olfactory epithelium. At the 175-ppm exposure level, rats had more extensive olfactory lesions than mice, with hyperplasia of small basophilic cells adjacent to the basement membrane being present in rats but not mice. After 12 months of exposure to 10 ppm DMA, minimal loss of olfactory sensory cells and their axons in olfactory nerve bundles was observed in the nasal passages of a few rats and mice. These results indicate that the olfactory sensory cell is highly sensitive to the toxic effects of DMA, with minor lesions being produced in rodents even at the current threshold limit value of 10 ppm."

Some nitrogenous compounds showed slight mutagenic activity after pyrolysis at 300 degrees C for 20 min, although none of the compounds tested showed any mutagenic activity after pyrolysis at 300 degrees C for 3 min."

            "Value": "/ALTERNATIVE and IN VITRO TESTS/ Long-term exposure and inhalation of odorous compounds from poultry manure can be harmful to farm workers and the surrounding residents as well as animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytotoxicity and IC50 values of common odorous compounds such as ammonium, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, butyric acid, phenol, and indole in the chick liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line LMH (Leghorn Male Hepatoma), in vitro, using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and PrestoBlue cytotoxicity assays. The cells were microscopically examined for any morphological changes post treatment. Dimethylamine exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effect on LMH cells with an IC50 value of 0.06% and 0.04% after an exposure of 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively. Both ammonium and trimethylamine had comparable cytotoxicity and their IC50 values were 0.08% and 0.04% after 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively. Of note, indole had the lowest cytotoxicity as the majority of cells were viable even after 72 hr exposure. Thus, the IC50 for indole was not calculated. Results achieved from both MTT and PrestoBlue assays were comparable. Moreover, the morphological changes induced by the tested odors in LMH cells resulted in monolayer destruction, cytoplasm vacuolization, chromatin condensation, and changes in nucleus and cell shape. Our study showed harmful effects of odorous compounds in chick tissues."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Dimethylamine (DMA) is a highly water soluble gas with many industrial applications. Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxilloturbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and \"whirlpool-like\" formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ This review compiles available information on the concentrations, sources, fate and toxicity of amines and amine-related compounds in surface waters, including rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands and seawater. There is a strong need for this information, especially given the emergence of amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture technologies, which may represent a new and significant source of amines to the environment. We identify a broad range of anthropogenic and natural sources of amines, nitrosamines and nitramines to the aquatic environment, and identify some key fate and degradation pathways of these compounds. There were very few data available on amines in surface waters, with reported concentrations often below detection and only rarely exceeding 10 ug/L. Reported concentrations for seawater and reservoirs were below detection or very low, while for lakes and rivers, concentrations spanned several orders of magnitude. The most prevalent and commonly detected amines were methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), ethylamine (EA), diethylamine (DEA) and monoethanolamine (MEAT). The paucity of data may reflect the analytical challenges posed by determination of amines in complex environmental matrices at ambient levels. We provide an overview of available aquatic toxicological data for amines and conclude that at current environmental concentrations, amines are not likely to be of toxicological concern to the aquatic environment, however, the potential for amines to act as precursors in the formation of nitrosamines and nitramines may represent a risk of contamination of drinking water supplies by these often carcinogenic compounds. More research on the prevalence and toxicity of amines, nitrosamines and nitramines in natural waters is necessary before the environmental impact of new point sources from carbon capture facilities can be adequately quantified."

According to a classification scheme(3), this Koc data suggests that dimethylamine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil."
