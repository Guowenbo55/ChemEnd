            "Value": "SEDIMENT: The concn of monobutyltin species in sediment (upper 2 cm) from Toronto Harbor (4 sites) was trace-0.08 mg Sn/kg dry weight(1). The concn of monobutyltin in sediment from two harbors along the Rhine River in Germany were 27 and 34 ng Sn/g dry wt(2). Sediment from a tributary of the Rhine with a high input of sewage contained 547 ng Sn/g dry wt(2). Intertidal sediments at a restricted site downstream from the shipyards in the Sado estuary, Portugal reached levels of 2100 ng/g dry wt for monobutyltin, over an order of a magnitude higher than samples taken in March(3). This has been ascribed to the cleaning of ships in spring and points up the large seasonal variability in anthropgenic organotin levels. Fluvial, intertidal, and marine levels of monobutyltin at other sites in the Sado Estuary were 5.5-20, 5.5-181, and 6.3-14 ng/g."
