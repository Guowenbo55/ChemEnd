Reductive dechlorination of pentachlorobenzene to lower chlorinated benzenes occurs under anaerobic conditions(2,3), but there are conflicting data regarding the rates of biodegradation. A culturally enriched anaerobic microbial consortium was shown to biodegrade pentachlorobenzene with a half-life of several days, but the native anaerobic microbial population (from sediment from Lake Ketelmeer, The Netherlands) was shown to biodegrade polychlorinated benzenes only after a period of a few years(2). Pentachlorobenzene was biodegraded by an acclimated anaerobic sediment slurry obtained from the Tsurumi River, Japan with a biodegradation half-life of 17 days and the following biodegradation products were detected: 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene; > 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene; > 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene; > 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene; > 1,3-dichlorobenzene; > 1,2-dichlorobenzene; > monochlorobenzene(3).

Particularly, Pteris vittata, a fern species, exhibited a benzene-tolerant behavior by restricting the translocation of benzene from the roots to the aerial parts and by minimizing the absorption of the pollutant from the soil. Benzene was predominantly retained in the roots of P. vittata, with minimal translocation to the leaves (<2%). In contrast, Impatiens walleriana actively absorbed and translocated benzene from the soil, indicating a different response to benzene exposure. However, Brachiaria brizantha, another species studied, did not demonstrate benzene tolerance and ultimately perished during the treatment. The study also examined changes in stomatal density, which was influenced by benzene exposure and associated with reduced leaf area due to lower water availability. "
