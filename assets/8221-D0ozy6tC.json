Given sufficient time in contact with adapted microbial species under conditions otherwise non-limiting, the complete disappearance of 1-octadecanol as identifiable molecular species will occur(2)."

The reactivity of the fatty alcohols with cetrimide decreased with increasing chain length although branching on the tetradecanol and hexadecanol resulted in a higher reactivity. Adding 1-octadecanol to 1-hexadecanol resulted in an increased reactivity rising to a maximum for mixtures containing 20-40% w/w 1-octadecanol."

The unsaturated alcohols (oleyl, linoleyl, and linolenyl) and the secondary alcohol (pentadecan-2-ol)  were considerably less effective growth inhibitors. Stearic and palmitic acids were also ineffective."

Wax esters and acyl moieties of glycerolipids contained most of the 14C-activity from 3 to 6 hr, because octadecanol was partly oxidized to stearate. Ether moieties were only weakly labeled. After 40 hr, 1-0-alkyl and 1-0-alk-1'-enyl diacylglycerols as well as 1-0-alkyl and 1-0-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines contained nearly all of the radioactivity. Most of the label in the neutral ether lipids was located in the alkyl ether side chain, whereas, in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction, most of the label was found in the alkenyl ether side chain."
