Novel results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, as well as the established environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT, were able to bind specifically to the hER with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities for the hER than that of estradiol. In contrast, only o,p'-DDT, but not p,p'-DDT, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. Moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the DDT isomers and metabolites could transcriptionally activate the hER, demonstrated that an o,p'-DDT metabolite could transactivate the hER or LexA-hER fusion protein with just a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that bound the hER in vitro triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacZ reporter gene in the yeast systems. Furthermore, the DDT isomers and metabolites that transactivated the hER elicited an additive response when given together or with estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that triggered transcription of the yeast expression-reporter systems also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the hER. Thus, in MCF-7 cells and in yeast expression-reporter systems, certain DDT isomers and metabolites act directly as agonists and transactivate the hER at concentrations found in human tissues."

None of the DDT metabolites functioned as hPR agonists. Whole cell competition binding assays using T47D cells indicated that the inhibitory effects of DDT metabolites on progesterone-dependent activites may occur through both hPR-dependent and hPR-independent pathways.

Acute exposures to o,p'-DDD inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion while cell viability decreased significantly only at the highest concentration tested (200 microM o,p'-DDD). Stimulation of cortisol secretion with a cAMP analogue (dibutyryl-cAMP) was inhibited at a higher concentration than that needed to inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis in cells exposed to o,p'-DDD. Forskolin-stimulated cortisol secretion and cAMP production, and NaF-stimulated cAMP production were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by o,p'-DDD. In contrast, basal cortisol secretion was stimulated while basal cAMP production was unaffected by o,p'-DDD. Pregnenolone-stimulated cortisol secretion was enhanced by o,p'-DDD at a physiologically relevant pregnenolone concentration, while o,p'-DDD inhibited cortisol secretion when a pharmacological concentration of pregnenolone was used. /These/ results suggest that the cAMP generation step is a target in o,p'-DDD-mediated disruption of ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis in rainbow trout but that other downstream targets such as steroidogenic enzymes responsible for cortisol synthesis might also be affected."

Liver tumors appeared in 1% of the untreated females and 100% of the treated females. Exposure to p,p'-DDD moderately incr the incidence of liver tumors in males only and markedly incr the incidence of lung tumors in both sexes. Exposure to both chemicals combined resulted in a marked incr in the incidence of liver tumors in both sexes and in the early appearance of such tumors. The storage levels of these metabolites were higher in the fat tissue than in the liver or kidneys, and the storage concn of p,p'-DDE was higher than that of p,p'-DDD following the same exposure levels."
