N,N-Dimethylformamide, present at 100 mg/L, reached 4.4% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(2). Aerobic grab sample data for N,N-dimethylformamide in sea water showed a mineralization rate of <3% in 24 hours for initial concentration of 10 ug/L and 100 ug/L(3). However, 20% of N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 0.1 ug/L was mineralized in 24 hrs(3). All samples were adjusted to sterilized controls(3). Aqueous screening test data demonstrated that dimethylformamide was easily removed by sewage treatment facilities upon acclimation(4). Wastewater from a polyimide synthesis operation at Kansas City, MO contained N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 65,500 mg/L before entering a bench scale biological treatment system(5). At feed rates of 90 lb/day/1000 cu ft, effluent from the biological reactor contained N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of <10 mg/L(5).

            "Value": "N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is an organic solvent extensively used in industries such as synthetic leather, fibers and films, and induces liver toxicity and carcinogenesis. Despite a series of experimental and clinical reports on DMF-induced liver failure, the mechanism of toxicity is yet unclear. This study investigated whether DMF in combination with a low dose of hepatotoxicant enhances hepatotoxicity, and if so, on what mechanistic basis. Treatment of rats with either DMF (50-500 mg/kg/day, for 3 days) or a single low dose of CCl(4) (0.2mL/kg) alone caused small increases in plasma transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. However, combinatorial treatment of DMF with CCl(4) markedly increased blood biochemical changes. Histopathology confirmed the synergism in hepatotoxicity. Moreover, DMF+CCl(4) caused PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation, but decreased the level of Bcl-xL, all of which confirmed apoptosis of hepatocytes. Consistently, DMF+CCl(4) treatment markedly increased lipid peroxidation. By contrast, treatment of DMF in combination with lipopolysaccharide, acetaminophen or d-galactosamine caused no enhanced hepatotoxicity. Given the link between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction and cell death, ER stress response was monitored after DMF and/or CCl(4) treatment. Whereas either DMF or CCl(4) treatment alone marginally changed the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94 and phosphorylated PKR-like ER-localized eIF2alpha kinase, concomitant treatment with DMF and CCl(4) synergistically induced them with increases in glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein mRNAs. /These/ results demonstrate that DMF treatment in combination with CCl(4) synergistically increases hepatocyte death, which may be associated with the induction of severe ER stress."

Three male and 7 female rats died during the 2-wk exposure to 1,600 ppm DMF, but no death of the exposed rats or mice occurred under any other exposure conditions. Massive, focal and single cell necroses were observed in the liver of DMF-exposed rats and mice. The massive necrosis associated with the centrilobular fibrosis occurred at the highest exposure concentration. The single cell necrosis was associated with fragmentation of the nucleoli as well as an increased mitotic figure. The 13-wk exposures of rats and mice to DMF were characterized by increases in the relative liver weight and the incidence of the centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy as well as increased serum levels of AST, ALT, LDH, total cholesterol and phospholipid. Lower confidence limits of the benchmark dose yielding the response with a 10% extra risk (BMDL10) were determined for the relative liver weight and the incidence of hepatocellular hypertrophy of the 13-wk exposed animals. The BMDL10 resulted in 1 ppm for the increased relative liver weight of male rats and mice and 17 ppm for the hepatocellular hypertrophy of male mice."

Both the combined inhalation and oral exposures and the single-route exposure through inhalation or ingestion induced centrilobular hypertrophy and single-cell necrosis of hepatocytes, increased plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive hepatocytes without glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive liver foci, and increased relative liver weight. Those hepatic parameters of the DMF-induced effects were classified into hypertrophic, necrotic and proliferative responses according to the pathological characteristics of affected liver. While magnitudes of the hypertrophic and necrotic responses were linearly increased with an increase in amounts of DMF uptake in the single-route exposure groups, those dose-response relationships tended to level off in the combined-exposure groups. Saturation of the hypertrophic and necrotic responses at high dose levels might be attributed to suppression of the metabolic conversion of DMF to its toxic metabolites. Percentage of PCNA-stained hepatocytes classified as the proliferative response was increased more steeply in the combined-exposure groups than in the single-route exposure groups. It was suggested that the proliferative response of hepatocytes to the combined exposures would be greater than that which would be expected under an assumption of additivity for the component proliferative responses to the single-route exposures through inhalation and ingestion."

The results showed that the mortality was directly proportional to the DMF concentration and planarian locomotor velocity (pLMV) was significantly reduced by increasing the exposure time and DMF concentration. pLMV of D. japonica was significantly reduced at a lower concentration of 10 ppm after 7 days of continuous exposure to DMF. The recovery of the motility of planarians pretreated with DMF was found to be time- and dose dependent, all planarians had complete recovery in their motility after 48 hr. The appearance of auricles in regenerating animals was easily affected by DMF exposure in comparison with the appearance of eyespot.

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ A suitable method for the cryopreservation of donkey semen would be very valuable for the ex situ management of genetic diversity in this species. This report uses a variety of observation and trials to evaluate the effect of cryoprotectants in per-cycle pregnancy rates (PC) in equids females (jennies (donkey) and mares (horse)). This was explored by (1) comparing the results of insemination of jennies and mares with cooled or frozen donkey semen, (2) examining the possible toxic effect of the cryoprotectant (CPA) glycerol in these two species and (3) studying alternative solutions. Donkey and horse semen was either used immediately, or cooled according to some steps of the pre-freezing procedure or frozen and thawed. The pre-freezing procedure included semen dilution, centrifugation, resuspension in milk or in INRA82+2% egg yolk+various % CPA (expressed as final concentrations in extended semen (v/v)) and then cooling to 4 degrees C. PC was similar in mares and jennies inseminated with donkey semen cooled to 4 degrees C in milk. However, the PC was significantly higher in mares than in jennies when donkey semen was frozen with 2.2% glycerol (36%, n=50 cycles vs. 11%, n=38 cycles; P<0.01). Increasing the concentrations of glycerol (0, 2.2, 3.5, 4.8%) before cooling stallion semen resulted in a progressive decrease in mare PC (87, 53, 53, 13% (n=15 cycles for each concentration); P<0.0001). The addition of 2.2% glycerol before cooling donkey semen decreased the PC measured in jennies to 0. The replacement of glycerol by 2% dimethylformamide increased the fertility obtained in jennies with cooled donkey semen (PC: 67%, n=12 cycles) but did not increase the fertility obtained with frozen-thawed donkey semen (PC: 11%, n=28 cycles with dimethylformamide vs. 0%, n=16 cycles with glycerol). In conclusion, this study clearly shows that the ability of jennies to conceive after AI with donkey frozen semen is lower than that of mares. Glycerol affects the fertility of donkey and stallion spermatozoa as early as during the pre-freezing procedure. In consequence, the glycerol level must be low in frozen equine semen to provide good fertility. The toxic dose of glycerol for donkey spermatozoa seems to be almost half that for stallion spermatozoa. Whether this greater sensitivity of donkey spermatozoa to glycerol is responsible for the low success of semen cryopreservation in jennies is not so obvious because replacement of glycerol by dimethylformamide was not much more effective in terms of fertility."

Animals given large single doses of DMF or exposed to high air levels showed general depression, anesthesia, loss of appetite, loss of body weight, tremors, labored breathing, convulsions, hemorrhage of the nose and mouth, liver injury, and coma immediately preceding death."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ The effects of DMF on the liver were studied after single or repeated inhalation, dermal, or oral treatment of rats, mice, and rabbits ... . Single oral admin of 2250-5000 mg DMF/kg in rats caused clay-colored liver, congestion and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes. Lower doses resulted in deviations in liver function, such as decreased excretion of cholic acid in the bile, bromosulfthalein retention, increased serum activities of GOT, GPT, LAP, OCT, AlcP, ChE, LDH, and gamma-GT, and significant enhancement of cholesterol, triglyceride, and bilirubin contents in the serum and liver homogenates. In rats, following both ip and inhalation exposure, there were no increases in SDH /succinate dehydrogenase/ levels at 420 and 840 mg/cu m but a lower level (210 mg/cu m) raised the serum activity of SDH. Pathomorphological investigation demonstrated lipid degeneration and cloudy swelling of hepatocytes in the central zones of the lobules followed by signs of regeneration."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ A total of 42 ejaculates were used in the experiment; six ejaculates per stallion, obtained from seven Pure Spanish stallions (PRE), were split and frozen in freezing media with different concentrations and combinations of cryoprotectant (CPA): (i) Caceres (skim milk based extender) containing 2.5% glycerol (2.5GL), (ii) Caceres containing 1.5% glycerol and 1.5% dimethylformamide (1.5%GL-1.5%DMFA), (iii) Caceres extender supplemented with 1.5% glycerol and 2.5% dimethylformamide (1.5%GL-2.5%DMFA) and (iv) Caceres extender supplemented with 4% dimethylformamide (4%DMFA). After at least 4 weeks of storage in liquid nitrogen (LN), straws were thawed and semen analyzed by computer-assisted sperm analysis and flow cytometry (membrane lipid architecture (Merocyanine 540), integrity and sublethal damage (YoPro-1) and mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1)). After thawing, better results were observed in samples frozen in 4%DMFA or in combinations of 1.5%GL-2.5%DMFA, in fact total motility increased by 16% in the 4%DMFA group compared to 2.5%GL (p < 0.05). Also, there was an increment in the percentage of progressive motile sperm in the 1.5%GL-2.5%DMFA group (9.8% 2.5GL vs 19% in the 1.5%GL-2.5%DMFA group p < 0.05); also, samples frozen in the 4%DMFA group had more intact (YoPro-1 negative) sperm post-thawing, 29.3% in 2.5%GL vs 36.7% in 4%DMFA group (p < 0.05). Membrane lipid architecture was not affected by any of the cryoprotectants tested, while samples frozen in 4%DFMA had a lower percentage of mitochondria with lower membrane potential. It is concluded that DMFA improves the outcome of cryopreservation of stallion spermatozoa mainly reducing sublethal cryodamage."
