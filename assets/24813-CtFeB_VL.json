The experimental protocol was the same as that described for the experiments with rats. Like the rats, the response of the guinea pigs was consistent with exposure to an irritating chemical (restlessness, lacrimation, pawing at nose and head). The 4-hr LC50 was 52.5 umole/mole of air (numerically equivalent to 52.5 ppm). Deaths occurred within 48 hours after exposure; no further details were provided. Neutralization of the phosphorus oxychloride with ammonia resulted in a lowering of the LC50 to 41.3 umole/mole of air (numerically equivalent to 41.3 ppm). Similar to the results observed for rats, the simultaneous exposure of the guinea pigs to ammonia was thought to decrease the irritation responses to the phosphorus oxychloride exposure but to increase the overall toxicity. The series of exposures and the respective responses used to obtain the median lethal concentration were not provided and, therefore, no other exposure-response data are available."

Rats received various doses of the compounds via stomach intubation or were exposed by inhalation. Rats were observed, weighed, and grossly examined for abnormalities. Mice, rats, and guinea-pigs inhaled various concentrations of the compounds and were observed for sex related susceptibility and adverse symptoms. Threshold concentrations for single exposures were also determined The local effects of PC, PTC, and PPC were tested on shaved skin and conjunctival sac of rabbit eye. The oral median lethal doses for PC, PTC, and PPC for rats were 380, 550, and 660 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical signs included suppression and disruption of motor coordination, drowsiness, adynamia, and occasional secretions from the eyes. Respiration rate was decreased to 50 to 80 per minute. Cyanosis and tremors occurred after 20 to 40 minutes post treatment. Lungs were bright red, liver dark brown and plethoric, and stomach distended and hemorrhagic. The median lethal concentrations for inhaled PC, PTC, and PPC for rats were 0.071, 0.22, and 0.205 mg/L, respectively. Rats displayed restlessness during the first 5 to 15 minutes, then showed depressed motor coordination, fibrillary jerking and twitching, tremor, retarded respiration, and labored breathing. Rats and guinea-pigs also showed lacrymation and clouding of cornea. Weight loss and appetite loss were observed several days post exposure. Exposure to PTC induced skin and mouth ulcers. All three species and males and females were similarly sensitive to the compounds via inhalation. PC and PTC caused thickening of skin folds and bleeding in rabbits and irreversible necrosis in the eye causing loss of vision. The threshold concentrations for a single exposure to PC, PTC, and PPC were 0.001, 0.005, and 0.008 mg/L, respectively, and according to acute action, 0.006, 0.01, and 0.4 mg/L, respectively."

            "Value": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Phosphorus oxychloride (POCl(3)) is an intermediate in the synthesis of many organophosphorus insecticides and chemical warfare nerve gases that are toxic to insects and mammals by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. It was therefore surprising to observe that POCl(3), which is hydrolytically unstable, also itself gives poisoning signs in ip-treated mice and fumigant-exposed houseflies similar to those produced by the organophosphorus ester insecticides and chemical warfare agents. In mice, POCl(3) inhibits serum butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) at a sublethal dose and muscle but not brain AChE at a lethal dose. In houseflies, POCl(3)-induced brain AChE inhibition is correlated with poisoning and the probable cause thereof. POCl(3) in vitro is selective for AChE (IC(50) = 12-36 microM) compared with several other serine hydrolases (BuChE, carboxylesterase, elastase, alpha-chymotrypsin, and thrombin) (IC(50) = 88-2000 microM). With electric eel AChE, methylcarbamoylation of the active site with eserine reversibly protects against subsequent irreversible inhibition by POCl(3). Most importantly, POCl(3)-induced electric eel AChE inhibition prevents postlabeling with [(3)H]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate; i.e., both compounds phosphorylate at Ser-200 in the catalytic triad. Pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide does not reactivate POCl(3)-inhibited AChE, consistent with an anionic phosphoserine residue at the esteratic site. The actual phosphorylating agent is formed within seconds from POCl(3) in water, has a half-life of approximately 2 min, and is identified as phosphorodichloridic acid [HOP(O)Cl(2)] by (31)P NMR and derivatization with dimethylamine to HOP(O)(NMe(2))(2). POCl(3) on reaction with water and HOP(O)Cl(2) have the same potency for inhibition of AChE from either electric eel or housefly head as well as the same toxicity for mice. In summary, the acute toxicity of POCl(3) is attributable to hydrolytic activation to HOP(O)Cl(2) that phosphorylates AChE at the active site to form enzymatically inactive [O-phosphoserine]AChE."

Treatment with 0.48 mg/cu m caused weight loss, changes of respiration frequency and oxygen consumption, respiratory irritation, and increased relative kidney weight. These effects had subsided after 1 month of recovery. In animals of the high dose group (1.34 mg/cu m) the effects noted in the low dose group were significantly increased. Additionally, there was severe irritation of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and a chronic rhinitis, tracheitis, desquamating bronchial catarrh, hyperplasia of mucus cells and round cell infiltration of the submucosa. In liver and kidney protein dystrophy and small droplet fatty degeneration and altered urinary concentrations of hippuric acid and protein were noted. The excretion of phosphorus, chloride and calcium were altered. Bones showed degradation and reduction of the number of trabeculae and in cells of the bone marrow chromosomal anomalies were increased (5 of 9 animals affected; no quantitative data no experimental detail; no such effects at 0.48 mg/cu m; effects only in combination with overt toxicity. The excess phosphate produced by hydrolysis of phosphoryl trichloride may play a role in the development of these effects on kidney bone and calcium levels)."
