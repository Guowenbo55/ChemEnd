Florpyrauxifen-benzyl is a new synthetic auxindeveloped for use asanaquatic herbicide. A study was conducted at North Carolina State University in which 10 \u03bcgL\u22121 of 25% radiolabeled florpyrauxifen-benzyl was applied to the isolated shoot tissue of 10 different aquatic plant species to elucidate absorption and translocation patterns in these species. Extremely high levels of shoot absorption were observed for all species, and uptake was rapid. Highest shoot absorptions were observed for crested floatingheart [Nymphoides cristata (Roxb.) Kuntze] (A192 = 20 \u03bcgg\u22121), dioecious hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle] (A192 = 25.3 \u03bcgg\u22121), variable watermilfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum Michx.) (A192=40.1 \u03bcg g\u22121), and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) (A192=25.3 \u03bcgg\u22121). Evidence of translocation was observed in all rooted species tested, with the greatest translocation observed in N. cristata (1.28 \u03bcgg\u22121 at 192 hafter treatment). The results of this study add to the growing body of knowledge surrounding the behavior of this newly registered herbicide within aquatic plants.",

Research studies were conducted to investigate the effects of soil moisture on the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of florpyrauxifen-benzyl in three troublesome weeds. In the absorption/translocation study, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), hemp sesbania (Sesbania herbacea), and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus) were treated with [14C]florpyrauxifen-benzyl under two soil moisture conditions: 7.5% and 60% field capacity. The results showed that greater absorption occurred under moist soil conditions (60% soil moisture content). Additionally, more translocation of the herbicide to the area above the treated leaf was observed under moist soil conditions compared to dry soil conditions across all weed species. Sesbania herbacea exhibited the highest translocation, with 25% of the absorbed herbicide moving above the treated leaf, which was greater than the other two weed species under 60% soil moisture. However, there were no significant differences in translocation among the weed species under the 7.5% soil moisture regime. In the metabolism study, it was found that under high soil moisture conditions, S. herbacea, which is highly sensitive to even low doses of florpyrauxifen-benzyl, had 95% of the recovered herbicide in its acid form. Soil moisture also influenced the amount of acid form found in all weed species. Although these findings provide only a limited understanding of the physiological processes involved, they suggest that in the field, soil moisture content will likely play a significant role in the absorption, translocation, and metabolism of florpyrauxifen-benzyl in E. crus-galli, S. herbacea, and C. esculentus.",
