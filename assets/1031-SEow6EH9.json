It has a role as a protic solvent and a metabolite. It is a short-chain primary fatty alcohol and a member of propan-1-ols.",

Typical n-propanol removal efficiencies for an anaerobic lagoon treatment facility with a retention time of 15 days were 77% and 81% after loading with concentrated wastes(1). In closed bottle studies, n-propanol was completely degraded anaerobically by an acetate-enriched culture, derived from a seed of domestic sludge(1). The culture started to utilize cross-fed n-propanol after 4 days, at a rate of 110 mg/l per day(1). In a mixed reactor with a 20-day retention time, seeded by the same culture, 41% removal was achieved in the 20 days following 70 days of acclimation to give a final n-propanol of 10,000 mg/l(1)."
