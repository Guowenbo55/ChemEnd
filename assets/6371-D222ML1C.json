            "Value": "Phosgene is a highly reactive gas capable of damaging a variety of biological macromolecules in an oxidant-like fashion. This activity potentially results from at least two separate chemical reactions: acylation and hydrolysis. Acylation, the more important and rapid mechanism, results from the reaction of phosgene with nucleophilic moieties, such as the amino, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl groups of tissue macromolecules. Acylation causes destruction of proteins and lipids, irreversible alterations of membrane structures, and disruption of enzyme and other cell functions. Exposure to phosgene depletes lung nucleophiles, particularly glutathione, and restoration of glutathione seems to protect against phosgene-induced injury. For several days after acute phosgene exposure, tissue levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, increase as part of the lungs' response to injury. In addition to acylation, phosgene is hydrolyzed to HCl ... The formation of HCl occurs on moist membranes and may cause irritation and tissue damage. Because of the limited water solubility of phosgene, it is unlikely that large quantities of HCl could result from the exposure of biological tissues. However, small amounts do form and may contact moist membranes of the eye, nasopharynx, and respiratory tract. Hydrolysis to HCl is the probable cause of immediate inflammation and discomfort after phosgene exposure at concentrations greater than 3 ppm (>12 mg/cu m). Pulmonary cellular glycolysis and oxygen uptake following phosgene exposure are depressed and, thus, leads to a corresponding decrease in the levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This is associated with increased water uptake by epithelial, interstitial, and endothelial cells. The semipermeability of the blood-air barrier becomes gradually compromised as a result of fluid entering the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Later, the blood-air barrier disrupts, opening channels for the flooding of alveoli. Compression of pulmonary microvasculature leads to the opening of arteriovenous shunt. The onset of pulmonary edema correlates temporally with the decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels. Interventions that increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, such as treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., aminophylline), beta-adrenergic agonists (e.g., isoproterenol), or cyclic adenosine monophosphate analogs, markedly reduce pulmonary edema formation in animals exposed to phosgene."

            "Value": "The pathology of phosgene poisoning is mainly due to its acylating properties and not a result of hydrochloric acid generation upon hydrolysis, although hydrochloric acid production may play a minor role. The production of pulmonary edema following phosgene exposure has been correlated with reductions in pulmonary ATP levels and sodium-potassium ATPase activity, as well as inhibition of other pulmonary enzymes. The role of the nervous system in the toxicity of phosgene is considered to be a nonspecific effect of irritant gases."

            "Value": "Phosgene is only slightly soluble in water; the small amount of phosgene which dissolves is immediately hydrolyzed to CO2 and HCl. The concentration of HCl produced from a lethal dose of phosgene is </= 10R-10 M, which can be easily buffered by the lung tissue.  The inhalation toxicity of phosgene is enhanced by its low water solubility, which allows it to penetrate further into the lungs than can more soluble gases. When phosgene reaches the alveolar region it reacts with NH2-, SH- or OH-groups of the bloood-air barrier. The acylating reaction of phosgene occurs much more rapidly than the reaction of phosgene with water."

The first ultrastructural alteration was vesiculation of cells in the terminal bronchiolar epithelium and most probably represented the beginning of edema in these cells. This was followed by septal extracellular edema with minimal intracellular edema. Intracellular edema developed next and led to cellular disruption and necrosis. As the postexposure period continued, some type II cells developed cellular edema, and on a focal basis type I cells were disrupted. Fluid appeared in the alveoli after the intracellular and extracellular interstitial spaces of the septa became very swollen. Despite this widespread interstital edema, large areas of the cells comprising major portions of the air-blood barrier were tenaciously adherent to areas of the fused basement membrane. Interstitial cells seem to be very susceptible to the effects of edema, but it is not possible based on this study to determine whether these cells are specific targets of phosgene chemical reaction. Metabolic depression and disturbance, as judged by decreases in enzymatic activity, may precede major ultrastructural changes in the alveolar region."

Increased lung weights and elevations in protein, soluble collagen, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts in BAL were observed at 1050 mg/cu m x min with borderline changes at 495 mg/cu m x min. Following exposure to 1050 mg/cu m x min, the analysis of arterial blood gases provided evidence of a significantly decreased arterial pO2. Histopathology revealed a mild, although distinctive, inflammatory response at the bronchoalveolar level at 495 mg/cu m x min, whereas serofibrinous exudates and edema were observed at 1050 mg/cu m x min. The magnitude of effects correlated with the individual dogs' respiratory minute volume and breathing patterns (panting). Collectively, phosgene-induced indicators of acute lung injury appeared to be characterized best by protein in BAL fluid. With regard to both the inhaled dose and the associated increase of protein in BAL, the responses obtained in dogs appear to be more similar to humans. In contrast, elevations in BAL protein occurred in rats at three-fold lower concentrations when compared to dogs. The results of this study demonstrate that the magnitude of elevations of plasma exudate in BAL fluid following acute exposure to the pulmonary irritant phosgene is markedly more pronounced in rats when compared to the dog which is considered more human-like than rats. This is believed to be associated with the higher ventilation of small rodents and with rodent-specific sensory bronchopulmonary defense reflexes."

A similar group of mice was exposed to room air for 25 min. After exposure, conscious mice were placed unrestrained in a whole-body plethysmograph to determine breathing frequency (f), inspiration (Ti) and expiration (Te) times, tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV), end inspiratory pause (EIP), end expiratory (EEP) pause, peak inspiratory flows (PIF), peak expiratory flows (PEF), and a measure of bronchoconstriction (Penh). All parameters were evaluated every 15 min for 12 hr. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration and lung wet/dry weight ratios (W/D) were also determined at 1, 4, 8, and 12 hr. A treatment x time repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences between air and phosgene for EEP, EIP, PEF, PIF, TV, and MV, p < or =.05, across 12 hr. Phosgene-exposed mice had a significantly longer mean Ti, p < or =.05, compared with air-exposed mice over time. Mice exposed to phosgene showed marked increases (approximately double) in Penh across all time points, beginning at 5 h, when compared with air-exposed mice, p </ =.05. BALF protein, an indicator of air/blood barrier integrity, and W/D were significantly higher, 10- to 12-fold, in phosgene-exposed than in air-exposed mice 4-12 hr after exposure, p </=.001 and p </ =.05, respectively. These results indicate that exposure to phosgene causes early bronchoconstriction, a temporal obstructivelike injury pattern, and disruption of mechanical rhythm largely regulated by the progressive production of pulmonary edema on airway flow. Potential therapeutic intervention may include compounds that produce bronchodilation and mechanical ventilation support if warranted."

WHen the rats were infected with influenza virus 24 hr postexposure, a prolonged and significantly enhanced pulmonary influenza virus infection was detected through day 4 post infection in phosgene exposed rats. Furthermore, a significant suppression in the specific antiviral immune response of the pulmonary cytotoxic T-lymphocytes was detected 10 days post infection. THe natural killer (NK) activity in whole-lung homogenate was suppressed on day 1,2, and 4 after exposure, however normal levels were observed 7 days postexposure. Splenic NK activity was also significantly decreased on day 1 post exposure. ..."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ ... Aspects of the development of tolerance to phosgene in several species /were reviewed/. For example, guinea pigs treated with low doses of phosgene - 1.5 ppm (6 mg/cu m) for 10 min - for 7 d became relatively resistant to toxic concentrations - 35 ppm for 10 min. Repeated exposure of cats to phosgene at 1.5 to 3.8 ppm or 5 to 6 ppm for 10 min every day had caused no greater lung damage after 40 d than after 2 d. These animals were able to tolerate a total Ct of 9,000 mg x min/cu m (total time, 400 min), even though the LCt50 for cats is about 2,000 mg min/cu m for 1 min. Tolerance to high doses of phosgene is believed by some to represent a manifestation of pathologic changes in the lungs."

This study aims to examine the pathophysiological changes seen with low tidal volume ventilation (protective ventilation (PV)) strategies compared to conventional ventilation (CV), in a model of phosgene-induced acute lung injury. Anesthetized pigs were instrumented and exposed to phosgene (concentration x time (Ct), 2,350 mg x min x cu m) and then ventilated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (tidal volume (TV) = 10 mL/kg; positive end expiratory pressure, 3 cm H2O; frequency, 20 breaths/min; fractional concentration of inspired oxygen, 0.24), monitored for 6 hours after exposure, and then randomized into treatment groups: CV, PV (A) or (B) (TV, 8 or 6 mL/kg; positive end expiratory pressure, 8 cm H2O; frequency, 20 or 25 breaths/min; fractional concentration of inspired oxygen, 0.4). Pathophysiological parameters were measured for up to 24 hours. The results show that PV resulted in improved oxygenation, decreased shunt fraction, and mortality, with all animals surviving to 24 hours compared to only three of the CV animals. Microscopy confirmed reduced hemorrhage, neutrophilic infiltration, and intra-alveolar edema."
