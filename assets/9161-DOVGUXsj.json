Acenaphthylene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(2). Flask studies using groundwater from a creosote site and some surface soil found that an initial concentration of 0.6 ug/mL acenaphthylene was reduced to 0.2 ug/mL after 14 days of incubation while in sterile controls, reduction reached 0.4 ug/mL(3). Using a static-culture flask-screening procedure and a settled domestic wastewater inoculum, acenaphthylene (at 5 and 10 mg/L) showed major degradation and adaptation with 91-100% biodegradability after 7 days and three subsequent 7-day subcultures(4)."

In 203 days, 958 mg/kg of acenaphthylene in a wood preserving sludge degraded to 35 mg/kg in a Derby soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions(2). At 83 days the concentration of acenaphthylene was 2003 mg/kg and at 287 days the concentration was 50 mg/kg in a Masham soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions inoculated with wood preserving sludge(2). The succeeding first order rate constants are 0.0116, 0.0152, 0.0562 and 0.163 day-1, with a second order rate constant of 0.0181 day-1; which correspond to half-lives of 60, 45.6, 12.3, 42.5 and 121.3 days for acenaphthylene(2). Acenaphthylene at a concentration of 1 mg/g disappeared from a Nixon sandy loam soil within 4 months(3); however, acenaphthylene loss from poisoned controls after 16 months of incubation in the dark at 20 \u00b0C suggested volatilization could more important than biodegradation(3). Flooded soil tests conducted in erlenmeyer flasks under aerobic conditions determined acenaphthylene biodegradation and volatilization rates of 0.53 and 1.60 ppm/day respectively using an initial concentration of 100 ppm dry soil(4)."
