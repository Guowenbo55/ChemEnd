    "Description": "Benzoyl chloride is an acyl chloride consisting of benzene in which a hydrogen is replaced by an acyl chloride group. It is an important chemical intermediate for the manufacture of other chemicals, dyes, perfumes, herbicides and pharmaceuticals. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent. It is an acyl chloride and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a benzoic acid.",

After rather high dose exposure, BTC exhibited leukemogenic and pulmonary tumorigenic activities as well as potent dermal carcinogenic activity. After administration of the chemicals at the dose of 2.3 uL/animal, twice a week for 50 weeks, BTC induced 68% incidence of skin cancers and 58% incidence of pulmonary tumors (including 10% of lung carcinomas) within 399 days. Incidence of skin cancers was 58% for BAC, 15% for BYC and 10% for BOC within 560 days. Considering the extent of possible exposure of the workers to these chemicals in the working environment and the carcinogenic potency of the chemicals tested, it can be concluded that BTC was very probably responsible for causing the cancers seen in the workers employed in manufacturing BOC."
