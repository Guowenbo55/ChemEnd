The rate of biodegradation of dicamba in soil generally increases with temperature and soil moisture (up to 50%) and tends to be faster when the soil is slightly acidic(2). Incubation of dicamba in soil under aerobic conditions resulted in 50% degradation in 20 days(3).

Rats (10/sex) in the control and 12,000 ppm groups were maintained for a 4 week recovery period to determine the reversibility of effects. No treatment-related deaths were observed in any treatment group. The liver was the target organ, as evidenced by microscopic liver changes associated with clinical serum chemistry changes and increased relative (to body) liver weights (increased 20-23%) in both sexes at the high dose. The livers of the 12,000 ppm females exhibited slight centrolobular hepatocyte hypertrophy (4/10) and an increased incidence of minimal to moderate hepatocellular pigmentation (5/10). Both sexes exhibited increased alkaline phosphatase (increased 62-76%), serum alanine aminotransferase (increased 59-66%), and serum aspartate aminotransferase (increased 29%) activities compared to the controls. Females exhibited an increase in mean gamma glutamyl transferase activity (increased 136%) while males showed a decrease activity (decreased 50%) compared to the controls. Other effects observed in the 12,000 ppm rats were transient hypothermia (weeks 1-4), reduced activity, slower movements, decreased food consumption, and less efficient food utilization than the controls throughout the treatment period. Lower mean final body weights (decreased 18-20%), body weight gains (decreased 28-40%) and adipose tissue content were observed compared to the controls. Decreases in protein (decreased 10-15%) and globulin (decreased 16-26%) levels were observed in both sexes. In females, decreased mean hemoglobin concentration (decreased 4%) and red blood cell counts (decreased 4%), and decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (decreased 3%) were observed. Significant (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) increases of white blood cell count (increased 13%) and lymphocyte count (increased 33%) were observed in 12000 ppm females compared to the controls. Males had a lower mean platelet count (decreased 7%) and shorter partial thromboplastin time (decreased 11%) compared to the controls. Urinalysis showed that males excreted more triple phosphate crystals in the 12000 ppm group, whereas females excreted more uric acid crystals in the 12000 and 6000 ppm groups at week 12. Following a 4 week recovery period, all observed effects were recovered. The LOAEL for this study is 12,000 ppm (1000 mg/kg/day), based on clinical signs, reduced body weight gains, hematological and clinical serum chemistry changes in both sexes, centrolobular hepatocyte hypertrophy and hepatocellular pigmentation in females, and increased relative (to body) liver weights for both sexes.

The ability of xenobiotics to effect these hepatic changes often portends their positive outcomes in chronic bioassays. Dicamba's ability to induce hepatomegaly and peroxisome proliferation was studied in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were placed on feed containing 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1% dicamba or 0.01% ciprofibrate for 3 weeks. Dicamba had no effect on relative liver weights or feed efficiency in either female or male rats at all doses tested. Dicamba, however, caused a statistically significant increase in peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity in liver homogenates from rats of both sexes fed 1% dicamba. Fatty acyl CoA-oxidase activity was increased in male rats fed 1% dicamba. A protein of M(r) 80 kDa was visible when liver homogenates of female or male rats fed 1% dicamba were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Lauric acid hydroxylase activity and CYP4A-reactive protein were increased in microsomes from male rats fed the highest level of dicamba. Moreover, dicamba was observed to transcriptionally upregulate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), a peroxisome proliferator sensitive receptor previously shown to be linked to the transcriptional regulation of a variety of peroxisome-specific enzymes. These studies show that dicamba is a peroxisome proliferator in rats. Although dicamba was not an efficacious inducer of peroxisomal enzymes in these rats, dicamba's ability to transcriptionally activate the PPAR and induce peroxisomal and related enzymes must be considered in the safety evaluation of this herbicide."

In recent years there has been much attention to the biotic degradation of pesticides. Abiotic mechanisms in the soil can contribute to pesticide degradation yet the toxicological impact of such degradation is unclear. This study combines ... an investigation into abiotic mechanisms of degradation coupled with toxicological endpoints in mammalian cells. The genotoxicity of three commonly used agricultural pesticides was assessed before and after exposure to redox-modified clay minerals. The objectives of the study were to determine the genotoxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, and oxamyl, using single cell gel electrophoresis with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and to determine the effect of the iron oxidation state in clay minerals (ferruginous smectite SWa-1) on the genotoxic potency of the pesticides. 2,4-D alone or following reaction with redox-modified clays did not induce DNA damage in CHO cells. Oxamyl alone induced a concentration-dependent increase in genomic DNA damage; however, its genotoxicity declined after reaction with reduced clay minerals. Dicamba was not genotoxic when directly analyzed. When dicamba was reacted with reduced clay, a concentration-dependent increase in genomic DNA damage was observed. ..."

Log-phase cells were treated with 1-500 ug/mL of the herbicides and harvested 24 hr later for SCE and cell-cycle progression analyses. All concentrations assessed of both test compounds induced higher SCE frequencies over control values. SCEs increased in a non-dose-dependent manner neither for the pure compound (r=0.48; P>0.05) nor for the commercial formulation (r=0.58, P>0.05). For the 200 ug/mL and 500 ug/mL dicamba doses and the 500 ug/mL banvel dose, a significant delay in the cell-cycle progression was found. A regression test showed that the proliferation rate index decreased as a function of either the concentration of dicamba (r=-0.98, P<0.05) or banvel (r=-0.88, P<0.01) titrated into cultures in the 1-500 ug/mL dose-range. SCGE performed on CHO cells after a 90 min pulse-treatment of dicamba and banvel within a 50-500 ug/mL dose-range revealed a clear increase in dicamba-induced DNA damage as an enhancement of the proportion of slightly damaged and damaged cells for all concentrations used (P<0.01); concomitantly, a decrease of undamaged cells was found over control values (P<0.01). In banvel-treated cells, a similar overall result was registered. Dicamba induced a significant increase both in comet length and width over control values (P<0.01) regardless of its concentration whereas banvel induced the same effect only within 100-500 ug/mL dose range (P<0.01). As detected by three highly sensitive bioassays, the present results clearly showed the capability of dicamba and banvel to induce DNA and cellular damage on CHO cells."

The activities of both compounds were tested within the range of 50-500 ug/mL on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Overall, dicamba and Banvel produced a NDI dose-dependent decrease but the response was statistically significant only in cultures treated with Banvel at a 100-500 ug/mL concentration range. A dose-dependent induction of MN was observed after dicamba- and Banvel-treatments within the 50-400 ug/mL and 50-500 ug/mL concentration-ranges, respectively. Induction of NPBs and NBUDs was significantly enhanced by both test compounds. The NPBs/MN ratio values found for dicamba and Banvel were 0.04-0.11 and 0.05-0.18, respectively. Results clearly demonstrated that dicamba and Banvel exerted both cyto- and genotoxic damage on CHO-K1 cells.

State 3 and respiration uncoupled by FCCP (carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) were inhibited to approximately the same extent, i.e. by about 70%. Depression of respiratory activity is essentially mediated through partial inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II and III. ATPase activity was much less depressed by dicamba than ATP synthase activity. Therefore, a considerable part of the inhibition observed on ATP synthase is the result of an inhibition on the redox complexes. The loss of phosphorylation capacity, induced by dicamba, was in the last analysis not only the result of a direct effect of dicamba on the enzymatic complex (F(0)-F(1) ATPase) but also the result of a deleterious effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane, which can promote an inhibition of the respiratory complexes and an increase of the proton permeability of the inner membrane."

This work was performed to further characterize lawn chemical exposures in dogs, and to determine environmental factors associated with chemical residence time on grass. In addition to concern for canine health, a strong justification for the work was that dogs may serve as sentinels for potentially harmful environmental exposures in humans. Experimentally, herbicides [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxypropionic acid (MCPP), dicamba] were applied to grass plots under different conditions (e.g., green, dry brown, wet, and recently mowed grass). Chemicals in dislodgeable residues were measured by LC-MS at 0.17, 1, 24, 48, 72 hr post treatment. In a separate study, 2,4-D, MCPP, and dithiopyr concentrations were measured in the urine of dogs and in dislodgeable grass residues in households that applied or did not apply chemicals in the preceding 48 hr. Chemicals were measured at 0, 24, and 48 hr post application in treated households and at time 0 in untreated control households. Residence times of 2,4-D, MCPP, and dicamba were significantly prolonged (P<0.05) on dry brown grass compared to green grass. Chemicals were detected in the urine of dogs in 14 of 25 households before lawn treatment, in 19 of 25 households after lawn treatment, and in 4 of 8 untreated households. Chemicals were commonly detected in grass residues from treated lawns, and from untreated lawns suggesting chemical drift from nearby treated areas. Thus dogs could be exposed to chemicals through contact with their own lawn (treated or contaminated through drift) or through contact with other grassy areas if they travel. The length of time to restrict a dog's access to treated lawns following treatment remains to be defined. Further study is indicated to assess the risks of herbicide exposure in humans and dogs."

            "Value": "/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Biocides, such as herbicides, are routinely tested for toxicity but not for sublethal effects on microbes. Many biocides are known to induce an adaptive multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype. This can be due to either an increase in the expression of efflux pumps, a reduced synthesis of outer membrane porins, or both. Exposures of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to commercial formulations of three herbicides-dicamba (Kamba), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and glyphosate (Roundup)-were found to induce a changed response to antibiotics. Killing curves in the presence and absence of sublethal herbicide concentrations showed that the directions and the magnitudes of responses varied by herbicide, antibiotic, and species. When induced, MICs of antibiotics of five different classes changed up to 6-fold. In some cases the MIC increased, and in others it decreased. Herbicide concentrations needed to invoke the maximal response were above current food maximum residue levels but within application levels for all herbicides. Compounds that could cause induction had additive effects in combination. The role of soxS, an inducer of the AcrAB efflux pump, was tested in beta-galactosidase assays with soxS-lacZ fusion strains of E. coli. Dicamba was a moderate inducer of the sox regulon. Growth assays with Phe-Arg beta-naphtylamide (PAbetaN), an efflux pump inhibitor, confirmed a significant role of efflux in the increased tolerance of E. coli to chloramphenicol in the presence of dicamba and to kanamycin in the presence of glyphosate. Pathways of exposure with relevance to the health of humans, domestic animals, and critical insects are discussed. Increasingly common chemicals used in agriculture, domestic gardens, and public places can induce a multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype in potential pathogens. The effect occurs upon simultaneous exposure to antibiotics and is faster than the lethal effect of antibiotics. The magnitude of the induced response may undermine antibiotic therapy and substantially increase the probability of spontaneous mutation to higher levels of resistance. The combination of high use of both herbicides and antibiotics in proximity to farm animals and important insects, such as honeybees, might also compromise their therapeutic effects and drive greater use of antibiotics. To address the crisis of antibiotic resistance requires broadening our view of environmental contributors to the evolution of resistance."

            "content": "In the context of BAS 662H, dicamba plays a crucial role as an auxin herbicide, complemented by diflufenzopyr's action as an auxin transport inhibitor. Dicamba, when applied alone or in combination with diflufenzopyr, has shown notable effects on various plant species. In weed species like Amaranthus retroflexus and Galium aparine, dicamba's action was significantly enhanced by diflufenzopyr. The combined treatment led to increased ACC synthase activity, ethylene formation, and accumulation of (\u00fe)-abscisic acid (ABA) within 20 hours. This accumulation correlated with growth inhibition, hydrogen peroxide overproduction, and tissue damage, indicating a synergistic herbicidal effect. However, in corn plants, dicamba's behavior was influenced by diflufenzopyr. Diflufenzopyr considerably decreased the foliar uptake of dicamba by about 50% selectively in corn, compared to when dicamba was applied alone. Additionally, dicamba's systemic translocation and concentration beyond treated plant parts were notably lower in corn compared to weed species. Moreover, dicamba metabolism was not significantly influenced by the presence of diflufenzopyr, but its overall effect and translocation within the corn plant were hindered. This prevented the synergistic enhancement of dicamba's herbicidal activity observed in weed species. The selective action and improved tolerance of corn to dicamba in the presence of diflufenzopyr highlight the complex interplay between these compounds. While dicamba retains its herbicidal properties, its efficacy and translocation dynamics are notably altered in the presence of diflufenzopyr, contributing to the selectivity of BAS 662H in weed control while preserving corn health.",
