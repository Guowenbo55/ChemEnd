            "Value": "Resting cells of Pseudomonas oleovorans PO-1R that had been grown on octane were able to oxidize 1-nonene to produce 1,2-epoxynonane(1). The appearance of the epoxide occurred after only a half hour exposure to 1-nonene(1). In a similar study, Corynebacterium sp (7E1C) bacteria was able to degrade 1-nonene at an optimal temperature of 30 \u00b0C and a pH range of 7.0-7.6(2). This study revealed that terminating alkenes were more recalcitrant compared to those alkenes with the double bond located elsewhere on the molecule. Researchers also noted that as the chain length of the alkene increased, so did the susceptibility to microbial attack(2). Alkenes can be utilized by a wide range of microorganisms and are catabolized via several routes(3). These include the oxidation of a terminal methyl group leaving the double bond intact and resulting in unsaturated alcohol, aldehyde and fatty acid or oxidation of the double bond resulting in the formation of epoxide, diol compounds and possibly hydroxyacids(3). 1-Nonene's linear hydrocarbon structure would suggest that biodegradation is an important process in soil and water(4)."
