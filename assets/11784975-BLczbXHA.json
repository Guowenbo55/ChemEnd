Previous studies have established the selectivity and concentration exposure time requirements for aquatic herbicides used to control hydrilla and EWM; therefore, the objective of this research was to conduct a comparative study evaluating fluridone, triclopyr, and penoxsulam absorption and translocation in these two aquatic plants. Using 14C-labeled herbicides, absorption and translocation were measured over a 192-h time course. On the basis of differences in lipophilicity among the three herbicides (fluridone, penoxsulam, triclopyr), it was expected that fluridone would have the highest accumulation, with significantly lower accumulation for penoxsulam and triclopyr. However, experimental results did not support this hypothesis. Triclopyr accumulation was highest in EWM and was equivalent to fluridone in hydrilla. Penoxsulam absorption and translocation were low in both species. Additionally, accumulation after shoot exposure was approximately three times greater for EWM compared with hydrilla. Shoot-to-root translocation was limited, with a maximum of 12.5% of absorbed triclopyr reaching hydrilla roots 192 h after treatment.",

Biomass reduction of alligatorweed at 42 d after treatment (DAT) compared to nontreated was greatest at 21/11 C (day/night) compared to 26/18 C or 30/25 C for all treatments. Propanil plus penoxsulam reduced biomass less than penoxsulam applied alone, independent of temperature. At 21 and 27 C, delaying propanil application 3 d after penoxsulam provided similar biomass reduction to penoxsulam applied alone. At 27 C and 30 C, delaying propanil application 10 d after treatment was required to achieve biomass reduction greater or equal to penoxsulam applied alone. Absorption and translocation of 14C penoxsulam indicated that propanil reduced absorption of penoxsulam into the treated leaf of alligatorweed 48 h after treatment. This research demonstrates the potential for propanil to antagonize penoxsulam when applied to alligatorweed. Under the most severe antagonistic conditions (30 C) propanil applications following penoxsulam needed to be delayed 10 d to avoid antagonism.",
