            "content": "The study investigated the response of common lambsquarters to halosulfuron-methyl and 2,4-D applications, assessing their effects on absorption, translocation, and metabolism of halosulfuron. Halosulfuron alone did not effectively control the weed, whereas 2,4-D showed a decline in fresh weights with increasing rates. When combined, these herbicides exhibited a synergistic effect, resulting in lower fresh weights compared to individual applications. Laboratory findings suggested that the absorption and translocation of halosulfuron were not impacted by the addition of 2,4-D. Results revealed that 14C-halosulfuron absorption increased over time, while translocation out of the treated leaf remained minimal (less than 6%). Only a small percentage of halosulfuron was detected in the foliage above the treated leaf, and even less below or in the roots. The limited translocation observed was attributed to halosulfuron's physiochemical properties as a weak acid, likely involving phloem-mediated movement and constrained by its mode of action. ",
