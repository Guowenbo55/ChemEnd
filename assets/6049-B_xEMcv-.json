An enriched culture of microorganisms has been found to be an effective method for the degradation of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid(3). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(4)."

Repeated exposure for 15 minutes of de-epithelialized eyes caused marked swelling of the corneal stroma, intense conjunctival chemosis with small conjunctival hemorrhages, and hemorrhagic iritis. No damage occurred when a 0.1 M solution was dropped once on the normal human cornea. A 0.1-M solution dropped continuously for 15 minutes on rabbit cornea with the corneal epithelium removed caused a little more corneal edema, chemosis, and hyperemia of the iris than did the removal of the epithelium itself. Healing was complete in 3 days, which was comparable to de-epithelialized controls. The exposed corneas were as clear as the control corneas. A 0.01-M solution of EDTA dropped on the human cornea produced almost no discomfort. Repeated droppings for up to 15 minutes caused no damage, only mild, pale edema of the conjunctiva. The same concentration dropped on de-epithelialized rabbit corneas caused mild, pale conjunctival edema and mild edema of the corneal stroma. The eyes returned to normal in 2 to 4 days. A 0.01-M solution injected intracorneally produced a pronounced, bluish swelling of the cornea at the injection site that disappeared in 2 weeks. A 0.01-M solution of EDTA injected into the anterior chamber caused a diffuse corneal edema and marked hyperemia of the iris and conjunctiva. These observations led the investigators to conclude that a 0.01-M neutral solution of EDTA was safe and nonirritating for dropping on the denuded human cornea for 15 minutes, but not for injection into the globe."

After dosing with 2.0X 10-3 M, significant amounts of EDTA were found in the cornea and conjunctiva; EDTA was also detected in the iris/ciliary body of rabbits killed 20 minutes after treatment.

Reduced concentrations of glycerol were observed in the iris and conjunctiva if concentrations of 0.5% to 2% Cromolyn was used as the chelating agent rather than EDTA, but no increases of glycerol was observed in the aqueous humor or cornea. Instillation of calcium after dosing with EDTA reduced concentrations of glycerol in aqueous humor to near that obtained when glycerol alone was instilled, and the glycerol concentration was not decreased in the iris/ciliary body.

The effect of EDTA plus x-ray irradiation on Drosophila was slightly less than the sum of the agents' individual effects and that EDTA did not induce sex-linked recessive lethals. ... The crossover frequency did not differ for radiosensitive D. melanogaster larvae exposed to EDTA, compared to controls. Only radioresistant larvae had a significantly increased recombination frequency compared to controls with a comparatively small percentage of spontaneous crossing over. The fertility index in radiosensitive larvae was, however, reduced compared to radioresistant larvae. Treatment with both EDTA and the mutagens 1-methyl-2-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidmne and triethylenemelammne did not increase the frequency of aberrations. It was concluded that EDTA was not an efficient modifying agent with respect to point mutations induced by irradiation or chemical mutagens."

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. The pKa of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is 0.26(3), indicating that this compound will almost entirely exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid adsorption onto lake sediment was 9, 8.6, 24.8, 21.3, 15.4 and 6.3% when complexed with sodium, copper, iron III, mercury, manganese and nickle, respectively(5). The fraction of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid absorbed onto sediment in samples of surface waters, ground waters, and waste water treatment plant effluents from Switzerland was an average of one percent(6)."
