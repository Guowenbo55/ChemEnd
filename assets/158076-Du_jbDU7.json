Paclobutrazol was not translocated out of leaf laminae, shoot tips, or from one-year-old wood, but translocation occurred out of a treated petiole into the attached leaf. No basipetal translocation was detected, suggesting movement through the xylem. Localized application of paclobutrazol caused a reduction in shoot extension and leaf production when the young stem or shoot tip were treated, with decreasing effects as older parts of the stem were treated. Treatment of laminae or petioles had only a slight effect on shoot extension, while treatment of one-year-old wood was ineffective. Combined treatment of the shoot tip plus young stem had a similar effect to treatment of the complete shoot. These findings suggest that paclobutrazol exerts its effects on shoot growth by inhibiting gibberellin biosynthesis in the shoot tip and the expanding leaves, contributing to an understanding of the requirements for efficient orchard application of foliar sprays of paclobutrazol.",
