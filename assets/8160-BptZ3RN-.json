In treated rabbits, a decrease in hemoglobin, a 20-25% decrease in red blood cell count, and marked hemoglobinuria and/or hematuria were observed; for each dose group, some rabbits had almost normal values while others were severely affected ... /The rabbits also/ exhibited renal effects. Necropsy revealed bloody kidneys and the presence of large quantities of blood in the bladder (hematuria). The severity of the histopathological renal lesions (necrotizing, hemorrhagic, and atrophic acute tubular nephrosis with occasional glomemlar lesions) was reported to be dose-related, but the specific doses at which they occurred were not reported. Histopathologic examination of a section from the kidney of a rabbit treated with 10,000 mg/kg 2-butoxyethanol acetate showed atrophic tubular dilation, tubular fatty degeneration, vacuolar degeneration, and hemosiderin deposits in the glomerulus and the tubular cells, with glomerular retraction and luminar hyaline deposits, luminar granular deposits, foci of cellular lysis, occasional interstitial fibro-inflammatory organization, and parietal atrophy. Presumably, some of these lesions were also observed in rabbits that died. When the surviving animals were sacrificed after the 2-week observation period, no gross pathologic or histopathological lesions in the kidney were noted ... When 2-butoxyethanol acetate was tested for primary irritation of the skin, four of six rabbits showed slight erythema (grade 1) at 24 hours ..."

The erythema scores of exposure to 100% 2-butoxyethanol acetate for 4 hours in rabbits showed a ranking of 2, which is the minimal mean erythema needed to classify substances as skin irritants."

            "Value": "The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 2.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 18 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.26 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 300 and 30 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2). Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC)."
