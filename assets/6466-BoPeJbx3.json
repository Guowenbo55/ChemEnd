    "Description": "Gibberellin A3 is a C19-gibberellin that is a pentacyclic diterpenoid responsible for promoting growth and elongation of cells in plants. Initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi,it differs from gibberellin A1 in the presence of a double bond between C-3 and C-4. It has a role as a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a lactone, a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a C19-gibberellin. It is a conjugate acid of a gibberellin A3(1-).",

Rats of both sexes were fed diets containing Gibberellic Acid (GA3, purity 88.5%) at concentrations of 0, 1,000, 10,000, or 50,000 ppm for 13 weeks. A group of control animals and high-dose animals were fed regular rodent diet for an additional 4-week recovery period. The consumption of test materials was 53-117, 550-1178, or 2994-5786 mg/kg/day (males) and 67-130, 730-1283, or 3872-6241 mg/kg/day (females). The only treatment-related clinical sign of toxicity was a low incidence of soft stools in both sexes receiving the highest dose. Very slightly decreased body weight gains were observed in mid-dose males and high dose animals of both sexes. Slightly increased total food consumption in all treated groups were observed. Evidence suggestive of a compound-related effect on kidney function included significantly increased blood urea nitrogen levels (BUN) and increased relative kidney weights in female rats in the high-dose group. BUN levels and kidney weights were comparable to controls at the end of a 4-week recovery period, indicating reversibility of renal effects. Other effects observed in high-dose males included decreased globulin levels at termination of the study and decreased glucose levels (p</= 0.05) at the end of the 4-week recovery period. increased relative liver weights were observed in males at 50,000 ppm and in females at 10,000 ppm and 50,000 ppm. At the end of the recovery period, increased relative liver weight were still evident in females (11%), but not in males. In the absence of clinical chemistry correlates and gross and microscopic hepatic abnormalities, the liver weight changes are considered compensatory rather than a toxic effect of the test material. Under the conditions of this study, the NOEL is 10,000 ppm; the LOEL is 50,000 ppm, based on the occurrence of soft stools in both sexes, and increased BUN levels, liver and kidney weights in females. /Gibberellic acid, purity 88.5%/"

Additional groups of 10 control and 10 high-dose animals were held for a 4-week recovery period. The 25,000 ppm exposure group was fed a diet containing 50,000 ppm during the first 14 days of the study; however, due to low weight gain and clinical signs the dosage was reduced for the duration of the study. The average calculated doses for the 1,000, 10,000, and 25,000 ppm groups, the latter corrected for exposure to 50,000 ppm, were 67, 704, and 2238 mg/kg/day for males and 85, 814, and 2403 mg/kg/day for females. No treatment-related effects were observed at the 1,000 or 10,000 ppm dietary levels. One male in the 25,000 ppm treatment group died during the third week of the study. Compare to controls, treatment of rats of both sexes at 25,000 ppm had significant effects on clinical signs, food consumption (during the first 5 weeks of the study), body weight, organ-to-body weight ratios, hematology, clinical chemistry and gross microscopic pathology. Clinical signs in the high-dose groups included hunched posture, thin rough coat, a body crust on the nose and urine stains. Body weights for males and females were significantly lower than controls throughout the study, including the recovery phase. There was a marked increase in body weights when the treatment was reduced from 50,000 to 25,000 ppm after 14 days, and by the end of the recovery period at week 17, body weights were within 91% of control groups for both sexes. Males had significantly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit values and significantly lower total bilirubin, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase values. Females had significantly lower total protein, albumin and calcium values and significantly higher globulin, total bilirubin, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase values. Both sexes had significantly increased relative brain weights and males had significantly increased relative kidney and testis weights. Gross pathological changes in the kidneys (rough surfaces and depressed areas in the cortex) were present in both sexes. Histologically, chronic tubular nephritis, tubular dilation, and focal loss of nephrons were observed. Histological changes in the liver were marginal in incidence and severity. Under the conditions of the study, the NOEL is 10,000 ppm; the LOEL is 25,000 ppm based on alterations in clinical chemistry, decreased food consumption, decreased body weights, increases in relative organ weights (brain, kidney, and testis), and gross and histopathological changes in the kidney. /Gibberellins, purity 85.5%/"

Virus in blood, brain, and other organs was assayed by a cytochemical method. Immunotoxicity was measured. Age and sex of mice profoundly influenced many immune parameters. Old male and female mice were significantly heavier, and had significantly lighter thymuses, lower hemolysin titers, and fewer plaque forming cells. Mean number of circulating white blood cells was significantly greater in old mice than in young females. Plant growth stimulators significantly decreased body wt of old females but did not affect young females or old males. Gibberellic acid lengthened the duration of the virus induced viremia.
