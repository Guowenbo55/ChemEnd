A fungicide used to control major plant pathogens including Septoria tritici, Puccinia spp. and Pyrenophora teres. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of pyrazoles, a carbamate ester, an aromatic ether, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a methoxycarbanilate strobilurin antifungal agent and a carbanilate fungicide.",

In hydroponic conditions, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin mainly accumulated in cucumber roots, while azoxystrobin accumulated in leaves. Subcellularly, azoxystrobin accumulated as a soluble component, while pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin accumulated more in organelles and cell walls. Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin primarily entered roots via the apoplast pathway, whereas trifloxystrobin entered through the symplastic pathway. Azoxystrobin could be transported in cucumbers through anion and cation channels, while pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin were transported only through anion channels. This study is significant for evaluating environmental risks and food safety related to these fungicides.",

This study aimed to determine the translocation pattern of three fungicides with different modes of action applied as seed treatments and the effect of soil type on translocation. Results showed that most of the absorbed radioactivity was concentrated in the cotyledons, with the maximum sum of absorption rates by roots, stems, and leaves of the plants being 15%. Absorption by roots, stems, and leaves was generally lower than 5% for 14C-pyraclostrobin and 14C-metalaxyl, and 1.6% for 14C-carbendazim. Fungicide absorption by roots and whole seedlings was higher in soil with lower organic matter content. Fungicides absorbed by cotyledons are unlikely to be redistributed and are lost when cotyledons fall off. These findings enhance our understanding of seed treatment fungicide movement in soybean seedlings and may aid in developing seed treatment strategies for managing seed and soilborne pathogens.",
