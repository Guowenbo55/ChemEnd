In 10 days, approximately 60% of sodium lauryl sulfate, present at 10 mg/kg, was mineralized in a creosote-contaminated sandy loam soil; the rate of biodegradation decreased slightly at higher concentrations(2). The biodegradation of sodium lauryl sulfate varied considerably in river water samples collected from four locations of a polluted river at two times(3). The time to removal of approximately 80% of the initial concentration (approximately 25 ppm) of sodium lauryl sulfate ranged from 50-140 hours depending upon the season in which the samples were collected and the inoculum source(3)."
