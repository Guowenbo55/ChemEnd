    "Description": "Quinclorac is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid that is quinoline-8-carboxylic acid in which the hydrogens at positions 3 and 7 have been replaced by chlorines. It is used (particularly as its dimethylamine salt, known as quinclorac-dimethylammonium) as a (rather persistent) herbicide for the post-emergence control of weeds in rice, grass and turf. It is not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and a synthetic auxin. It is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid, an organochlorine compound and a monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a quinclorac(1-).",

Interestingly, while both biotypes absorbed quinclorac similarly, the distribution within the plants differed significantly. S-BYG retained more 14C in the treated leaf compared to R-BYG, indicating different translocation patterns. R-BYG showed higher acropetal translocation, moving 14C more into leaves above the treated leaf than S-BYG, possibly due to reduced herbicide sequestration or increased binding affinity within the treated leaf. Conversely, S-BYG exhibited higher retention in the treated leaf and slower translocation, suggesting potential herbicide immobilization. Notably, minimal 14C was detected in roots, but R-BYG exuded more quinclorac into the growth media, possibly due to herbicide-induced damage or metabolic differences. These variations in translocation might not explain the quinclorac resistance fully, necessitating further research to clarify if it involves metabolism or altered binding proteins affecting herbicide movement within the plants.",

After 12 HAT, 20 and 15% of the amount absorbed had been translocated basipetally by R-BYG and S-BYG, respectively. At 72 HAT, 27 and 17% of the total absorbed 14C had been translocated acropetally by R-BYG and S-BYG, respectively. The levels of 14C above the treated leaf continued to increase throughout the duration of the experiment in R-BYG while levels of 14C above the treated leaf in S-BYG remained relatively constant. Seven percent more of the total absorbed 14C was exuded from roots of R-BYG than S-BYG at 72 HAT. Although differential translocation was observed between R-BYG and S-BYG, it is unclear whether this difference is a cause of quinclorac resistance or an effect of some other physiological process. Further research is needed to determine if differential translocation is due to metabolism or other physiological factors",

Over the exposure period, the absorption curve for D. sanguinalis was curvilinear, with the maximum absorption occurring approximately 48 h after exposure. The response curve for E. indica was linear across the exposure period. Results from the translocation studies showed that 95% of the absorbed 14C-quinclorac remained in the treated leaf for D. sanguinalis after 80 h. However, only 58% of the absorbed 14C remained in the treated leaf of E. indica. Most of the 14C translocated out of the leaves moved to the tiller, the crown, and new leaf tissue. There was no appreciable exudation of 14C-quinclorac by either species during the absorption period. Results of the metabolism studies showed that neither the susceptible species (D. sanguinalis) nor the tolerant species (E. indica) metabolized the parent quinclorac herbicide. Spray retention studies showed that E. indica (tolerant) retained more applied quinclorac than D. sanguinalis (sensitive).

At 0.5 h, quinclorac uptake was 85% in southern crabgrass and 66% in bluegrass. Uptake and distribution differed between species. By 128 h, Kentucky bluegrass had uniformly distributed quinclorac and exuded 17% into the nutrient solution. Metabolism of quinclorac was limited to less than 3.6% of the applied 14C in the two species, at 128 h. Selectivity of quinclorac may be influenced by differences in uptake, distribution, and exudation by the roots but not by metabolism.",
