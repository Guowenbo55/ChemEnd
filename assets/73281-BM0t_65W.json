            "content": "Nicosulfuron provides POST weed control in corn, pastures, and grassy roadsides, and has potential for use in fine turfgrass. The objective of this research was to evaluate tolerance, absorption, translocation, and metabolism of nicosulfuron in annual bluegrass and four turfgrass species. In greenhouse experiments, relative tolerance of grasses to nicosulfuron (35, 70, or 140 g ai ha\u22121) from high to low was bermudagrass = zoysiagrass > tall fescue > creeping bentgrass > annual bluegrass. In laboratory experiments, grasses had similar foliar and root absorption of 14C-nicosulfuon. Annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass averaged 80% greater radioactivity per unit dry mass in shoots than bermudagrass following root uptake of 14C-nicosulfuron, but other species were similar to these grasses. At 72 h after treatment (HAT), annual bluegrass metabolized 36% of absorbed 14C-nicosulfuron, which was less than bermudagrass, tall fescue, and zoysiagrass that metabolized 47 to 58%. Creeping bentgrass metabolism of nicosulfuron was similar to annual bluegrass. Tall fescue had similar levels of metabolism to bermudagrass and zoysiagrass, averaging 67%, at 168 HAT but produced fewer metabolites. Overall, turfgrass tolerance to nicosulfuron is associated with relative herbicide concentrations in shoots and differential species metabolism.",

(smooth crabgrass) are not effectively controlled by nicosulfuron and rimsulfuron even at the highest recommended application rates. However, Panicum miliaceum L. (wild proso millet), Amaranthus retroflexus L. (redroot pigweed), and Avena fatua L. (wild oat) are susceptible to these herbicides. The foliar absorption and translocation of 14C-nicosulfuron and 14C-rimsulfuron were studied in these weed species up to 48 hours after treatment (HAT). It was observed that differences in herbicide uptake and translocation were not correlated with the species' susceptibility. By 48 HAT, more than 50% of both herbicides remained on the treated leaf surface. Foliar absorption of rimsulfuron was found to be greater than that of nicosulfuron in A. retroflexus, P. miliaceum, and A. artemisiifolia. Most of the absorbed herbicide remained in the treated leaf of each weed species. The export of 14C-nicosulfuron ranged from 28% to 54% of that absorbed, while it was 15% to 39% for 14C-rimsulfuron. The absorption and translocation rates of both herbicides were highest within the initial 6 HAT and decreased thereafter. Both herbicides showed approximately the same distribution pattern within each weed species.",
