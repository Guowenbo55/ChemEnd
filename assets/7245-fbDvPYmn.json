In an aerobic screening test, the microorganism Pseudomonas gladioli was able to degrade 2-chlorophenol 74.6% after an incubation period of 24 hours and an initial concn of 8.78 ug/ml(2). 2-Chlorophenol was 100% degraded by a microbial mixture inoculum after an incubation time of 96 hours(3). The aerobic biodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in the cyclone fermentor system revealed 0% remaining after 200 hours and a lag time of 25 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 140 hours(4). Incubation at 30 \u00b0C resulted in incomplete removal of 2-chlorophenol, which ceased after 48 hours. 64.8% of 2-chlorophenol was removed; however, only 30.2% of the total chloride was released. Degradation proceeded via meta-cleavage and a build-up of the metabolite 3-chlorocatechol was observed(5). 2-Chlorophenol reached 38.0% of its theoretical BOD in river water obtained from the Jilin section of the Songhua River, China. A test concn of 2 mg/L (based on the Theoretical Oxygen Demand for 2-chlorophenol) was tested at 15-20 \u00b0C, pH 6.8-7.0, and a dissolved oxygen concn of 8.0 mg/L using standard iodometric tritration(6)."

Addition of seed water from prior die-away testing led to faster complete removal of 2-chlorophenol in seeded vs unseeded Great Miami River, Ohio water (15 days vs 36 days), whereas time for complete removal in seeded Little Miami River,Ohio water was nearly the same as that in unseeded water (15 days vs 13 days)(6). A loss of 94% was reported for 2-chlorophenol incubated in non-sterile clay loam soil at 4 \u00b0C in 6.5 hrs and 1% loss in sterile soil in 12 days(2). Complete removal of 2-chlorophenol was reported in 14 and 47 days in Dunkirk and Mardin silt loam suspensions, respectively(3).

            "Value": "ANAEROBIC: An anaerobic gas production test of sewage sludge, a freshwater swamp sediment and a marine sediment was conducted. Results revealed 0 to 30% mineralization of 2-chlorophenol in digested sewage sludge after an incubation period of 56 days, 30 to 75% mineralization in freshwater swamp sediment after an incubation period of 56 days, and 0 to 30% mineralization in marine sediment after an incubation period of 96 days(1). The rate of 2-chlorophenol transformation in anaerobic estuarine sediment was determined to be 0.101/day, which corresponds to a half-life of 6.9 days(2). After a 30 day acclimation period, 2-chlorophenol was degraded with ease by soil microorganisms under nitrate-reducing conditions; 21% was biodegraded in 3 days and by 6 days, 2-chlorophenol reached low concns(3). The anaerobic degradation of 2-chlorophenol in the cyclone fermentor system resulted in 44% remaining after 500 hours and a lag time of 250 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 475 hours(4). Incubation of 2-chlorophenol with sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions gave the following results: complete disappearance of 2-chlorophenol in 6 weeks with no lag period using unacclimated sludge; approximately 100% loss of 2-chlorophenol in 4 or 32 days with no lag period using sludge acclimated to 2- or 4-chlorophenol(5). Using 14C-labeled-2-chlorophenol in anaerobic sludge acclimated to 2-chlorophenol, >90% of total (14)C added was recovered as (14)CH4 and (14)CO2(5). Complete removal of 2-chlorophenol was achieved within 50 days in anaerobic sediment obtained from Lake Michigan. The major metabolites were phenol and 3-chlorobenzoate(6). 2-Chlorophenol biodegrades in the absence of oxygen under methanogenic, sulfidogenic, iron-reducing, and denitrifying conditions(7). The half-life of 2-chlorophenol in sub-soils under landfills was 51 and 110 days in coarse sand and sandy loam, respectively(8). 2-Chlorophenol (500 ug/L) was persistent in anaerobic sand and gravel after 2 weeks in a model ecosystem consisting of a laboratory filter operating with anaerobic groundwater(9)."

            "Value": "The major mode of action of chlorophenols appears to be the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The strength of the uncoupling effect is related to the degree of chlorination: PCP is the strongest inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, MCP the weakest. To a lesser extent, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation is affected by the positions of the chlorine atoms on the molecule. There appears to be a relationship between chlorination and the toxicity of PCP and T4CP, although there is no clear-cut relationship between the degree of chlorination and toxicityin MCP, DCP, and the T3CP series. /chlorophenols/"
